Abstract = {{Pristine germanene is a zero-gap semi-metal, which may hinder its
   practical application in semiconducting devices. Here, on the basis of
   the structural characteristics of digermyl ether, we theoretically
   design a two-dimensional crystal, namely germanether. Germanether
   exhibits excellent dynamical and thermal stability. It possesses an
   indirect band gap of 1.37 eV and a high electron mobility of 2.32 x
   10(3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The uniaxial strain and layer stacking order can
   trigger an indirect-to-direct band gap transition. More interestingly,
   germanether has remarkable in-plane negative Poisson's ratios with the
   largest one (similar to-0.2) five times of borophenes and three times of
   penta-graphene. The negative Poisson's ratio arises from the interplay
   of Ge-O tetrahedron symmetry and Ge-4d orbitals involvement, which is
   different from previously reported auxetic materials. All these findings
   render germanether is a competitive material for the future application
   in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.}},

Title = {{Programmable soft bending actuators with auxetic metamaterials}},

Abstract = {{Soft robotics has been receiving increasing attention due to its
   flexibility and adaptability offered by embodied intelligence. A soft
   robot may undergo complex motions including stretching, contraction,
   bending, twisting, and their intricate combinations. Among these basic
   motions, bending plays a central role when a robot accomplishes tasks
   such as locomotion, grasping and manipulation. Although a rich
   repertoire of bending mechanisms has been reported, a systematic and
   rational design framework is still lack. In this paper, we provide a
   novel design strategy for soft bending actuators which allows integral
   modeling and design optimization. Nowadays, metamaterials are emerging
   as a new tool for soft robots, by encoding the desired complex motions
   directly within the material architectures, leading to conformable
   monolithic systems. We combine pneumatic actuators and flexible
   metamaterials to provide an alternative solution to soft bending
   actuators, with advantages of compact design, large bending motion, and
   convenient fabrication. A regular pneumatic chamber is embedded inside
   auxetic and non-auxetic metamaterials, and bending is generated when
   inflated. We carry out dimensionless analysis to identify the key design
   variables. To provide insight into design optimization, we develop a
   computation framework by modeling metamaterial structures with beam
   elements and the inner chamber with shell elements as an integral part,
   allowing efficient simulation of the coupled system. We systematically
   investigate how the bending angle varies with the key design variables
   and find the optimal design parameters. The experimental results are
   well in line with the simulation, and a remarkable bending motion of
   0.437mm is achieved.}},

   irregular hexachiral honeycombs}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The highly symmetric hexachiral honeycomb with an isotropic Poisson's
   ratio of -1 is one of the earliest and most well-known examples of
   auxetic mechanical metamaterials and has been proposed for numerous
   applications ranging from satellite antennas to stents. In this work, we
   propose a novel, less symmetric generic form of the hexachiral honeycomb
   that is made up of three sets of unequally sized ligaments rather than
   six identical ones and has the potential to exhibit a wide range of
   negative Poisson's ratios. Using finite element analysis, we
   investigated the deformation behaviour of these generic hexachiral
   systems and derived an analytical model which may be used to predict the
   Poisson's ratio of these systems. The results obtained indicate that the
   hexachiral topology is extremely versatile with respect to its potential
   to exhibit diverse mechanical properties and it is hoped that this added
   tenability will enhance the functionality and applicability of this
   class of auxetic mechanical metamaterials.}},

Title = {{Auxetic tubular scaffolds via melt electrowriting}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{193}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Auxetics are an interesting class of materials that expand in transverse
   directions when tensile loading is applied. For example, in contrast to
   conventional materials, an auxetic tube will increase in diameter when
   stretched along its axis. To date, auxetic tubular scaffolds have been
   proposed for applications in tissue engineering and soft robotics;
   however, they have not yet been routinely produced in
   precisely-engineered microfibre structures using the melt electrowriting
   additive manufacturing method. Using a custom melt electrowriting device
   and rotating mandrel collector, scaffolds with a re-entrant honeycomb
   unit cell pattern were designed and fabricated from polycaprolactone
   microfibres. These scaffolds were tensile tested to characterise their
   auxetic properties compared to traditional crosshatch-patterned tubular
   scaffolds. The auxetic scaffolds exhibited an increase in diameter up to
   80.8\%, as predicted from the unit cell pattern at maximum strain of
   14.1\%, resulting in a Poisson's ratio of -5.8. By comparison,
   crosshatch scaffolds exhibited a similar stress-strain profile to the
   auxetic tubular scaffold with identical pore size, however significant
   radial compression was observed leading to a Poisson's ratio of +5.7.
   This study reports the design and fabrication of auxetic tubular
   microfibre scaffolds fabricated via melt electrowriting for the first
   time and offers a versatile fibre patterning system towards applications
   in biofabrication and robotics. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Lower mass and higher performances of structure with Negative Poisson's
   Ratio (NPR) make it a promising option in vehicle design. In this work,
   a new NPR structure is introduced and analyzed. The new NPR structure
   has high shear strength and its effective Young's modulus increases as
   the load increases. Mathematical models are firstly established to study
   the unique properties of the NPR structure. The parameterized model of
   the structure is then built to study the performance of the structure
   under large deformations condition. Due to the complexities of the
   nonlinear properties, the hybrid and adaptive meta-model (HAM)
   optimization method is employed for optimizing the NPR structure. The
   optimization results are compared with those of traditional optimization
   method to validate the effectiveness of this approach. Quasi-static
   compressive experiments are also conducted to verify the accuracy of the
   model and the effectiveness of the optimization. The results show that
   the NPR structure is optimized successfully and the HAM optimization
   method is of great effectiveness in finding the optimal NPR structure.}},

   proposed to detect the existence and number of the periodic solutions.
   The theoretical analyses indicate the existence of periodic orbits and
   can guarantee at most four periodic orbits under certain conditions.
   Numerical simulations are performed to verify the theoretical results.
   The relative positons as well as the vibration characteristics can also
   be clearly found from the phase portraits. The periodic motion for the
   equation is closely related to the amplitude modulated periodic
   vibrations of the plate. The results will provide theoretical guidance
   to nonlinear vibration control for the metamaterial honeycomb sandwich
   structures.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{859}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio structure is one of the international research
   hotspots, but there are still few reports on negative Poisson's ratio
   combination structure. In this paper, two single cell structures
   (concave hexagonal structure and star shape structure) with connection
   beam and three nine-grid combination structures (X-type, H-type,
   Sd-type) were designed. To obtain the negative Poisson's ratio
   mechanics, based on the Euler beam theory, the theoretical calculation
   method of single cell structure was established. By comparing the
   critical force, the sequence of bending and stretching/compression
   deformation was discussed. The mechanical properties of multi-cell
   structures were predicted by adopting the mixed law. The results show
   that the main deformation of the designed structures are bending, and
   the instability buckling occurs during compression. It is proved that
   the mechanical properties of multi-cell structures can be characterized
   by its single cell structure. The combination structure integrates the
   negative Poisson's ratio mechanical properties of different single cell
   structures. An important application is that the mechanical properties
   of combination structures can be obtained by changing the proportion of
   single cell structures without changing the structure size. (C) 2020

Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the longitudinal wave speed through a plate in
   which its two opposing sides are elastically restrained in the width
   direction, taking into consideration the material auxeticity and strain
   as well as changes to the density and cross-sectional area. Apart from
   the known role of Young's modulus and density, the present results
   reveal that the wave speed can be enhanced by increasing the width
   elastic restraint. In the case of high elastic restraint, the speed of
   both tensile and compressive waves can be minimized by selecting plate
   materials with Poisson's ratio of low magnitude. In the case of low
   elastic restraint, the speed of tensile and compressive waves can be
   greatly reduced by selecting plate materials with large positive and
   large negative Poisson's ratio, respectively. For the special case of
   negligible strain, the longitudinal wave speed reduces to the elementary
   wave speed in prismatic rods and in plates of infinite width when the
   width elastic restraint stiffness approaches zero and infinity,
   respectively. The obtained results not only avail more parameters for
   adjusting the longitudinal waves in plates, but also identify the
   differing methods of effectively controlling the wave speed between
   tensile and compressive waves when the strain magnitude is
   non-negligible.}},

Abstract = {{The adaptive mode of frictional interaction has been studied as a
   self-locking effect upon contact deformation of isotropic and
   anisotropic auxetic materials with a negative Poisson ratio. This effect
   manifests itself in the fact that the bearing capacity of the joint
   rises with increasing shear load. In particular, the parameters of
   stress state (contact load, tangential stresses, slippage, etc.) were
   determined for a double-lap joint under conditions of compression with
   or without shear. The contact interaction was analyzed by the
   finite-element method for three profiles of symmetrically located
   contact elements (plane, cylindrical, and wedge-shaped). The Poisson
   ratio was varied within the range theoretically admissible for isotropic
   elastic media. Analogous calculations were also performed for a joint
   with a deformed element made of an anisotropic auxetic composite, whose
   reinforcement angle was varied. The maximum loads, tangential stresses,
   and slippage are obtained as nonlinear functions of Poisson ratio (in
   the isotropic case) and reinforcement angle of the composite material.
   The stress concentration and the increased ultimate shear forces are
   also estimated.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure of wood is highly anisotropic, which suggests that
   this material could exhibit unusual elastic properties. A few studies
   have suggested the possibility of auxeticity, or negative Poisson's

   wood does show NPR, we have used a combination of geometric modelling,
   finite element analysis (FEA) and off-axis compression testing. The
   geometric model indicates that idealised thin-walled wood cell
   structures should generate NPR of -1, FEA suggests that more realistic
   cell arrays can attain NPR, to -0.27, and compression tests show that
   some NPR - to -0.74 - remains in real wood samples. These results could

Abstract = {{Auxetic textiles belong to a class of extraordinary materials that
   become fatter when stretched. Sustained efforts to fabricate auxetic
   fabric structures are limited. Indeed, several geometrical
   configurations have been previously proposed but none has been
   engineered into functional auxetic textile fabrics. The use of auxetic
   materials has been limited because of problems with deploying them in
   their fabricated forms. Our thrust in this research is to combine our
   knowledge of geometry and fabric structural characteristics to engineer
   auxetic textiles and to determine the properties of such auxetic textile
   fabrics. In this paper, we have presented the technique we developed for
   producing several knit structures in which filling yarn inlays are used
   to effect compound repeating units. In these productions, the chain is
   used as a base structure and a minimum of two guide bars and maximum of
   six guide bars are deployed to produce such warp knit auxetic fabrics.}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropic textiles are commonly used in wearable applications to
   achieve varied bi-axial stress-strain behavior around the body. Auxetic
   textiles, specifically those that exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio
   (v), likewise exhibit intriguing behavior such as volume increase in
   response to impact or variable air permeability. Active textiles are
   traditional textile structures that integrate smart materials, such as
   shape memory alloys, shape memory polymers, or carbon nanotubes, to
   enable spatial actuation behavior, such as contraction for on-body
   compression or corrugation for haptic feedback. This research is a first
   experimental investigation into active auxetic and shearing textile
   structures. These textile structures leverage the bending- and
   torsional-deformations of the fibers/filaments within traditional
   textile structures as well as the shape memory effect of shape memory
   alloys to achieve novel, spatial performance. Five textile structures
   were fabricated from shape memory alloy wire deformed into needle lace
   and weft knit textile structures. All active structures exhibited
   anisotropic behavior and four of the five structures exhibited auxetic
   behavior upon free recovery, contracting in both x- and y-axes upon
   actuation (v = -0.3 to -1.5). One structure exhibited novel shearing
   behavior, with a mean free angle recovery of 7 degrees.
   Temperature-controlled biaxial tensile testing was conducted to
   experimentally investigate actuation behavior and anisotropy of the
   designed structures. The presented design and performance of these
   active auxetic, anisotropic, and shearing textiles inspire new
   capabilities for applications, such as smart wearables, soft robotics,
   reconfigurable aerospace structures, and medical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Designing micro-structures that lead to materials with negative
   Poisson's ratio, the so-called auxetics, is studied here with techniques
   of topology optimization for compliant mechanisms. Compliant mechanisms
   are monolithic structures that are able to deliver two or more different
   motions depending on the applied loading. Single and multi-objective
   topology optimization problems for the design of compliant mechanisms
   are formulated. This formulation together with simple homogenization
   thoughts links the behavior of the flexible microstructure with the
   overall, homogenized continuum and, in particular, the negative
   Poisson's ratio effect (auxetic material). Due to the local minima that
   arise, iterative local search methods are not very effective. On the
   other hand genuine global optimization algorithms may become too
   expensive, due to the large number of design variables. A hybrid method
   based on global optimization algorithms such as Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE), using an iterative
   local search method as an evaluation tool is proposed and tested. The
   iterative local method is based on discretization of the design space
   with truss elements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Unit Geometry under Tensile Load}},
Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports the auxetic behavior of modified conventional
   non-woven fabric. The auxetic behavior of fabric was achieved by forming
   rotating square unit geometry with a highly ordered pattern of slits by
   laser cutting. Two commercial needle-punched non-woven fabric used as
   lining and the reinforcement fabric for the footwear industry were
   investigated. The influence of two rotating square unit sizes was
   analyzed for each fabric. The original and modified fabric samples were
   subjected to quasi-static tensile load by using the Tinius Olsen testing
   machine to observe the in-plane mechanical properties and deformation
   behavior of tested samples. The tests were recorded with a full
   high-definition (HD) digital camera and the video recognition technique
   was applied to determine the Poisson's ratio evolution during testing.
   The results show that the modified samples exhibit a much lower breaking
   force due to induced slits, which in turn limits the application of such
   modified fabric to low tensile loads. The samples with smaller rotating
   cell sizes exhibit the highest negative Poisson's ratio during tensile
   loading through the entire longitudinal strain range until rupture.
   Non-woven fabric with equal distribution and orientation of fibers in
   both directions offer better auxetic response with a smaller
   out-of-plane rotation of rotating unit cells. The out-of-plane rotation
   of unit cells in non-homogenous samples is higher in machine direction.}},

Title = {{The Push Drill Mechanism as a Novel Method to Create 3D Mechanical
   Metamaterial Structures}},
Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Two of the most prominent 2D auxetic mechanisms, namely, the rotating
   rigid unit and the chiral systems, work, at least partly, by converting
   linear to rotational motion. This property can be harnessed by
   introducing a system that can convert back the rotational motion to a
   linear displacement so as to induce an expansion or a compression in the
   out-of-plane direction. The push drill mechanism offers an effective way
   of providing this capability. It is, hence, possible to couple 2D
   rotating rigid unit or chiral structures to the push drill mechanism to
   create novel 3D auxetic structures. The resultant Poisson's ratio in the
   out-of-plane direction can be both negative and positive depending on
   the connectivity. Herein, the concept is illustrated with the use of
   rotating squares. An analytical model is derived to determine the
   parameters on which Poisson's ratio and Young's moduli depend.
   Subsequently, the analytical results are compared with those obtained
   from experimental testing of different sample structures with the two
   showing good agreement. Further considerations indicate that it is
   possible to design 2D and 3D auxetic systems with the push drill as the
   only deformation mechanism.}},

Title = {{Geometric Non-Linear Analysis of Auxetic Hybrid Laminated Beams
   Containing CNT Reinforced Composite Materials}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In the current work, a novel hybrid laminate with negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) is developed by considering auxetic laminate which is
   composed of carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) and
   fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) materials. The maximum magnitude of
   out-of-plane NPR is identified in the case of (20(F)/20 (c)/-20 (c)/20
   (c))(S)laminate as well. Meanwhile, a method for the geometric
   non-linear analysis of hybrid laminated beam with NPR including the
   non-linear bending, free, and forced vibrations is proposed. The beam
   deformation is modeled by combining higher-order shear-deformation
   theory (HSDT) and large deflection theory. Based on a two-step
   perturbation approach, the asymptotic solutions of the governing
   equations are obtained to capture the linear and non-linear frequencies
   and load-deflection curves. Moreover, a two-step perturbation
   methodology in conjunction with fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is
   employed to solve the forced-vibration problem. Several key factors,
   such as CNT distribution, variations in the elastic foundation, and
   thermal stress, are considered in the exhaustive analysis. Theoretical
   results for some particular cases are given to examine the geometric
   non-linearity behavior of hybrid beam with NPR as well as positive
   Poisson's ratio (PPR).}},

Abstract = {{The work studies the mechanical properties of chiral metallic nanotubes
   by the molecular statics method. The atomic structure of nanotubes was
   obtained by rolling up thin nanoplates from cubic crystals of copper,
   iron, aluminum, and cobalt with the (010) orientation at various chiral
   angles. It is shown that such nanotubes can experience torsion under
   tension and their Poisson's ratio decreases with increasing chiral angle
   within the range from 0 degrees to 45 degrees. Poisson's ratio of
   stretched copper and cobalt nanotubes becomes negative at certain chiral
   angles. A relationship is determined between the uniaxial deformation of
   nanotubes and their torsion at different chiral angles (reverse
   Poynting's effect). As the chiral angle increases, Young's modulus of
   nanotubes also increases. Atomistic modeling results are shown to agree
   qualitatively well with theoretical estimates obtained in the framework
   of anisotropic elasticity, but with significant quantitative differences
   for various crystalline materials.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in auxetic materials is of great interest
   due to the typically enhanced toughness, shear resistance, and sound and
   vibration absorption, which enables plenty of novel applications such as
   aerospace and defense. Insight into the mechanism underlying NPR is
   significant to the design of auxetic nanomaterials and nanostructures.
   However, the analysis of NPR in previous studies mainly remains on the
   level of the evolution of geometry parameters, such as bond length and
   bond angle, while a thorough and fundamental understanding is lacking.
   In this paper, we report anisotropic differential NPR in graphene for
   uniaxial strains applied along both zigzag and armchair directions based
   on first-principles calculations. The mechanism underlying the emergence
   of NPR in graphene (evolution of bond length and bond angle) is found to
   be different from the conclusions from previous classical molecular
   dynamics simulations with empirical potential. We propose that the
   decentralized electron localization function (ELF) driven by strain
   leads to ELF coupling between different types of bonds, which results in
   the counter-intuitive anomalous increase of the bond angle and thus the
   emergence of NPR in graphene. Moreover, the NPR phenomenon can be
   anticipated to emerge in other nanomaterials or nanostructures with a
   similar honeycomb structure as that of graphene, where the ELF coupling
   would also be possible.}},

Abstract = {{The variation of through-thickness Poisson's ratio with fibre type and
   orientation has been investigated using a specially developed Fortran
   program. Glass fibre/epoxy resin composites were always found to be
   conventional, but negative Poisson's ratio values of up to nu(13) =
   -0,746 were produced over certain orientation angles for Kevlar and
   carbon reinforcements. This underlines the need for anisotropic pre-preg
   material. A range of {[}+/-beta/+/-theta](s) angles were investigated
   for carbon fibre laminates and it was found that auxetic behaviour could
   be generated for beta up to 45 degrees. All the findings of this work
   have extended the range of laminates which can be engineered to be
   auxetic either by material (i.e. Kevlar as well as carbon) or by
   orientation (i.e. by introducing further beta layers other than the 0
   degrees and 90 degrees previously investigated). (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel periodic auxetic cellular structure (PACS)
   whose cells were spanned as warp and woof. Warp and woof periodic
   auxetic cellular structure (WWPACS) is compressed in two transverse
   directions when quasi-static compressive loading is applied. In this
   paper, among different available manufacturing processes of auxetic
   structures, interlocking assembly method was used to fabricate the
   periodic cellular structure. To this end, the effects of NPR and
   mechanical behavior of auxetic structure were investigated and results
   compared with 3D finite element simulation. Good agreements were found
   between the experimental and FE results. The total energy and specific
   energy absorbed for experimental works and FE simulation were
   calculated. Furthermore, the effect of re-entrant angle on NPR was also
   obtained. The results show that the NPR increases and reaches to maximum
   value and then, due to overlaying the cellular, decreases. FE
   simulations show that the effect of structural geometry on NPR is more
   important than that of the materials used in the structure. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{To make lattice structures have both load-bearing and energy absorption
   characteristics to protect the safety of personnel and equipment in the
   collision, this paper proposes a multi-objective topology optimisation
   method for the design of lattice structures with negative Poisson's
   ratio. The energy absorption and load-bearing characteristics of the
   lattice structure are characterised by negative Poisson's ratio and
   stiffness, respectively. A topology optimisation model is established to
   maximise the stiffness and negative Poisson's ratio of the lattice
   structure. The design optimisation of microscopic material is conducted
   by the energy homogenisation method. A modified optimality criteria
   method is employed to update design variables. The energy absorption and
   load-bearing characteristics of the optimised structure are tested and
   analysed by finite element simulation and compression experiment,
   respectively. The results show that the optimised lattice structure has
   both energy absorption and load-bearing characteristics. In general, the
   proposed method can provide a feasible reference for the topology
   optimisation design of anti-collision structures.}},

Abstract = {{Laminated beams made of nanocomposite materials have been used in many
   industrial sectors. This paper reports a study on the vibration behavior
   of laminated beams when experiencing the large amplitude vibration. The
   beams are made of perfectly bonded carbon nanotube-reinforced composite
   (CNTRC) layers. The novel constructions of CNTRC laminated beams with
   out-of-plane maximum negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are proposed. The
   volume fraction of CNT may change across the beam thickness which
   results in a piece-wise pattern. The material properties of the CNTRC
   layers are temperature-dependent and can be estimated by the extended
   rule of mixture model. The beams are considered to rest on a
   two-parameter elastic foundation and under differential thermal
   environmental conditions. The higher order shear deformation beam theory
   is applied to derive the motion equations of the nonlinear vibration of
   FG-CNTRC laminated beams. These equations include the influencing
   factors such as the geometrical nonlinearity in the von Karman sense,
   the thermal effects and the beam-foundation interaction. The nonlinear
   vibration solutions can be obtained by employing a two-step perturbation
   approach. The nonlinear vibration characteristics of FG-CNTRC laminated
   beams under different sets of loading conditions and thermal
   environmental conditions are discussed in detail through a series of
   parametric studies. Numerical results show that the NPR has a
   significant effect on the large amplitude vibration characteristics of
   CNTRC laminated beams.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Planar auxetic structures have the potential to impact on a wide range
   of applications from deployable and morphing structures to space-filling
   composite and medical treatments. The ability to fabricate auxetics from
   smart materials greatly enhances this facility by building in
   controllable actuation and deployment. A smart auxetic device can be
   compressed and fixed into a storage state. When deployment is required
   the device can be appropriately stimulated and the stored elastic energy
   is released, resulting in a marked structural expansion. Instead of
   using a conventional external actuator to drive deployment the material
   is made to undergo phase transition where one stimulus (e.g. heat)
   initiates a mechanical response. Here we show how smart material
   auxetics can be realized using a thermally responsive shape memory
   polymer composites. We show how a shape memory polymer auxetic
   hexachiral structure can be tailored to provide a tunable stiffness
   response in its fully deployed state by varying the angle of inter-hub
   connections, and yet is still able to undergo thermally stimulated
   deployment.}},

Journal = {{2D MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Based on global optimization Cuttlefish algorithm, we predict a stable
   two-dimensional (2D) phase of boron phosphide with 1:5 stoichiometry,
   i.e. boron pentaphosphide (BP5) monolayer, which has a lower formation
   energy than that of the commonly believed graphitic phase (g-BP). BP5
   monolayer is a multiferroic material with coupled ferroelasticity and
   ferroelectricity. The predicted reversible strain is up to 41.41\%,
   which is the largest one among all reported ferroelastic materials. Due
   to the non-centrosymmetric structure and electronegativity differences
   between boron and phosphorus atoms, an in-plane spontaneous polarization
   of 1.63 x 10(-10) C m(-1) occurs in BP5. Moreover, the recently hunted
   negative Poisson's ratio property, is also observed in BP5. As an
   indirect semiconductor with a band gap of 1.34 eV, BP5 displays
   outstanding optical and electronic properties, for instance strongly
   anisotropic visible-light absorption and high carrier mobility. Finally,
   we demonstrate that AlN (0 1 0) surface could be a suitable substrate
   for epitaxy growth of BP5 monolayer. Due to the rich and extraordinary
   properties of BP5, it's considered to be a potential nanomaterial for
   designing electromechanical or optoelectronic devices, such as
   nonvolatile memory with conveniently readable/writeable capability.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanics of beam vibration is of fundamental importance in
   understanding the shift of resonant frequency of microcantilever and
   nanocantilever sensors. Unlike the simpler Euler-Bernoulli beam theory,
   the Timoshenko beam theory takes into consideration rotational inertia
   and shear deformation. For the case of microcantilevers and
   nanocantilevers, the minute size, and hence low mass, means that the
   topmost deviation from the Euler Bernoulli beam theory to be expected is
   shear deformation. This paper considers the extent of shear deformation
   for varying Poisson's ratio of the beam material, with special emphasis
   on solids with negative Poisson's ratio, which are also known as auxetic
   materials. Here, it is shown that the Timoshenko beam theory approaches
   the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory if the beams are of solid cross-sections
   and the beam material possess high auxeticity. However, the Timoshenko
   beam theory is significantly different from the Euler-Bernoulli beam
   theory for beams in the form of thin-walled tubes regardless of the beam
   material's Poisson's ratio. It is herein proposed that calculations on
   beam vibration can be greatly simplified for highly auxetic beams with
   solid cross-sections due to the small shear correction term in the
   Timoshenko beam de ection equation.}},

   purely geometric, relies on the evolution of the periodicity lattice and

   approximations, the auxetic capabilities of several well-known
   structures available in the literature. We propose new principles of

   provide an infinite supply of planar auxetic mechanisms and several new

Abstract = {{Auxetics occupy a special place among structural products working under
   cyclic loads, such as orthopedic implants, elements of building
   structures, etc. In this work, a three-dimensional auxetic structure
   (with Poisson's ratio of -0.450) was proposed and the mechanical
   characteristics were analyzed using static and low-cycle compression
   tests (up to 2000 cycles) by both testing physical samples obtained by
   3D-printing using SLM method and by running a computer simulation (FEA).
   The studied properties of auxetics were compared with the properties of
   a non-auxetic hexagonal honeycomb structure. It has been demonstrated
   that the auxetic structure is deformed uniformly during cyclic tests
   with a maximum load of 12 kN at a failure; accordingly, a non-auxetic
   structure loses stability at a load of 8 kN. The results can be used in
   the development of structural elements of biomedical devices operating
   under increased cyclic loads (spinal implants, bone implants for
   supporting limbs). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   pressure-loaded FG-GRMMC laminated cylindrical shells}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{243}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have emerged to be a new type of novel engineering
   materials with unique material properties. This paper reports the
   postbuckling behaviors of pressure loaded graphene-reinforced metal
   matrix composite (GRMMC) laminated cylindrical shells under the
   influence of in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in temperature
   environments. The GRMMCs have temperature-dependent material properties
   which can be determined using an extended micromechanical model of
   Halpin-Tsai type. A cylindrical shell is made of GRMMC layers of
   different graphene volume fractions to achieve a piece-wise functionally
   graded (FG) pattern. The postbuckling equations for the pressure-loaded
   GRMMC laminated cylindrical shells are derived using the Reddy's third
   order shear deformation shell theory with the effects of von K ` arm `
   an-type kinematic nonlinearity and temperature variation being included.
   Applying the singular perturbation technique in conjunction with a
   two-step perturbation approach, the governing equations for the shell
   postbuckling problem are solved. The results show that the postbuckling
   behaviors of pressure-loaded GRMMC laminated cylindrical shells are
   affected substantially by the in-plane NPR.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{When materials are under stretching, occurrence of lateral contraction
   of materials is commonly observed. This is because Poisson's ratio, the
   quantity describes the relationship between a lateral strain and applied
   strain, is positive for nearly all materials. There are some reported
   structures and materials having negative Poisson's ratio. However, most
   of them are at macroscale, and reentrant structures and rigid rotating
   units are the main mechanisms for their negative Poisson's ratio
   behavior. Here, with numerical and theoretical evidence, we show that
   metal {[}100] nanowires with asymmetric cross-sections such as rectangle
   or ellipse can exhibit negative Poisson's ratio behavior. Furthermore,
   the negative Poisson's ratio behavior can be further improved by
   introducing a hole inside the asymmetric nanowires. We show that the
   surface effect inducing the asymmetric stresses inside the nanowires is
   a main origin of the superior property.}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{The concept of mechanical metamaterials has become increasingly popular,
   since their macro-scale characteristics can be designed to exhibit
   unusual combinations of mechanical properties on the micro-scale. The
   advances in additive manufacturing (AM, three-dimensional printing)
   techniques have boosted the fabrication of these mechanical
   metamaterials by facilitating a precise control over their
   micro-architecture. Although mechanical metamaterials with negative
   Poisson's ratios (i.e., auxetic metamaterials) have received much
   attention before and have been reviewed multiple times, no comparable
   review exists for architected materials with positive Poisson's ratios.
   Therefore, this review will focus on the topology-property relationships
   of non-auxetic mechanical metamaterials in general and five topological
   designs in particular. These include the designs based on the diamond,
   cube, truncated cube, rhombic dodecahedron, and the truncated
   cuboctahedron unit cells. We reviewed the mechanical properties and
   fatigue behavior of these architected materials, while considering the
   effects of other factors such as those of the AM process. In addition,
   we systematically analyzed the experimental, computational, and
   analytical data and solutions available in the literature for the
   titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V. Compression dominated lattices, such as the
   (truncated) cube, showed the highest mechanical properties. All of the
   proposed unit cells showed a normalized fatigue strength below that of
   solid titanium (i.e., 40\% of the yield stress), in the range of 12-36\%
   of their yield stress. The unit cells discussed in this review could
   potentially be applied in bone-mimicking porous structures.}},

   Extremal materials can possess interesting properties such as a negative

   requirement they are manufacturable without any need for

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures exhibit negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and offer
   valuable enhancement of mechanical properties. This study presents a
   combined experimental and numerical investigation of the out-of-plane
   and in-plane performances of a recently proposed auxetic structure,
   re-entrant chiral auxetic (RCA), under quasi-static uniaxial
   compression. The popular hexagonal honeycomb and re-entrant honeycomb
   were also studied as benchmarks for comparison. Specimens were
   fabricated by fused deposition modelling (FDM) process. It was found
   that printing quality depends on the size and complexity of the printed
   structures. Deformation mode, stress-strain curves and energy absorption
   of the three types of structure were studied and compared. Specific
   energy absorption per unit volume, W-nu and per unit mass, SEA, were
   calculated up to the strain at the onset of densification. Results show
   that the out-of-plane energy absorption of the proposed structure
   outperformed that of the other two benchmarks. In contrast, when
   comparing the energy-absorbing efficiency, the hexagonal honeycomb
   revealed the highest energy absorption efficiency of 65\%, compared with
   44\% and 52\% for the re-entrant and the proposed RCA structure,
   respectively. For the in-plane compression, the proposed structure
   exhibited a negative Poisson's ratio and demonstrated anisotropic

Abstract = {{Most materials exhibit positive Poisson's ratio (PR) values, but special
   structures can also present negative and, even rarer, zero (or close to
   zero) PR. Null PR structures have received much attention due to their
   unusual properties and potential applications in different fields, such
   as aeronautics and bioengineering. Herein, a new and simple near-zero PR
   2D topological model is presented based on a structural block composed
   of two smooth and rigid bars connected by a soft membrane or spring. It
   is not based on reentrant or honeycomb-like configurations, which have
   been the basis of many null or quasinull PR models. The topological
   model is 3D printed, and the experimentally obtained PR is -0.003 +/-
   0.001 which is one of the closest to zero values ever reported. The
   possibility to extend this model to 3D systems with compression in any
   direction is discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of these models
   are also addressed.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of elevated temperature and solvent exposure on the

   their auxetic characteristics. It is also shown that such changes do not
   occur if the foams are subjected to the high temperature or solvent
   exposure in a contained state which does not permit the expansion. This
   means that auxetic foams can still be used in such environments provided

Abstract = {{Exploiting the unique properties of three-dimensional (3D) auxetic
   scaffolds in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications
   provides new impetus to these fields. Herein, the results on the
   fabrication and characterization of 3D auxetic scaffolds for tissue
   engineering applications are presented. The scaffolds are based on the
   well-known re-entrant hexagonal geometry (bowtie) and they are
   fabricated by multiphoton lithography using the organic-inorganic
   photopolymer SZ2080. In situ scanning electron
   microscopy-microindentations and nanoindention experiments are employed
   to characterize the photocurable resin SZ2080 and the scaffolds
   fabricated with it. Despite SZ2080 being a stiff material with a
   positive Poisson's ratio, the scaffolds exhibit a negative Poisson's
   ratio and high elasticity due to their architecture. Next, mouse
   fibroblasts are used to seed the scaffolds, showing that they can
   readily penetrate them and proliferate in them, adapting the scaffold
   shape to suit the cells' requirements. Moreover, the scaffold
   architecture provides the cells with a predilection to specific
   directions, an imperative parameter for regenerative medicine in many
   cell-based applications. This research paves the way for the utility of
   3D auxetic metamaterials as the next-generation adaptable scaffolds for

Abstract = {{We have examined the effect of temperature, pressure, and time on the
   magnitude of induced auxetic response in post-manufacture-processed
   needle-punched nonwovens. Different combinations of these processing
   parameters - temperatures ranging from room temperature to above the
   glass transition temperature (T-g) of constituent fibers, pressure of
   0.49 or 2.45 MPa, and duration of 4 or 24 h - were used to process these
   nonwovens. This resulted in some permanent compression (defined as
   ``compression set{''}) and in out-of-plane auxetic behavior of the
   fabric, both of which were found to be proportional to the severity of
   the processing conditions employed. Milder processing conditions were
   found to be insufficient in producing significant compression set and
   hence produced little or no auxetic response. Using micro-CT and optical
   video microscopy techniques, it was found that the processing conditions
   caused the fiber bundles present in needle-punched nonwovens to assume a
   buckled/tilted state, which opened up during mechanical extension and
   hence were instrumental in the observed thickness increase. (C) 2016

   lattice structures with negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA \& ASTRONOMICA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{5}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies the static mechanical properties of four-sided
   concave pyramid-type lattice structures with a polyurea coating and a
   negative Poisson's ratio. Experimental models of different types were
   made by the additive manufacturing method. Quasi-static compression
   experiments of lattice structures, and three-point and four-point
   bending experiments of lattice sandwich structures, were implemented.
   The lattice structure exhibited a significantly negative Poisson's ratio
   effect under compressive load. Under platform stresses of 0.6-1.0 MPa,
   the polyurea coating obviously improved the mechanical properties of the
   lattice structures. The total energy absorption, deformation energy per
   unit volume, and specific energy absorption were significantly higher
   (by 1-2 orders of magnitude) in the multicellular polyurea-coated models
   than in the uncoated models. The maximum energy-absorption efficiency
   and compression utilization in the polyurea-coated models reached
   40.59\% and 55.15\%, respectively. In the lattice structures without
   polyurea, the deformation energy per unit volume, specific energy
   absorption, maximum energy-absorption efficiency, and compression
   utilization decreased with increasing number of units. These trends are
   attributable to early brittle fracture. Meanwhile, the energy-absorption
   characteristics of the polyurea-coated lattice structures largely
   depended on the polyurea thickness. Under a bending load, the
   polyurea-uncoated lattice sandwich structures were prone to partial core
   collapse, especially around the indenter. The destruction degree reduced
   layer by layer outward to the core. The upper and lower panels showed
   fold-line deformation and a curved deformation mode, respectively. The
   upper panel developed a ``U-shaped{''} deformation mode at an early
   stage, and its core failure range was widely reduced. The lower panel
   was 19.61\%-42.03\% more deformed in the polyurea-coated than in the
   uncoated lattice sandwich structures. The results provide a reference
   for the design of lightweight and efficient energy-absorptive structures
   for ship protection.}},

Abstract = {{The auxetic meta-material is a special class of macro-structure designed
   for exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio. The spatial repetition of the
   lattice affects the wave propagation and dynamic responses. In this
   study, a mathematical basis of Bloch analysis for auxetic media have
   been presented and shaded some important light on the application of the
   technique. For this design an analysis has been carried out to show how
   the periodic boundary condition changes with the connectivity,
   orientation and geometry of unit lattice. The corresponding eigen value
   problem is developed to obtain the propagation frequency which is the
   function of mass, stiffness matrix and the wave vector. Mapping of
   different forms which are associated with the nodal displacements of a
   unit cell to adjacent cell have been demonstrated and formulated
   mathematically and observed its effect on the reduced stiffness and mass
   matrices is studied. Modal analysis has been carried out using Abaqus
   6.14 and the transverse nodal displacements obtained from the F.E
   analysis. The Bloch formulation for revolving-square type auxetic
   structure has been formulated and validated. Further, we have obtained
   the changes in auxetic behavior of the structure under different
   boundary conditions. The periodicity of a given lattice assists in
   determining the frequency bands within which the propagation of elastic
   waves is permitted. Further study is proposed for attenuation and
   transmission band analysis to steer the waves which roots the idea of
   vibration sink, in which we can damp the mechanical waves effectively at
   a specific location. The Auxetic meta-materials is envisaged to have a
   significant role in wave attenuation and wave steering, and can be used
   effectively for vibration control.}},

   structure extend outward from the mid; NPR structures with small number
   of layers and cells will make some layers of structures rotate in final
   crushing state. If the thickness of the long-inclined bean (L-beam) is
   larger than that of short-inclined beam (S-beam), there will be a
   smoother transition from the lower to a higher value in crushing force.
   Conversely, the force will maintain a relatively steady value, which
   determined by the sum of the thickness of L- and S-beams. In addition,
   there is also a critical inner circle radius which distinguishes
   different deformation modes. Once the critical inner circle radius is
   smaller than the critical value, NPR structures tend to deform
   unsteadily.}},

Abstract = {{Four-dimensional (4D) printing, integrates transformation information
   into three-dimensional (3D)-printed structures, which means that
   3D-printed structures are able to change their shapes, properties, or
   functionalities over time. Here, two types of shape memory personalized
   vascular stents with negative Poisson's ratio structure are developed
   via 4D printing. The genetic algorithm is used to optimize the
   structure. Axial compression tests, radial compression tests and
   three-point bending tests are carried out to study the mechanical
   properties of the stents. In addition, fluid-structure interaction and
   stress distribution during the shape recovery process are investigated
   based on finite element method. The shape memory behaviors of the stents
   are excellent and in vitro feasibility tests demonstrate that the stents
   can expand the simulated narrow blood vessel rapidly. Therefore, 4D
   printed shape memory stents with negative Poisson's ratio structure are
   highly promising for the treatment of vascular stenosis.}},

Abstract = {{Using both mathematical and numerical methods, the optimal distributions
   of material characterized by the Young modulus and Poisson ratio (as
   well as other moduli of isotropy) maximizing the overall stiffness of an
   inhomogeneous isotropic elastic 3D body transmitting a given surface
   loading to a given support are constructed. The overall stiffness of the
   body is defined as the inverse of the work of external forces on
   displacements, called here the compliance of the structure. The
   isoperimetric condition bounds the integral of the trace of the Hooke
   tensor. It is proved that isotropic composite materials forming the
   bodies of extremely high stiffness exhibit negative Poisson ratio in
   large subdomains, which points at the significance of the auxetic
   material in modern structural design. The obtained results show that the
   whole range of possible variation of the Poisson ratio is used, from -1
   to 1/2, which proves usefulness of the auxetic materials. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Currently, auxetic yarns consisting of a core filament and a wrap
   filament are generally utilized as complex materials, which are
   attributed to residual torque. Thus, the main content dealt with in this
   paper was to analyze the structure formation and effect of heat
   treatment of helical auxetic complex yarn spun by a modified
   ring-spinning system. Firstly, an orthogonal experiment with three
   factors and three levels was carried out to study the effects of
   diameter ratio, yarn twists and initial helical angle on the structure
   and Poisson's ratio of complex yarn. Secondly, a heat treatment process
   with polyamide filament with low melting point (80celcius) was conducted
   to improve the structural stability of auxetic complex yarn. It was
   found that the heat treatment process can not only improve the
   structural stability of complex yarn, but also promote the expansion
   effect. By comparing experimental and theoretical results, it was found
   that the variation of Poisson's ratio with axial strain had good
   consistency. Therefore, the heat treatment method can effectively solve
   the slippage problem of helical auxetic complex yarn.}},

Title = {{An Enhanced Three-Dimensional Auxetic Lattice Structure with Improved
   Property}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{In order to enhance the mechanical property of auxetic lattice
   structures, a new enhanced auxetic lattice structure was designed by
   embedding narrow struts into a three-dimensional (3D) re-entrant lattice
   structure. A series of enhanced lattice structures with varied
   parameters were fabricated by 3D printing combined with the molten metal
   infiltration technique. Based on the method, parameter studies were
   performed. The enhanced auxetic lattice structure was found to exhibit
   superior mechanical behaviors compared to the 3D re-entrant lattice
   structure. An interesting phenomenon showed that increasing the diameter
   of connecting struts led to less auxetic and non-auxetic structures.
   Moreover, the compressive property of the enhanced structure also
   exhibited obvious dependence on the base material and compression
   directions. The present study can provide useful information for the
   design, fabrication and application of new auxetic structures with
   enhanced properties.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have seen a consistent trend in the extension of 2D auxetic
   models towards 3D ones. This article introduces a 3D auxetic linkage
   structure by extending the double arrowhead honeycomb structure to an
   intersecting double arrowhead structure. A geometrical analysis on the
   basis of rigid linkages with rotational joints shows that auxeticity is
   manifested in all three orthogonal planes. Results reveal that the
   geometry, in terms of either the relative linkage lengths or the half
   angles, can be changed to substantially control the Poisson's ratio. It
   is herein suggested that functionally graded beams and plates that
   exhibit gradual change in Poisson's ratio from negative to positive, as
   well as functionally graded solids with opposing auxeticity trends on
   different planes, are easily achievable by 3D printing using the
   intersecting double arrowhead structure, and that further mechanistic
   analysis be performed. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube reinforced composite (CNTRC) is one of the novel classes
   of advanced composite materials. This paper investigates the nonlinear
   bending and nonlinear vibration responses of hybrid laminated beams made
   of CNTRC layers bonded with metal layers on the top and bottom surfaces.
   We proposed a hybrid metal/CNTRC laminated beam for which out-of-plane
   Poisson's ratio is negative. The effective material properties of CNTRC
   layers are graded in a piece-wise pattern across the thickness of the
   beam. The material properties of both CNTRC layer and metal layer are
   temperature dependent. The beams are rested on an elastic foundation and
   are located in thermal environments. Reddy's higher-order beam model is
   used to establish the motion equations of the hybrid metal/CNTRC
   laminated beam. The motion equations include the von Karman geometric
   nonlinearity, the thermal effects and the beam-foundation interaction.
   By employing a two-step perturbation approach, the bending and nonlinear
   vibration solutions are obtained. A comparison of nonlinear responses of
   hybrid metal/CNTRCl laminated beams with positive and negative Poisson's
   ratios (NPRs) under different thermal environmental conditions is
   carried out and discussed in detail.}},

Title = {{Auxetic Mechanical Metamaterials to Enhance Sensitivity of Stretchable
   Strain Sensors}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{Stretchable strain sensors play a pivotal role in wearable devices, soft
   robotics, and Internet-of-Things, yet these viable applications, which
   require subtle strain detection under various strain, are often limited
   by low sensitivity. This inadequate sensitivity stems from the Poisson
   effect in conventional strain sensors, where stretched elastomer
   substrates expand in the longitudinal direction but compress
   transversely. In stretchable strain sensors, expansion separates the
   active materials and contributes to the sensitivity, while Poisson
   compression squeezes active materials together, and thus intrinsically
   limits the sensitivity. Alternatively, auxetic mechanical metamaterials
   undergo 2D expansion in both directions, due to their negative
   structural Poisson's ratio. Herein, it is demonstrated that such auxetic
   metamaterials can be incorporated into stretchable strain sensors to
   significantly enhance the sensitivity. Compared to conventional sensors,
   the sensitivity is greatly elevated with a 24-fold improvement. This
   sensitivity enhancement is due to the synergistic effect of reduced
   structural Poisson's ratio and strain concentration. Furthermore,
   microcracks are elongated as an underlying mechanism, verified by both
   experiments and numerical simulations. This strategy of employing
   auxetic metamaterials can be further applied to other stretchable strain
   sensors with different constituent materials. Moreover, it paves the way
   for utilizing mechanical metamaterials into a broader library of
   stretchable electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Polyurethane foam was fabricated by `two-component method' for changing
   cell structures. Compression force applied immediately to the
   polyurethane foam just after complete foam formation at the top of the
   mold for generation cell structure of negative Poisson effect. That is
   what we called pressure-controlled method. The polyurethane foam,
   produced by pressure-control method (CT), has significant higher
   resilience (52.3\%) and similar level of shock absorption (47.5\%)
   compared with control polyurethane foam (resilience is 21.5\%, shock
   absorption is 54\%). The PU foam with negative Poisson's ratio showed
   excellent resilience with shock absorbance. The pressure-control method
   divided into two parts (CT0, CT1). The CT1 method is to apply
   compression force to the foam with time-delayed after foam formation.
   The PU foam produced by CT1 showed lower stress relaxation time, stress
   relaxation ratio, and maximum stress than CTO. Hence, CT1 foam is
   superior to other polyurethane foam as shock absorbing materials, such
   as shoes for diabetic patients.}},

Title = {{Auxetic behavior of Beishan granite after thermal treatment: A
   microcracking perspective}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{231}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Majority of minerals or rocks commonly display a positive Poisson's
   ratio between 0.05 and 0.45. However, granites that experience high
   temperature treatment can exhibit negative Poisson's ratio under low
   compressive stresses. The underlying mechanism responsible for the
   auxetic behavior of thermally-treated granites is poorly understood.
   Here we present experimental results of uniaxial compression tests on
   thermally-treated Beishan granite, which show auxetic behavior with
   increasing thermal treatment temperature and the Poisson's ratio is as
   low as -0.18 for a maximum thermal treatment temperature of 650 degrees
   C. To reveal the thermally-induced change in the microstructures of
   Beishan granite, particle discrete element models are built and
   calibrated using the experimental data. The numerical results show that
   intensively distributed microcracks appear in the Beishan granite
   specimens after high temperature treatments. The number and the widths
   of microcracks increase with increasing thermal treatment temperature. A
   number of isolated block clusters consisting of mineral grains form due
   to the connection of thermally-induced microcracks under high
   temperature thermal treatment. The deformation behavior of these block
   clusters is primarily responsible for the observed negative Poisson's
   ratio of the thermally-treated Beishan granite during compression.}},

Abstract = {{The conventional hood with single material and stiffener structural form
   conceals some limitations on pedestrian protection and lightweight, not
   satisfying the requirements of structural strength, pedestrian
   protection and lightweight contradictory with each other at the same
   time. In this paper, a novel type hood is proposed to develop sandwich
   structure using architected cellular material with negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) configuration based on the decoupling thought of structural
   strength and energy absorption. Core-layer aluminum alloy material with
   NPR is used to meet the requirement of impact energy absorption, inner
   and outer skin using carbon fiber is selected to achieve high structural
   stiffness needed. This paper starts from the relations between geometric
   parameters of core-layer architected cellular material and mechanical
   properties, on this basis, the optimal geometric parameters can be
   expected using the multiobjective optimization method. Eventually, the
   optimal novel hood can be obtained using three layer thicknesses as
   optimization variables, minimum HIC value and minimum mass as
   objectives. It should be noted that global stiffness of the novel hood
   is not less than that of conventional hood, and entire thickness of the
   novel hood is not larger than conventional hood and impact intrusion of
   novel hood is less than safe distance between hood and engine. Based on
   limitations above, optimal layer thicknesses of architected cellular
   structure can be achieved. Then, the novel hood is compared with the
   conventional hood. The results show that the average HIC value of
   corresponding collision points in the novel hood decreases by 45\%. In
   addition, bending stiffness of the novel hood achieved increases by
   33\%, and torsional stiffness increases by 67\%. While the weight is
   reduced, 18.95\% exactly. Thus, the novel hood proposed in this paper
   demonstrates outstanding performance in terms of pedestrian protection,
   structural stiffness enhancement and weight reduction.}},

Pages = {{289-297}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the thermal post-buckling behavior of sandwich
   beams with functionally graded (FG) negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   honeycomb cores. Two symmetric FG configurations of re-entrant honeycomb
   cores along the beam thickness direction are proposed for the first
   time. The material properties of both face sheets and core of the
   sandwich beams are assumed to be temperature-dependent. The thermal
   post-buckling behavior and the variation of effective Poisson's ratio
   (EPR) of the sandwich beam in the large deflection region are studied by
   using 3D full scale finite element simulations. Numerical results are
   presented for the sandwich beams with FG-NPR honeycomb core under a
   uniform temperature field, from which results for the same sandwich beam
   with uniform distributed NPR honeycomb core are obtained as a
   comparator. The EPR-deflection curves are obtained for the first time,
   and the results reveal that greater bending stiffness could bring about
   higher EPR-deflection curve. The effects of functionally graded
   configurations, boundary conditions, facesheet-to-core thickness ratios,
   cell wall-to-facesheet thickness ratios and length-to-thickness ratios
   on the thermal post-buckling load-deflection curves and EPR-deflection
   curves of sandwich beams are discussed in detail.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Negative Poisson's Ratio Polyurethane Scaffolds for
   Articular Cartilage Tissue Engineering Applications}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{An auxetic polyurethane (PU) scaffold was prepared to investigate
   chondrocyte proliferation under compressive stimulation for cartilage
   regeneration. To give a negative Poisson's ratio to the PU scaffold,
   volumetric compression with a 3:1 ratio was applied during heat
   treatment. For the control PU scaffold, the Poisson's ratio was 0.9 +/-
   0.25 with elongation at 20\% of the strain range. Poisson's ratio for
   experimental specimens was approximately -0.4 +/- 0.12 under the same
   conditions. In cell proliferation tests, cells were cultivated within
   the prepared scaffold under compression with a 20\% strain range. With a
   20\% strain range elongation, the compressive load was approximately 0.3
   N. The experimental group showed a 1.3 times higher cellular
   proliferation rate than that of the control group after 3 days in
   culture. At day 5 of culture, however, the rate of proliferation of the
   control group increased so that there was no significant difference
   between groups. However, collagen content (produced by the cells) in the
   cell-proliferated medium was 1.5 times higher in the experimental group
   after 5 days in culture. This may have been due to the effectiveness of
   the auxetic structure of the scaffold. An isotropic compressive load was
   transmitted to the cells due to the negative Poisson ratio of the
   scaffold.}},

   ratio electrode and thin film electrode in Li-ion battery cyclic
   operation}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{150}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the charging/discharging cycle of battery, electrode may
   expand/shrink cyclically and be in an asymmetric behavior of tension and
   compression. Based on this, electrode may undergo elastic deformation
   and inelastic deformation, which can naturally result in the electrode
   ratcheting deformation and capacity fading. In this paper, a new
   analytical model is developed to study the ratcheting deformation of
   thin film electrode and negative Poisson's ratio electrode (hollow
   re-entrant honeycomb shape) in battery cyclic operation. The influence
   of concentration-dependent material properties on electrode ratcheting
   deformation is discussed in detail. By the comparison between thin film
   electrode and negative Poisson's ratio electrode, it is found that the
   stress level in negative Poisson's ratio electrode is relatively low due
   to the faster appearance of the inelastic deformation. Furthermore, the
   structure optimization of negative Poisson's ratio electrode can
   suppress the ratcheting deformation (produce less accumulated
   deformation) in battery operating cycles and increase the battery cycle
   life about 8.1\% when compared with thin film electrode. Our work shows
   that the electrode mechanical degradation is in the form of ratcheting
   deformation when subjected to cyclic loading. The developed analytical
   model of negative Poisson's ratio electrode may help for the electrode
   design and provide a theoretical way to prolong the cycle life of the
   battery.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes the transverse shear properties of a novel
   centresymmetric honeycomb structure evaluated using analytical and
   finite element models. The cellular structure features a representative
   volume element (RVE) geometry allowing in-plane auxetic (negative
   Poisson's ratio) deformations, and multiple topologies to design the
   honeycomb for multifunctional applications. The out-of-plane properties
   are calculated using a theoretical approach based on Voigt and Reuss
   bounds. The analytical models are validated using a full scale Finite
   Element technique to simulate transverse shear tests, a quarter FE of
   the RVE with periodic shear conditions and an FE homogenisation method
   for periodic structures. The comparison between the analytical and
   numerical models shows good convergence between the different set of
   results, and highlights the specific deformation mechanism of the multi
   re-entrant honeycomb cell. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Very recently, a new single-element two-dimensional (2D) material
   borophene was successfully grown on a silver surface under pristine
   ultrahigh vacuum conditions which attracts tremendous interest. In this
   paper, the lattice thermal conductivity, phonon lifetimes, thermal
   expansion and temperature dependent elastic moduli of borophene are
   systematically studied by using first-principles. Our simulations show
   that borophene possesses unique thermal properties. Strong phonon-phonon
   scattering is found in borophene, which results in its unexpectedly low
   lattice thermal conductivity. Thermal expansion coefficients along both
   the armchair and zigzag directions of borophene show impressive negative
   values. More strikingly, the elastic moduli are sizably strengthened as
   temperature increases, and the negative in-plane Poisson's ratios are
   found along both the armchair and zigzag directions at around 120 K. The
   mechanisms of these unique thermal properties are also discussed in this
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{The work describes the manufacturing and testing of graded
   conventional/auxetic honeycomb cores. The graded honeycombs are
   manufactured using Kevlar woven fabric/914 epoxy prepreg using Kirigami
   techniques, which consist in a combination of Origami and ply-cut
   processes. The cores are used to manufacture sandwich panels for
   flatwise compression and edgewise loading. The compressive modulus and
   compressive strength of stabilized (sandwich) honeycombs are found to be
   higher than those of bare honeycombs, and with density-averaged
   properties enhanced compared to other sandwich panels offered in the
   market place. The modulus and strength of graded sandwich panel under
   quasi-static edgewise loading vary with different failure mode
   mechanisms, and offer also improvements towards available panels from
   open literature. Edgewise impact loading shows a strong directionality
   of the mechanical response. When the indenter impacts the auxetic
   portion of the graded core, the strong localization of the damage due to
   the negative Poisson's ratio effect contains significantly the maximum
   dynamic displacement of the sandwich panel. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A systematic investigation is presented that explores band gap
   properties of periodic micro-structures architected for maximum
   auxeticity. The design of two-dimensional auxetic cells is addressed
   using inverse homogenization. A non-convex optimization problem is
   formulated that is solved through mathematical programming. Different
   starting guesses are used to explore local minima when distributing
   material and void or two materials and void. The same numerical tool
   succeeds in capturing re-entrant, chiral and anti-chiral layouts with
   negative Poisson's ratio, retrieving solutions originally found through
   other approaches as well as generating variations. A Floquet-Bloch
   approach is then applied to the achieved periodic cells to investigate
   possible band gaps characterizing the in-plane wave propagation.
   Directional and full band-pass filters are found in the case of
   micro-structures whose auxetic behavior comes from the arising of a
   rotational deformation of the periodic cell. Such kind of topologies
   could be exploited to design tunable wave guides and tunable phononic
   crystals, respectively.}},

Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{98}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic structures with negative Poisson's ratio have been widely
   studied due to their unique mechanical properties, especially the
   dynamic properties under low-velocity impact. In this paper, the dynamic
   properties of an excellent candidate for engineering application, double
   arrowed honeycomb (DAH), are analyzed thoroughly. The deformation
   patterns of the DAH under high and low velocity impact are compared,
   which shows there is a great difference between them. Analytical models
   for predicting the dynamic strength at the crushing/supporting end of
   DAH are developed based on cellular collapse mechanism. It shows that
   the crushing strength rises with the increase of the relative density
   and impact velocity. Numerical simulations are also performed to verify
   the accuracy of the analytical models. It is found that there is good
   agreement between the analytical and numerical predictions for the
   dynamic characteristics. Also, the energy absorptions of the DAH are
   also thoroughly studied based on the analytical models. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{The auxetic structures are structures with negative Poisson ratio that
   behave under tension or compression as opposed to ordinary materials.
   Due to the unique mechanical properties, such as increasing the
   resistance against collision and different formation capability,
   extensive research is ongoing. In this research, using finite element
   modeling, simulation of various geometrical parameters of auxetic cell
   structures have been studied. Verification of the results is done by
   experimental tests of the model made by 3D printing technology. By
   introducing different measurement methods such as image processing, the
   modeling results are compared with experimental tests that show high
   accuracy results. In this analysis, the effect of the angle between the
   cell components, unit cell dimensions, thickness, and density of cells
   are investigated. In addition, new designs to improve the performance of
   the auxetic structure such as the use of different thicknesses are
   studied. Auxetic structures are part of advanced structures such as
   composites and biomaterials with diverse properties and applications in
   various fields such as military, medical, textile, and aerospace
   industries. Auxetic applications are excellent in absorbing impact force
   as bulletproof vests and similar equipment, high strength to weight in
   lightweight sandwich panels, and in tissue engineering like stent

Abstract = {{The nonlinear bending behavior of nanocomposite laminated plates with
   negative Poisson's ratios (NPR) is reported. Each ply of the plate is
   made of carbon nanotube-reinforced composites (CNTRCs) and may have
   different CNT volume fractions and the CNTRC plies are arranged in the
   thickness direction in a piece-wise functionally graded pattern. The
   plate is supposed to be rested on a two-parameter elastic foundation and
   is exposed in a thermal environment. The temperature-dependent material
   properties of the CNTRCs are evaluated using an extended Voigt (rule of
   mixture) model. The governing equations for the nonlinear bending of
   FG-CNTRC laminated plates are based on Reddy's third order shear
   deformation plate theory and solved by using a two-step perturbation
   approach. Analytical solutions are obtained which include the
   geometrical nonlinearity in the von Karman sense, the thermal effects
   and the plate-foundation interaction. The effect of NPR on the nonlinear
   bending responses of FG-CNTRC laminated plates under different loading
   conditions are investigated comparatively according to the graphical
   results. It is explicitly shown that NPR has a significant effect on the
   nonlinear bending responses of CNTRC laminated plates.}},

Abstract = {{The development of smart structures, aimed at optimizing the response of
   engineering systems, is a modern and very promising field. Such advanced
   structural element can be obtained, in some cases, by using the
   so-called auxetic materials, i.e. materials exhibiting negative
   Poisson's ratio. In the present paper a brief introduction on auxetic
   materials and on their use and potentiality is presented. In particular
   their application to obtain smart layered plates is discussed; it is
   shown as these materials allow, in certain conditions, to get a desired
   stiffness and a nearly linear behaviour (even under large displacement
   conditions) of bended plates, without changing the plate's geometry and
   materials. Such potentialities are presented and discussed based on
   numerical analyses, and a mechanical interpretation of the observed
   structural behaviour is proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Special soliton analytical solutions are seeked for the so-called double
   dispersion equation (or Porubov's equation), which describes the
   propagation of longitudinal waves in an elastic rod. Using the
   F-expansion method, a new interesting class of traveling solitary waves
   is obtained. As a byproduct, the results obtained by other authors for
   some special cases are regained. Some numerical simulations are also
   performed. Splitting of various initial pulses during propagation into a
   sequence of solitary waves is considered. The dependence of the
   amplitude and the velocity of the solitary waves on Poisson's ratio is
   discussed in detail. Collisions between some obtained solitary waves are
   also presented. The simulation results are compared with the obtained
   exact analytical solutionsthe latter reflect the perfect balance between
   the nonlinearity and dispersion. The comparison indicates that the
   obtained exact solutions are useful for describing more complicated wave
   fields studied by numerical simulations. It also indicates that the
   numerical results for auxetic materials are in better agreement with
   theoretical solutions than in the case of ordinary materials.
   Furthermore, one can conclude that the Secant pulse generates solitary
   waves closer to the analytical predictions than a Gaussian pulse. This
   is similar to the case of variational method, where the Secant trial
   function is also more proper than the Gaussian one. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH

   method}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{According to the anisotropy and non-homogeneity of composite sandwich
   panels with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), the variational asymptotic
   method combined with multiscale technology (VAMM) is used to analyze its
   effective properties. Firstly, in the microscale, the effective
   properties of the unidirectional fiber reinforced composite (UDFRC)
   forming the facesheets are obtained by means of asymptotic
   homogenization analysis, which can be used as lamina properties. Then,
   in the mesoscale, an asymptotic analysis of the typical unit cell is
   carried out to deduce the effective plate properties (A, B, and D
   matrices) of composite sandwich panels with NPR according to the
   heterogeneity of the structure. Finally, the influence of the layup
   configurations and fiber volume fractions of UDFRC on the equivalent
   plate properties of composite sandwich panels with NPR is analyzed.
   Numerical results show that the 3D responses of composite sandwich
   panels with NPR using VAMM are in agreement with those of 3D FEM model,
   while in a much more efficient manner. The layup configurations of
   facesheets have great influence on the equivalent plate properties of
   the structure. Furthermore, the degree of anisotropy and negative
   Poisson's ratio of the whole structure decrease with increasing fiber
   volume fraction of UDFRC.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) exhibit an unusual
   property of expanding when stretched in the direction normal to an
   applied uniaxial tension and vice versa when compressed, a phenomenon
   which is known to result in many beneficial effects in the performance
   of materials in various practical situations. In particular, it has long
   been suggested that spherical shells made from isotropic materials
   having Poisson's ratio less than -0.5 exhibit enhanced resistance to
   buckling as a result of externally applied normal pressure. This work
   uses finite elements (FEs) modelling to assess the behaviour of various
   spherical, torispherical and ellipsoidal shells when they are subjected
   to external (in all cases) or internal (in the case of torispherical and
   ellipsoidal-shells) pressures. We find that to a first approximation the
   critical buckling pressures scale lineraly with (1 - nu(2))(-1/2) thus
   suggesting that the critical buckling pressures tends to infinity as nu
   tends to -1, this being in accordance to what was known for spherical
   shells. We also find that the Poisson ratio has an effect on the
   amplitude and the number of buckling wavelengths that occur when the
   shells buckle. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

   stiffness of the hybrid auxetic composite support is modelled using an
   analytical and Finite Element approach benchmarked against experimental
   results from three-point bending tests. The benchmarked Finite Element
   models are used to develop a map of optimised static stiffness versus
   the geometry of the rhomboidal perforations. A Design of Experiment
   testing campaign is also carried out on 16 hybrid auxetic composite
   plates to understand the interaction and correlation of the static
   bending versus the geometry of the perforations and the contribution

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{152}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that the Poisson's ratios for 3D isotropic elastic
   materials vary from -1 to +1/2. These results provide reference points
   for comparing the Poisson's ratios of anisotropic elastic materials.
   Sheet crystals (SCs) with remarkably anisotropic structures, in which
   sheet planes do not intersect, have recently attracted major fundamental
   and practical interest, while the bounds on the in-plane Poisson's
   ratios and linear and area compressibilities have not been generically
   established. Based on the theory of elasticity, we here predict the
   fundamental bounds on the inplane Poisson's ratios and linear and area
   compressibilities for SCs of any crystal system. These predictions are
   well supported by a data-driven investigation of numerically generated
   elastic tensors, elastic tensors from first principles calculations for
   both 2D and 3D SCs, and experimentally measured elastic tensors for 3D
   SCs. Based on these findings, the range of 2D and 3D SC materials that
   increase density or planar area or maintain constant density or planar
   area when stretched, and increase a dimension or planar area when
   hydrostatically compressed is established for special applications. This
   work provides fundamental insights and guidelines for the discovery,
   understanding, and applications of SCs having these properties in
   tensile strain and hydrostatic pressure environments.}},

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{145}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper treats energy absorption and crushing characteristics of
   auxetic foam-filled square-section tubes under axial loading condition.
   The influence of auxeticity effect on the structural collapse was
   experimentally investigated to quantify the interaction effect between
   Poisson's ratios of foam (ranging from - 0.31- 0.03) and square tube
   walls under quasi-static and dynamic loadings. The validated computer
   simulation technique was employed to conduct a series of parametric
   study in order to evaluate the influence of tube parameters on the
   energy absorption responses. It is evident that negative Poisson ratio
   effectively influences the crushing response and energy absorption
   capability of auxetic foam-filled square tubes. Moreover, it was found
   that increasing the auxeticity level of foam filler enhances
   crashworthiness performance of foam-filled structures under both
   quasistatic and dynamic loading conditions. The primary outcome of this
   study is a design guideline for the use of auxetic foam in different
   ranges of Poisson's ratio as a core for an energy absorber device where
   impact loading is expected.}},

Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic fabrics are those with a negative Poisson's ratio and have
   received increasing attention in recent years. In our previous study, a
   series of auxetic warp-knitted fabrics were developed based on
   re-entrant geometry and their auxetic effects were experimentally
   investigated. Unlike weft-knitted fabrics, the preparation and
   production process of warp-knitted fabrics are very complicated and time
   consuming. However, finite element (FE) method offers an efficient way
   to simulate and predict their auxetic behavior without conducting the
   manufacturing process and experimental tests. Herein, an FE study of
   auxetic warp-knitted fabric structures is conducted. The FE models are
   established from the geometry of a real fabric and compared with the
   experimental results. It is shown that the variation trends of Poisson's
   ratio agree well between the simulation and experiment. Although
   simulation results are slightly different from the experimental ones, it
   still proves feasible for predicting auxetic effects of auxetic fabrics
   using the FE models. It is expected that this research can offer a
   useful method to model and simulate the deformation behavior of auxetic
   warp-knitted fabrics, providing a guide for the design and development
   of more novel auxetic fabric structures.}},

Abstract = {{Aiming at the problems of a complex structure or poor controllability of
   the existing bearing preload control devices, a method of
   self-regulation via a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) spacer is proposed.
   Firstly, the principle of preload automatic adjustment at the bearing
   operation was introduced and the NPRs with three types of cell
   structures were analyzed. Furthermore, a thermo-mechanical coupling
   analysis model of the NPR spacer was established and the deformation and
   force output characteristics of the NPR spacer were studied and
   experimentally verified. It is found that the concave hexagonal cell
   structure has the optimal deformation characteristics for bearing
   preload adjustment. When the temperature is considered, the absolute
   value of Poisson's ratio of the NPR spacer decreases as the speed
   increases and the elongation of the NPR spacer and the output forces are
   much larger than those without temperature consideration. With the
   increase in temperature or rotating speed, the axial elongation and
   output forces of the NPR spacer increases while the effect of
   temperature is relatively larger.}},

Volume = {{33}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Thin elastic sheets and membranes are known to wrinkle when they are
   stretched - the associated physics is highly non-linear. The unusual
   behavior exhibited by thin films upon stretching when they possess
   auxetic structure, i.e. when their apparent Poisson's ratio is negative,
   is reported here. Wrinkling is now suppressed within the bulk of auxetic
   films when tensioned, whereas localized creases confined to the clamps,
   which decay away exponentially, appear. These edge wrinkles are
   characterized for their amplitude and wavelength experimentally,
   theoretically, and computationally, which show excellent agreement with
   expected trends. The scaling for amplitude, wavelength and decay rate
   upon film properties and tension is obtained using simple analyses based
   on kinematic mismatch resulting from lateral Poisson's expansion. (C)

Abstract = {{Adding programmable function to elastic metamaterials makes them
   versatile and intelligent. The objective of this study is to design and
   demonstrate thermomechanically tunable metamaterials with a compliant
   porous structure (CPS) and to analyze their thermomechanical behaviors.
   CPS, the unit cell of the metamaterial, is composed of rectangular
   holes, slits, and bimaterial hinges. By decomposing kinematic rotation
   of a linked arm and elastic deformation of a bimaterial hinge, a
   thermomechanical constitutive model of CPS is constructed, and the
   constitutive model is extended to a three-dimensional (3D) polyhedron
   structure for securing isotropic thermal properties.
   Temperature-dependent properties of base materials are implemented to
   the analytical model. The analytical model is verified with finite
   element (FE) based numerical simulations. A controllable range of
   temperature and strain is identified that is associated with a thermal
   deformation of the bimaterial hinge and contact on the slit surfaces of
   CPS. We also investigate the effect of geometry of CPS on the thermal
   expansion and effective stiffness of the metamaterial. The metamaterial
   with CPS has multiple transformation modes in response to temperature
   while keeping the same mechanical properties at room temperature, such
   as effective moduli and Poisson's ratios. This work will pave the road
   toward the design of programmable metamaterials with both mechanically
   and thermally tunable capability, providing unique thermomechanical
   properties with a programmable function.}},

Abstract = {{A general analytic solution has been obtained to effective Poisson ratio
   and Young's modulus of an isotropic two-phase disordered composite
   composed of an incompressible matrix and elliptic or ellipsoidal
   inclusions, each having a Poisson ratio of -1, in the mean-field
   approximation, which yields a further result that as long as the
   inclusion area or volume fraction exceeds 0.33, 0.83, 0.42. 0.61 and
   0.85 for nearly disc-, blade-, sphere-, disk- and neddle-like
   inclusions, respectively, it is always possible to make the resulting
   composite auxetic. Analytic expansions of the effective elastic moduli
   in the parameters characterizing a small deviation of inclusion shapes
   from blades or disks or needles have been developed, giving good
   approximations when truncated at second order. Similar analytic
   expansions to fifth order of the depolarizing or demagnetizing factors
   have also been presented. For a matrix having a non-negative Poisson
   ratio, it is found that auxeticity windows exist only for auxetic
   inclusions, and a maximum effective Young's modulus occurs at a certain
   value of volume fraction of auxetic inclusions that are not far from
   blade- or disk- or needle-like. This maximum-Young's-modulus effect may
   be advantageously used to produce technologically important
   high-strength auxetic composites as in the case of nearly disc-like or
   spherical inclusions studied before. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{187}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this work, through the use of a theoretical model and experimental
   testing, we investigate a novel three-dimensional mechanical
   metamaterial composed of structural units consisting of two
   arrowhead-like elements with magnetic inclusions. We show that such
   system has a capability to exhibit negative Poisson's ratio and negative
   incremental stiffness at the same time. We also show that both the type
   of the stiffness exhibited by the system and its magnitude can be solely
   controlled via the orientation of magnetic inclusions within the
   structure and the magnitude of the magnetic moment associated with
   magnetic inclusions respectively. More specifically, for a particular
   example of magnetic inclusions used in the experiment, the stiffness
   could assume an arbitrary value from the range approximately between -5
   kN/m and 5 kN/m depending on the stage of the mechanical deformation and
   aforementioned factors. This range can be also conveniently adjusted
   depending on the size and properties of magnetic inclusions. This in
   turn allows to adjust mechanical response of the considered structure in
   accordance to a particular application without a need of reconstructing
   the system which would not normally be possible for conventional
   nonmagnetic systems attributing negative stiffness to their elastic
   properties. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{As a kind of mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR), auxetic lattices possess unusual mechanical responses such as
   higher sensitivity to strain and reversibility after large deformation.
   Therefore, they are regarded as a potential candidate to sensors,
   actuators, and optics. Here, we designed four types of auxetic lattices
   with long stress plateau based on the assembly of hollow shell
   cuboctahedron. To begin with, experiments along with finite element
   simulations were performed to probe their auxetic behaviors under
   uniaxial compression, which give an excellent qualitative and
   quantitative agreement. To establish design criteria on specific
   applications, we systematically investigated the mechanical properties
   of the four kinds of lattices with different volume fractions, including
   critical stresses, strain-stress curves, strain energy densities,
   strain-dependent Poisson's ratios, and the length of stress plateau. The
   results demonstrate that these lattices can suffer from buckling with
   NPR in an extended range of volume fractions, and high reversibility was
   observed in several compressive loadings, which provides insight into
   energy absorption such as the body protection equipments and smart
   packaging material}},

Abstract = {{In this work we present a detailed study on the magnetostrictive
   contribution to Poisson ratio for samples under applied mechanical
   stress. Magnetic contributions to strain and Poisson ratio for cubic
   materials were derived by accounting elastic and magneto-elastic
   anisotropy contributions. We apply our theoretical results for a
   material of interest in magnetomechanics, namely, galfenol (Fe1-xGax).
   Our results show that there is a non-negligible magnetic contribution in
   the linear portion of the curve of stress versus strain. The rotation of
   the magnetization towards {[}110] crystallographic direction upon
   application of mechanical stress leads to an auxetic behavior, i.e.,
   exhibiting Poisson ratio with negative values. This magnetic
   contribution to auxetic behavior provides a novel insight for the
   discussion of theoretical and experimental developments of materials
   that display unusual mechanical properties. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic properties of fcc phases of soft polydisperse spheres,
   interacting through inverse-power pair potentials u(r) similar to r(-n),
   where r is the distance between sphere centers, have been studied by
   Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in the NpT ensemble with variable shape of
   the box. The simulations show that both the size polydispersity delta
   and temperature T strongly influence the elastic properties of the
   studied system, including Poisson's ratio. Poisson's ratio is found to
   be negative and decreases with increase of temperature and size
   polydispersity in the {[}110]{[}1 (1) over bar0] direction. Hence, the
   system is partially auxetic. Additionally, the obtained results indicate
   that wide range of Poisson's ratio values (from.{[}110]{[}1 (1) over
   bar0] approximate to -0.3 to.{[}110]{[}001] approximate to 1.1) can be

Abstract = {{The elastic properties of a zeolitic metal-azolate framework, Zn(mtz) 2
   (MAF-7, mtz = 3-methyl- 1,2,4-triazolate), have been examined from the
   view point of the first principles calculations and experiments. Our
   results demonstrate that the three independent elastic constants of
   MAF-7 are about 5.0-73.3\% higher than those of ZIF-8, though they are
   isomorphic. The electron-donating effect of the nitrogen atom at the
   2-position in mtz-ring dominantly accounts for such a prominent
   difference. The detailed analysis of the full elastic tensors reveals
   that the volume moduli, shear moduli, and Poisson's ratios of MAF-7 are
   about 3.4\% to 20.1\%, 3.2\% to 20.6\%, and 30.3\% to 12.3\% higher than
   those of ZIF-8. The underlying structural reasons were discussed to
   explain the anisotropic difference of those properties. Moreover, the
   conclusion deduced from first-principle calculations was also been
   verified by nanoindentation and high-pressure synchrotron X-ray
   diffraction measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio in materials is governed by the following aspects of the
   microstructure: the presence of rotational degrees of freedom,
   non-affine deformation kinematics, or anisotropic structure. Several
   structural models are examined. The non-affine kinematics are seen to be
   essential for the production of negative Poisson's ratios for isotropic
   materials containing central force linkages of positive stiffness.
   Non-central forces combined with pre-load can also give rise to a
   negative Poisson's ratio in isotropic materials. A chiral microstructure
   with non-central force interaction or non-affine deformation can also
   exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. Toughness and damage resistance in
   these materials may be affected by the Poisson's ratio itself, as well
   as by generalized continuum aspects associated with the microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{Featured Application
   A potential application of this work is in the manufacture of energy
   absorbing, light-weight structures such as crash protection safety wear.
   The mechanical response of steel auxetic structures manufactured using
   laser-powder bed fusion was explored. The level of control exerted by
   the key design parameters of vertical strut length (H), re-entrant strut
   length (L), strut thickness (t) and re-entrant angle (theta) on the
   mechanical response was examined through a design of experiment approach
   with ANOVA statistical analysis methods applied. The elastic modulus in
   directions normal to (E-x) and parallel to (E-y) the vertical strut was
   found to be primarily dependent upon t and L, respectively, whereas
   yield strength in both test directions (sigma(x) and sigma(y)) was
   strongly dependent on t and L. A large variation in modulus was found
   between the two test directions (E-x / E-y - 1.02 +/- 0.07 GPa/ 4.4 +/-
   0.1 GPa), whereas, yield strength showed little anisotropy (sigma(x) /
   sigma(y)-45 +/- 6 MPa/ 45 +/- 9 MPa). Poisson's ratio parallel to the
   vertical strut varied considerably with geometry but not in a direction
   normal to the vertical strut. Deformation mechanisms were found to be
   different of compression in the x and y directions, being a combination
   of stretching of the vertical strut; compression, bending and hinging of
   the re-entrant strut (x); and vertical strut compression and re-entrant
   strut stretching and bending (y).}},

Abstract = {{In order to efficiently evaluate and design honeycomb structures with
   excellent energy-absorbing ability, inplane dynamic response and
   multi-objective optimization of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) honeycomb
   structures with sinusoidal curve are performed in this work. By
   establishing the in-plane impact finite element model, the deformation
   modes and in-plane dynamic responses of the sinusoidal NPR honeycomb
   structures under different impact velocities are detailed studied. And
   the geometric parameters (e.g., the amplitude and period) of the
   sinusoidal curve that affect the energy absorption performance of the
   structure are analyzed. Combining the optimal latin hypercube design
   method with the double-points infilling criterion, the highprecision
   adaptive Kriging models of the peak crush force (PCF) and the specific
   energy absorption (SEA) with respect to the amplitude and period are
   constructed. And then, a multi-objective crashworthiness optimization is
   carried out by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The
   Pareto optimal solution set is gained and the final compromise solution
   is then obtained based on the fitness function. The optimized results
   show the PCF of the sinusoidal NPR honeycomb structure decreases by
   30.53\%, while the SEA increases by 38.55\%. It indicates that the
   optimized sinusoidal honeycomb structure has better energy absorption
   performance than the conventional concave hexagonal honeycomb. The
   results can provide some important design guidance for other honeycomb
   energy-absorbing structures.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic mechanical metamaterials exhibit unusual frequency contingent
   properties like negative mass, negative Young's modulus, and negative
   Poisson's ratio in a particular band of the excitation frequency.
   Locally resonant units in the designed metamaterial enable bandgap
   formation virtually at any frequency for wavelengths much higher than
   the lattice length of the unit. Due to out of phase motion of multiple
   resonating units with lattice, there is a change in the dynamic
   properties (stiffness or mass or density) of the material as these
   properties become frequency-dependent. On another side, at higher
   frequencies for wavelengths equal to the lattice size of the medium, the
   Bragg scattering phenomenon occurs, which also helps in the bandgap
   formation. Therefore, these extreme frequency contingent physical
   properties modulate wave propagation through designed metamaterials. In
   this research, the band structure of piezo-embedded negative stiffness
   metamaterial is derived using generalized Bloch theorem. Bloch theorem
   is used to solve various periodic media problems in different fields.
   The relationship between frequency and wave number can be established
   using this theory. The results elucidate that the insertion of the
   piezoelectric material in the resonating unit can provide not only
   better tunability but also several unusual band structures that can be
   perceived. The attenuation bandwidth of the designed metamaterial can be
   tailored through critical parameters derived from the extensive
   non-dimensional study of the system. This research can be considered as
   a contribution towards designing the active elastic mechanical
   metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the in-plane mechanical properties of auxetic structures
   subjected to dynamic compression have been investigated experimentally
   and numerically. The studied auxetic structures, which have negative
   Poisson's ratios, include a recently developed auxetic structure named
   re-entrant chiral auxetic (RCA) structure, re-entrant honeycomb,
   tetrachiral honeycomb and anti-tetrachiral honeycomb. All structures
   studied were fabricated from polyamide12 (PA12) powder using multi jet
   fusion. Compressive tests were conducted at a constant crushing velocity
   of 5 m s(-1) on an Instron VHS 8800 high speed testing machine. The
   experimental results showed that the RCA structure crushed in the Y
   direction offered better energy absorption capacity than the other three
   types of honeycomb. It was also found that loading direction had a
   significant influence on deformation modes and auxetic features of the
   RCA structure, while it had a moderate influence on the energy
   absorption capacity. Numerical models were developed using
   ABAQUS/explicit and verified by experimental results. Parametric study
   was conducted to investigate the effects of crushing velocity and
   geometrical parameters on the dynamic performance of the RCA structure.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamics of periodic structures has fascinated researchers for decades.
   Metamaterials are one of the exemplars of these periodic structures.
   Spatial periodicity of mechanical unit cells in artificially engineered
   metamaterials exhibits idiosyncratic physical properties like negative
   mass, negative Young's modulus, and negative Poisson's ratio. These
   extreme physical properties are beyond the properties found in the
   natural materials. This exceptional dynamic behaviour is frequency
   dependent, which in turn forms the attenuation and transmission band
   during wave transmission through these metamaterials. The frequency
   ranges in which a wave can transmit or attenuate along the length of the
   metamaterial are known as transmission and attenuation bands
   respectively. In this work, the band structure of piezo-embedded
   negative mass metamaterial is analysed using generalized Bloch theorem.
   The addition of the piezoelectric material at the resonating unit
   increases the damping and complexity of the solution. Bloch theorem is
   used to solve several periodic media and using this theory, the
   relationship between frequency and wavenumber can be established.
   Implementation of Bloch theorem has not been reported yet in the context
   of the piezo embedded mass-in-mass metamaterial. Therefore, wave
   propagation through finite units is studied through band structure. In
   addition, voltage and power produced by piezoelectric material are
   estimated. This research can be considered as the first step towards
   modelling an active metamaterial.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure has outstanding performances in
   lightweight and energy absorption, and it can be widely applied in
   automotive industries. By combining the front anti-collision beam, crash
   box and NPR structure, a novel NPR bumper system for improving the
   crashworthiness is first proposed in the work. The performances of the
   NPR bumper system are detailed studied by comparing to traditional
   bumper system and aluminum foam filled bumper system. To achieve the
   rapid design while considering perturbation induced by parameter
   uncertainties, a multi-objective robust design optimization method of
   the NPR bumper system is also proposed. The parametric model of the
   bumper system is constructed by combining the full parametric model of
   the traditional bumper system and the parametric model of the NPR
   structure. Optimal Latin hypercube sampling technique and dual response
   surface method are combined to construct the surrogate models. The
   multi-objective robust optimization results of the NPR bumper system are
   then obtained by applying the multi-objective particle swarm
   optimization algorithm and six sigma criteria. The results yielded from
   the optimizations indicate that the energy absorption capacity is
   improved significantly by the NPR bumper system and its performances are
   further optimized efficiently by the multi-objective robust design
   optimization method.}},

Abstract = {{A novel auxetic metamaterial which is organized in the lattice is
   presented in this paper. Dynamic uniaxial impact behavior of the auxetic
   lattice using experiment and finite element simulation is investigated.
   The corresponding results have proved that the plastic beam-based finite
   element model has good agreement with the experiment. To explore the
   rate sensitivity of the auxetic lattice metamaterial, impact simulations
   of auxetic metamaterials at 13.07\% relative density are firstly
   conducted under six velocities range from 1 to 100m/s. The comparison of
   deformation exhibits that deformation pattern depends on impact
   velocities. The shock wave effect can be obviously observed in the
   impact procedure which results in the loss of negative Poisson's ratio
   effect at high velocity. The effective impact indices including plateau
   stress and densification strain can be extracted from the stress-strain
   curves. The simplified theory model based on the rigid,
   perfectly-plastic, locking model is utilized to fit data from the
   simulation. Furthermore, the effect of relative density on impact
   mechanical properties is investigated. The basic theoretical model is
   developed by considering the relative density which accords with
   simulation data well in four relative densities respectively 7.35\%,
   13.07\%, 20.42\%, 29.41\%. Finally, the formula of plateau stress with
   respect to impact velocity and relative density can be obtained. The
   researches herein are aiming to reveal the dynamic properties of the
   auxetic lattice metamaterial and provide a constitutive model for
   potential application.}},

Abstract = {{In the current work, we elaborate two-dimensional metamaterials of
   controlled anisotropy. To that scope, we employ diamond and
   octagon-shaped planar lattices with and without inner links. Using a
   dedicated homogenization technique, we derive closed-form expressions
   for the lattice's effective mechanical properties. We analyse the effect
   of the lattice's configuration on the metamaterial's effective static
   properties, identifying configurations with mechanical attributes
   desirable for morphing, biomedical and mechanical engineering
   applications. We thereafter compute the lattice's wave propagation
   characteristics, deriving a link between the metamaterials' static and
   dynamic properties. In particular, we analyse the longitudinal and shear
   wave phase velocity dependence on the lattice's geometric configuration.
   Thereupon, we identify architectural arrangements for which the phase
   velocity vanishes in certain propagation directions, exhibiting wave
   propagation isolation characteristics. We demonstrate that the detected
   isolation features can systematically arise for lattice architectural
   designs that yield highly anisotropic static properties (thus high
   material moduli ratios) and anti-auxetic material behaviours (thus
   non-negative Poisson's ratio values). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we constructed a new honeycomb by replacing the
   three-edge joint of the conventional regular hexagonal honeycomb with a
   hollow-cylindrical joint, and developed a corresponding theory to study
   its mechanical properties, i.e., Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio,
   fracture strength and stress intensity factor. Interestingly, with
   respect to the conventional regular hexagonal honeycomb, its Young's
   modulus and fracture strength are improved by 76\% and 303\%,
   respectively; whereas, for its stress intensity factor, two
   possibilities exist for the maximal improvements which are dependent of
   its relative density, and the two improvements are 366\% for low-density
   case and 195\% for high-density case, respectively. Moreover, a minimal
   Poisson's ratio exists. The present structure and theory could be used
   to design new honeycomb materials. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials possess negative Poisson's ratios. As such, they can
   be applied in situations where traditional materials perform poorly or
   cannot perform. We investigate the plastic failure of a 3D auxetic strut
   lattice under uniaxial and transverse loads in order to complement
   ongoing research in miniaturized strut-based sandwich cores. The chosen
   lattice is also representative of an auxetic foam. Plastic failure
   models derived with respect to two physical parameters (packing
   parameter and relative density) which control the negative Poisson's
   ratio compare well with numerical data. Microscopic failure modes differ
   depending on the loading state: shear failure is due to global plastic
   yielding while plastic localization occurs under uniaxial loads. This
   observation suggests among others that it is advisable to use auxetic
   cores when structural softness under normal loads and hardness under
   transverse loads are both critical design conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An auxetic structure as a substrate material in sensor applications
   improves sensitivity performance due to lateral expansion under tensile
   loading. The presented stretchable, highly sensitive at-low-strain
   piezoresistive sensor was manufactured by mixing the silicone rubber and
   chopped carbon fibers in an auxetic re-entrant structure form. Auxetic
   re-entrant die was printed by using a 3D printing technique. The main
   feature of this sensor is the high sensitivity for strains lower than
   6\%, in which previous sensors could not recognize this range of strain
   well. In order to justify the excellent performance of the sensor, the
   deformation modes of the auxetic re-entrant structures were investigated
   and also connected to piezoresistive sensitivity. The shifting strain is
   defined as strain value, where the Poisson's ratio of structure shifts
   from negative to positive Poisson's ratio. Our study revealed that
   auxetic sensors have excellent sensitivity performance until the
   shifting strain due to having negative Poisson's ratio, and after that,
   their sensitivity performance is going to be weak due to having positive
   Poisson's ratio. In the present work, silicone rubber as the substrate
   material was used. This is a very soft material and made it possible to
   have low shifting strain resulting in perfect sensitivity performance
   for low-strain applications. The presented sensor has applications in
   many fields which are in low-strain conditions such as measuring the
   Vocal Cord Dysfunction (VCD), wrist pulse, or even earth vibration. (C)

Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials are synthetic materials with microstructures
   engineered to achieve negative Poisson's ratios. Auxetic metamaterials
   are of great interest because of their unusual properties and various
   potential applications. However, most of the previous research has been
   focused on auxetic behaviour of elastomers under elastic deformation.
   Inspired by our recent finding of the loss of auxetic behaviour in
   metallic auxetic metamaterials, a systematic experimental and numerical
   investigation has been carried out to explore the mechanism behind this
   phenomenon. Using an improved methodology of generating buckling-induced
   auxetic metamaterials, several samples of metallic auxetic metamaterials
   have been fabricated using a 3D printing technique. The experiments on
   those samples have revealed the special features of auxetic behaviour
   for metallic auxetic metamaterials and proved the effectiveness of our
   structural modification. Parametric studies have been performed through
   experimentally validated finite element models to explore the auxetic
   performance of the designed metallic metamaterials. It is found that the
   auxetic performance can be tuned by the geometry of microstructures, and
   the strength and stiffness can be tuned by the plasticity of the base
   material while maintaining the auxetic performance.}},

Abstract = {{The crash box can absorb energy from the beam as much as possible, so as
   to reduce the collision damage to the front part of the car body and
   protect the safety of passengers. This work proposes a novel crash box
   filled with a three-dimensional negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) inner
   core based on an inner hexagonal cellular structure. In order to
   optimize and improve the crash box's energy absorption performance, the
   multi-objective optimization model of the NPR crash box is established,
   which combines the optimal Latin hypercube design method and response
   surface methodology. Then, the microstructure parameters are further
   optimized by the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm
   to obtain an excellent energy absorption effect. The simulation results
   show that the proposed NPR crash box can generate smooth and
   controllable deformation to absorb the total energy, and it can further
   enhance the crashworthiness through the designed optimization algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This study intended for the assessment of the stiffness, tensile and
   bursting properties of 3D printed auxetic sinusoidal patterns of
   different density and thickness deposited on the nylon fabric by means
   of fused deposition modeling (FDM) with the use of thermoplastic
   polyurethane (TPU) filament. Morphology, weight variation, flex
   stiffness, tensile property, Poisson's ratio and bursting strength were
   analyzed for the characteristic evaluation of produced composite. The
   prototypes of two auxetic pattern repeat of 47 mmx43 mm and 20 mmx20 mm
   were developed named as low density (LD) and high density (HD)
   respectively. Both patterns were repeatedly combined to produce bigger
   size patterns and 3D printed with various thicknesses. Weight variation
   is found proportional to the density and thickness of 3D printed auxetic
   sinusoidal. Maximum up to 552 \% weight increase was recorded for LD
   pattern and for HD 857 \%. Flex stiffness increased with the rise of
   density and thickness of 3d printed auxetic sinusoidal pattern. Maximum
   flex stiffness for HD was 7.21 cm-g and for LD 4.73 cm-g. Warp direction
   is stiffest comparing with diagonal and weft in all cases. In case of
   tensile strength, a great extent of elongation was noticed due to the
   presence of auxetic sinusoidal 3D pattern and TPU filament. Maximum,
   more than 500 \% elongation was showed by HD diagonal direction. HD
   patters exhibited more strength and toughness than LD patterns. In
   addition, warp direction is strongest and diagonal direction is weakest
   whereas the weft stays in between. Both LD-1.0 and HD-1.0 3D printed
   pattern showed negative Poisson's ratio and the value was between -1.0
   to 0. The enhanced bursting strength is found in HD patterns up to 1514
   kPa comparing up to 1449 for LD. Thus, this study confirmed the
   excellent stiffness, tensile and bursting properties of HD 3D printed
   auxetic sinusoidal pattern/nylon composite over LD.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular structures like hexagonal honeycombs have been of particular
   interest because of their unique dynamic behavior. These periodic
   structures can control wave propagation through exhibiting pass and stop
   bands over certain frequency ranges. Geometrical modifications of unit
   cells in these hexagonal honeycombs have been explored to achieve
   different properties such as a negative Poisson's ratio, which is also
   known as auxetic materials. It is found that a characteristic angle of
   the unit cell determines the value of the Poisson's ratio. In this
   study, we investigate different topologies of unit cells through the
   Timoshenko beam-based finite element method and the principles of
   Floquet-Bloch theorem. We find that the characteristic angle of the unit
   cell has a significant effect on the in-plane wave propagation behavior
   and its directionality.}},

Abstract = {{Exact formulation for calculating effective elastic moduli of an
   isotropic two-phase disordered composite with ellipsoidal or elliptic
   inclusions are given in the mean-field approximation, which yields
   simple analytic expansions of effective Poisson ratio and Young's
   modulus to second order in the small asphericity parameters for nearly
   disc-like and spherical inclusions. Analytic expansions to fifth order
   in these parameters of the depolarizing or demagnetizing factors for
   nearly spherical ellipsoids have also been obtained, as have those to
   second order of the critical parameters of the auxeticity windows in the
   case of rigid auxetic inclusions randomly embedded in an incompressible
   matrix. For a matrix having a non-negative Poisson ratio, it is found
   that auxeticity windows for both inclusion volume or area fraction and
   the ratio of Young's modulus of inclusion to that of a matrix exist only
   for auxetic inclusions, and a maximum effective Young's modulus occurs
   at a certain value of volume fraction of auxetic inclusions that are not
   far from disc-like or spherical. This maximum Young's modulus effect may
   be exploited to produce technologically important high-strength auxetic
   composites. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes the manufacturing and tensile testing of auxetic
   (negative Poisson's ratio) thermoplastic polyurethane foams, both under
   constant strain rate and sinusoidal excitation. The foams are produced
   from conventional flexible polyurethane basis following a manufacturing
   route developed in previous works. The Poisson's ratio behaviour over
   tensile strain has been analyzed using an Image Data processing
   technique based on Edge Detection from digital images recorded during
   quasi-static tensile test. The samples have been subjected to tensile
   and compressive tests at quasi-static and constant strain-rate values
   (up to 12 s(-1)). Analogous tests have been performed over
   iso-volumetric foams samples, i.e., foams subjected to the same
   volumetric compression of the auxetic ones, exhibiting a near zero
   Poisson's ratio behaviour. The auxetic and non-auxetic foams have been
   also tested under sinusoidal cycling load up to 10 Hz, with maximum
   pre-strain applied of 12\%. The hysteresis of the cycling loading curve
   has been measured to determine the damping hysteretic loss factor for
   the various foams. The measurements indicate that auxetic foams have
   increased damping loss factor of 20\% compared to the conventional
   foams. The energy dissipation is particularly relevant in the tensile
   segment of the curve, with effects given by the pre-strain level imposed
   on the samples. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with a comparative study on the mechanical, acoustic,
   and electromagnetic properties of a novel class of auxetic (negative
   Poisson's ratio) rigid polyurethane (PU) foam with a magnetorheological
   (MR) fluid coating. An auxetic solid expands in all directions when
   pulled in only one, thus behaving in an opposite manner compared to
   `classical' solids. When compared with the conventional PU foam, the
   auxetic PU foam shows enhanced crashworthiness properties and increased
   sound absorption characteristics (at low frequencies). Samples of
   auxetic foam coated with MR fluid are examined in this work. While the
   tensile mechanical properties of the MR fluid-coated samples are
   affected mainly by surface effects, the acoustic absorption
   characteristics show almost constant values beyond the cut-off frequency
   level of the original uncoated auxetic foam. With regard to the foams'
   electromagnetic properties, the auxetic structure and MR coating cause
   an increase in the refractive index and loss factor compared to the
   conventional foams. These electromagnetic effects are due to the
   presence of a high relative density and metal particulates in the foam
   material.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose As a kind of common lightweight porous materials, honeycombs
   have a wide range of applications in aerospace, architecture, packaging
   and other fields. In this paper, four types of new gradient honeycombs
   with negative Poisson's ratio are obtained, including angle gradient,
   thickness gradient and functional gradient, which are obtained by
   changing the geometric or physical parameters of cells. Methods The
   dynamic responses of gradient auxetic honeycombs under different impact
   speeds are studied by ABAQUS display dynamic finite element method, and
   the deformation profiles of gradient honeycomb models are obtained. The
   nominal stress-strain curves and energy absorptions of the gradient
   auxetic honeycombs are studied, and the dynamic bearing capacity of the
   four kinds of gradient auxetic honeycombs is further analyzed. Results
   and Conclusion The results obtained in this paper show that the
   thickness of cell walls has a great influence on the impact resistance
   and vibration energy absorption of honeycomb structures. As for gradient
   honeycombs, the angle gradient honeycomb is better than the other three
   types in energy absorption, and the functional gradient honeycomb
   containing ceramic is less deformed. The research results in this paper
   will provide theoretical guidance for energy absorption, vibration

Abstract = {{Reservoir geomechanical parameters in ``Tobi{''} Field, Niger Delta were
   estimated using well log data with the intention of improving reservoir

   correlated across three (3) wells and their geomechanical parameters
   computed from empirical relations. Three (3) reservoir units were
   delineated from these wells that falls within the hydrocarbon windows

   include, but is not limited to, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, bulk

   heat production, vertical stress (overburden), minimum horizontal

   shear stress in direction of dip, and shear stress in direction of
   strike. The bivariate crossplots of heat production and Young's modulus
   indicated that the amount of heat produced by the shaly materials
   affects the elastic properties of the reservoir units and flow rate. The
   crossplots of Poisson's ratio versus compressional velocity are
   expressly well-defined and exponentially decaying with the compressional
   velocity, indicating an inverse relationship between the two (2)
   parameters. For stress tensor analysis, the study confirmed the defining
   condition of S-v > S-Hmax > S(hmin)as normal fault, which is fault
   regime prevalent in the study area, in line with Andersen's
   classification. Rotation of principal stresses on fault plane showed
   negative shear stress in strike direction. This research concluded that
   geomechanical parameters of hydrocarbon reservoirs in ``Tobi{''} field
   are diagnostic in reservoir characterization and in establishing the
   type of faults in reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{THE Poisson ratio of a solid characterizes its response to uniaxial
   stress. It is defined as the negative ratio of the transverse strain to
   the corresponding axial strain. Normally, this ratio is positive, as
   most solids expand in the transverse direction when subjected to a
   uniaxial compression. Although a negative Poisson ratio is not forbidden
   by thermodynamics, it is rare in crystalline solids: the results of
   recent experiments1 which observed a negative Poisson ratio in
   alpha-cristobalite were therefore unexpected. We have investigated the
   elastic behaviour of alpha-cristobalite and other forms of silica with
   first-principles calculations and classical interatomic potentials. Our
   calculations reproduce the negative Poisson ratio in alpha-cristobalite,
   and predict that alpha-quartz, the most common form of crystalline
   silica, will also exhibit a negative Poisson ratio under large uniaxial
   tension. We attribute the occurrence of a negative Poisson ratio in
   low-density silica polymorphs to the high rigidity of the SiO4
   tetrahedra.}},

Abstract = {{Negative and near-zero Poisson's ratio materials are mechanical
   metamaterials that host an improved strain energy absorption property
   with respect to conventional materials. By using first-principles
   calculations, we report the negative and near-zero Poisson's ratios in
   van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, such as graphene/hexagonal
   molybdenum disulfide (G/MoS2) and graphene/hexagonal boron nitride
   (G/h-BN), sharing distinct crystal structures from all other known
   negative and near-zero Poisson's ratio materials. However, the Poisson's
   ratios of the interfacial layer in bilayer MoS2 and h-BN are positive
   and near-zero along the out-of-plane direction, respectively, which are
   quite different from the Poisson's ratios of G/MoS2 and G/h-BN
   heterostructures. Therefore, these behaviors are unique to vdW
   heterostructures. We attribute these negative Poisson's ratio behaviors
   to the special interaction of p(z) orbitals between the interfacial
   layers. Furthermore, we observed among them high-order elastic constants
   in the out-of-plane direction, which exhibit nonlinear stress-strain
   responses. These results are significant for the preparation of G/h-BN
   and G/MoS2 heterostructures. The combinations of tunable
   negative/near-zero Poisson's ratios with the excellent
   electrical/optical properties of G/MoS2 and G/h-BN heterostructures will
   pave the way to a wide range of applications in novel auxetic molecular
   sieves and electrodes.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{237}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an investigation on the postbuckling behavior of sandwich
   plates with functionally graded (FG) auxetic 3D lattice core is
   presented. Firstly, an auxetic 3D lattice metamaterial is designed and
   analyzed, of which all six effective Poisson's ratios (EPRs) are
   negative, and the in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) property can
   enhance the structural buckling capacity. For the first time, two
   symmetric FG configurations of the auxetic 3D lattice core through the
   plate thickness direction are proposed, and compared with the uniform
   distribution case. Two kinds of compressive postbuckling due to in-plane
   uni-axial or bi-axial compression, and thermal postbuckling under
   uniform temperature rise are taken into account. In the current study,
   full-scale FE modelling and nonlinear analysis are carried out, in which
   the constituent materials possess temperature-dependent properties. The
   results of comparison study show that the compressive buckling and
   thermal postbuckling loads of sandwich plates with NPR core are
   remarkably higher than those of their counterparts having the 3D lattice
   core with positive EPR. Parametric studies are further performed to
   demonstrate the effects of functionally graded configurations,
   temperature changes, load-proportional parameters and plate aspect
   ratios on the postbuckling load-deflection curves, along with the
   EPR-deflection curves in the large deflection region.}},

Volume = {{163}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic composite laminates are a new type of engineering materials that
   have unique features for important potential applications. This paper
   examines the effect of in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) on the
   thermal postbuckling behaviors of graphene-reinforced metal matrix
   composite (GRMMC) plates. The plates rest on an elastic foundation and
   are subjected to a uniform temperature rise. The GRMMC layers with
   different volume fractions of graphene reinforcement can be arranged to
   achieve piece-wise functionally graded (FG) patterns across the plate
   thickness and the material properties of the GRMMC layers are
   temperature-dependent. The Reddy's third order shear deformation plate
   theory and the geometric nonlinearity of von Karman-type are applied to
   formulate the thermal postbuckling equations for GRMMC laminated plates.
   The nonlinear problem can be solved by a two-step perturbation approach.
   Parametric study is performed for (+/- 10)(5T) and (+/- 10)(3T) GRMMC
   laminated plates possessing in-plane NPR. The results reveal that the
   buckling temperatures for (+/- 10)(5T) and (+/- 10)(3T) plates are
   significantly enhanced with an FG-X pattern for the plates. We found
   that due to the combined effect of FG and in-plane NPR, the thermal
   postbuckling strength of FG-X (+/- 10)(3T) plate is higher than that of
   FG-X (+/- 10)(5T) plate.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the compression response of additively manufactured
   novel soft porous structures with architected microstructure. Six porous
   additively manufactured architected periodic structures with two-fold
   and four-fold symmetry were considered. The effect of pore shape and
   fold symmetry of microstructure on the non-linear response of a square
   array of architected pores in a soft polymeric matrix is experimentally
   investigated. The digital image correlation (DIC) is used for
   investigating the evolution of strains and deformation during uniaxial
   tensile tests and compression tests of porous structures. Compression
   induced instability lead to negative Poisson's ratio, and compaction of
   porous structures, which is found to depend not only on the shape of the
   architecture but also the fold symmetry exists in the microstructure's
   unit cell. Unique architectures with multiple buckling modes and shape
   transformation are also observed. Two-fold symmetry structures are found
   to buckle at lower strains compared to the four-fold symmetric structure
   at the same porosity level and produced high compaction and negative
   Poisson's ratio. The results showed that in addition to pore shape, the
   fold symmetry could be used effectively to design a new class of soft,
   active, and reconfigurable devices over a wide range of length scales
   with desired characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the nonlinear transient responses of an auxetic
   (negative Poisson's ratio) honeycomb sandwich plate under impact dynamic
   loads. The partial differential equations of the honeycomb sandwich

   the honeycomb sandwich plate subjected to different loads, such as step
   loading, air-blast loading, sinusoidal loading, triangular loading and
   incremental loading, respectively, have been investigated. The
   contributions of total thickness, core thickness ratio, Poisson's ratio,
   cell inclination angle and blast types to transient responses of the
   plate are discussed in detail by numerical simulations. The effect of
   geometrical parameters on the dynamics of the plate and the effect of
   different blast loads on the plate are obtained. It is found that the

Abstract = {{This paper reports a study on the large amplitude vibration and
   nonlinear bending behaviors of hybrid laminated plates made of carbon
   nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) layers bonded with metal layer on
   the top surface. The hybrid CNTRC/metal laminated plates with
   out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are proposed. The effective
   material properties of CNTRC layer are graded in the thickness direction
   in a piece-wise pattern. The material properties of both CNTRC layer and
   metal layer are temperature dependent. The plates are placed on an
   elastic foundation and in thermal environments. The Reddy's third order
   shear deformation plate theory is utilized to establish the motion
   equations of the hybrid CNTRC/metal laminated plate. These equations
   include the geometric nonlinearity in the von Karman sense, the thermal
   effects and the plate-foundation interaction. By employing a two-step
   perturbation approach the nonlinear vibration and bending solutions are
   obtained. A comparison of nonlinear responses of hybrid CNTRC/metal
   laminated plates with positive and negative Poisson's ratios under

Abstract = {{Bioinspired structure/material has attracted attentions in engineering
   fields. In this article, a novel sandwich cylinder inspired by shore
   horsetail is proposed by introducing the double-arrowed auxetic filler.
   The energy absorption characteristics of the sandwich cylinder are

   show its superiority. The effects of the geometric parameters on the
   energy absorption characteristics are also discussed. It is found that
   the number of layers and cells for auxetic structures, thickness of
   beams and thin-walled tubes, and the radius of the inner tube have great
   effects on the crushing force, energy absorption, initial peak force and
   specific energy absorption. The sandwich cylinder will be a great energy

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to analyze the impact behavior on the

   composite and an auxetic composite using high performance yarns. Weft
   knitted fabrics were produced with the same structural and machine
   parameters, using 100\% para-aramid and hybrid (47\% para-aramid and
   53\% polyamide) structure. Composite fabrication was achieved through
   hand lay-up using epoxy resin. Negative Poisson ratio of the reinforcing
   auxetic fabric was transferred from the fabric to the composite
   developed. Results obtained by drop weight dart impact test show that
   the impact experiment with different impact loads confirmed the auxetic
   composites, regardless de material composition, have an increase in the
   total energy absorption compared to jersey reinforced composite,
   approximately 2.5 and 4 times more for para-aramid and hybrid composite,
   respectively. Auxetic composites developed within this work present
   great potential for applications in different areas, mainly where energy

Volume = {{26}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this research, the effects of negative chemical pressure on various
   physical properties of SrFeO3 were investigated by partially
   substituting larger Mo at smaller Fe-site. The calculated lattice
   parameters exhibited a linear increasing trend according to the Vegard's
   rule with increasing doping of Mo confirmed the existence of negative
   chemical pressure within the compound. The calculated formation enthalpy
   as well as elastic constants that satisfied the Born criteria ensured
   the structural and mechanical stability, respectively, of our system
   under varied doping of Mo. In addition, the mechanical properties,
   including the elastic moduli, Pugh's ratio, Poisson's ratio, hardness,
   and machinability index, were also successfully investigated and
   noticeably affected by the negative chemical pressure induced by doping.
   Moreover, it would be possible to tune the band structure of SrFeO3 by
   partially substituting Mo at Fe-site. The accumulation of electron
   carriers in the vicinity of Fermi level was increased with the increment
   of doping level, which was justified by DOS calculations. More
   interestingly, the flat bands close to the Fermi level predicted the

Title = {{Design and analysis for large magnitudes of programmable Poisson's ratio
   in a series of lightweight cylindrical metastructures}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Cylindrical metastructures, which have the exclusive programmability in
   Poisson's ratio, are widely used in engineering. Herein, a series of
   cylindrical metastructures with programmable Poisson's ratio were
   devised via the curling of the planar metamaterials. The relationships
   of the deformation characteristics and Poisson's ratio between the
   cylindrical metastructures and planar metamaterials were systematically
   analyzed. It is originally identified that the number of the
   circumferential unit cell N remarkably affects the deformation modes.
   When N is small, the warp effect, induced by the curved members, is
   remarkable. The cylindrical metastructures present the petal- and
   polygon-like deformation modes. Consequently, the Poisson's ratios
   deviate notably from those of the planar metamaterials. Further, the
   quantitative analysis figures out that when N is larger than specific
   critical values, the Poisson's ratios approach to those of the planar
   metamaterials. Thus this work identifies a design strategy, i.e. once
   the circumferential unit cells are sufficiently dense, the Poisson's
   ratios of the cylindrical metastructures can be predicted by the theory
   of the corresponding planar metamaterials. Moreover, through modulating
   the geometric parameters, large magnitudes of both positive and negative
   Poisson's ratio are obtained. This extraordinary feature of the large
   radial expansion and shrinkage, actuated through a slight axial
   stretching, can be used in shape morphing and deployable devices. The
   design and analysis provide a perspective on the multifunctional
   metastructures with programmable Poisson's ratio.}},

   the present model, and parametric studies are carried out to reveal the
   relative influence of selective parameters on buckling behavior of
   CHSP-NPR. The results show the increase of the proportion of honeycomb
   core and the decrease of fiber volume fraction of face sheet may
   increase the negative Poisson?s ratio and weaken the buckling resistance

   conventional honeycomb sandwich plate under the same conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The diverse forms of silicon carbides lead to versatile properties, but
   an auxetic allotrope at zero pressure has never been reported. Here,
   using first-principles calculations we propose a two-dimensional (2D)
   auxetic silicon carbide material, namely SiC6 siligraphene. The
   plausibility of the SiC6 siligraphene is verified by the low formation
   energy, positive phonon spectrum and high mechanical stability. The
   unique framework of sp(2) carbon and sp(3) silicon atoms leads to
   unusual in-plane negative Poisson's ratios and electronic properties
   superior to both graphene and silicene. SiC6 siligraphene possesses a
   natural band gap of 0.73 eV and a high carrier mobility. The theoretical
   mobility in the order of 104 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for electrons along the
   {[}(1) over bar 10] direction is comparable to the hole mobility in
   black phosphorene, whereas the hole transport along the {[}110]
   direction is blocked. Both the electronic band structure and carrier
   mobility of the SiC6 siligraphene can be tuned by applying external
   strain. A possible synthetic route is also proposed. The exotic
   properties make SiC6 siligraphene a versatile and promising 2D material
   for applications in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.}},

Title = {{4D printed auxetic structures with tunable mechanical properties}},
Journal = {{ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{35}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing has revolutionized the entire design cycle across
   a wide range of industries. The majority of materials utilized in 3D
   printing result in rather rigid structures with a fixed set of
   properties. Four-dimensional printing (4D printing) addresses this
   limitation by relaxing the geometric/properties rigidity over time. The
   careful selection of structural designs and the use of active and smart
   materials enables a unique set of shapes and properties to be programmed
   and achieved. This deviation from rigid structures with a fixed set of
   properties enables novel and unique applications in robotics, deployable
   structures, biomedical, and aerospace industries. The current work is
   focused on an interesting class of structures, 2D auxetic cellular
   solids, which exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. 4D printing of such
   structures allows for tunable structural stiffness, Poisson's ratio, and
   rigidity. This work aims to experimentally investigate the tunability of
   stiffness and Poisson's ratio in 4D printed auxetic structures
   fabricated using a thermoplastic shape-memory polymer. The attained
   structural stiffness was tuned in the range of 0.179 - 0.242 kN/mm while
   the in-plane Poisson's ratio was controlled from -0.33 up to even
   positive magnitudes of +0.69. This wide range of elastic properties was
   obtained from a single structure programmed to different deformation
   levels. Experimental evaluation of 4D printed SMP structures under
   constant cyclic programming/recovery conditions induced residual strains
   which consequently affected the mechanical properties by degrading the
   Poisson's ratio and structural stiffness. The magnitude of induced
   residual strains depends on the level of applied deformation during
   programing and the number of applied programing/recovery cycles. At the
   local level, full-field measurements revealed the localization of
   strains within the complex heterogeneous structure of the axially loaded
   auxetic honeycomb samples.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, through the use of a theoretical model, we analyse the
   potential of a specific three-dimensional mechanical metamaterial
   composed of arrowhead-like structural units to exhibit a negative
   Poisson's ratio for an arbitrary loading direction. Said analysis allows
   us to assess its suitability for use in applications where materials
   must be able to respond in a desired manner to a stimulus applied in
   multiple directions. As a result of our studies, we show that the
   analysed system is capable of exhibiting auxetic behaviour for a broad
   range of loading directions, with isotropic behaviour being shown in
   some planes. In addition to that, we show that there are also certain
   loading directions in which the system manifests negative linear
   compressibility. This enhances its versatility and suitability for a
   number of applications where materials exhibiting auxetic behaviour or
   negative linear compressibility are normally implemented.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper experimentally investigates the behavior of sandwich beam
   with auxetic core subjected to low-velocity impact loading. Two types of
   sandwich beams with different topologies of auxetic cellular cores were
   produced. Furthermore, a test procedure involving a cylindrical impactor
   was developed, and a parametric study was designed and performed. The
   results revealed that, at the same level of impact energy, the peak load
   decreased by increasing the re-entrant angle would make the auxetic,
   sample with the highest re-entrant angle an ideal candidate for
   protective applications. However, in other applications where the
   structure needs to be protected from damage at a higher level of impact
   energy, the auxetic sample with the lowest re-entrant angle exhibited
   the best performance due to the highest amount of failure energy.
   Finally, the results showed that once the core structure changed from
   the conventional to auxetic, the energy level leading to damage to the
   structure increased so that it was escalated by a factor of 2 in the
   auxetic sample compared to the conventional sample. This is due to the
   negative Poisson's ratio effect of structure that makes unit cells be
   drawn into the projectile impact area and, in turn, the structure is
   strengthened.}},

Title = {{Quasi-static crushing behavior of novel re-entrant circular auxetic
   honeycombs}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{197}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Honeycombs with re-entrant (RE) unit cells were found to have negative
   Poisson's ratios (NPRs) and enhanced energy absorption capabilities than
   regular hexagon honeycombs. For further improved energy absorption
   capacity, a novel re-entrant circular (REC) honeycomb configuration is
   proposed in this work by replacing the sloped cell wall of the regular
   re-entrant honeycomb with double circular arc cell walls, which can
   dissipate extra energy due to more formed plastic angles during the
   crushing process. The in-plane quasi-static crushing response of the REC
   honeycomb with large deformation was investigated theoretically and
   numerically. The numerical modeling methods in LS-DYNA software were
   validated by using the quasi-static crush test data of 3D-printed REC
   honeycomb specimens. Experiment and numerical simulations both revealed
   that quasi-static load can result in an ``X{''} mode deformation of the
   REC honeycomb. Based on the simulated deformation profiles of the
   representative unit, theoretical models were derived to predict the REC
   honeycomb's crushing strength, i.e. plateau stress. Good agreements were
   found between the theoretical and the numerical results within a
   relative error about 9\%. Parametric analyses further showed that the
   unit cell configuration has a great effect on the crushing strength of
   the REC honeycomb. The REC honeycomb presents a varied Poisson's ratio
   with the global strain of the honeycomb; smaller radius to height ratio
   and length to height ratio were found to yield more pronounced NPR
   effect. Moreover, compared with the regular RE honeycomb, the specific
   energy absorption of the REC honeycomb is much higher due to the
   introduction of the double circular arc cell walls.}},

   graphene}},
Journal = {{DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{66-74}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{To investigate the property of anisotropic Poisson's ratio in graphene,
   we use the molecular dynamics (MD) method to simulate the stretching
   process. Pristine graphene and graphene with Stone - Wales (SW) defect,
   5-8-5 defect and di-vacancy defect are investigated. The results show
   that the Poisson's ratio always depends on the tensile strain and is
   sensitive to the tensile angle between the tensile direction and the
   armchair direction. For perfect graphene, its Poisson's ratio will
   transform from a positive value to a negative value at a critical
   strain. In the cases of smaller tensile angles, the corresponding
   Poisson's ratio and the critical strain are smaller, and even the
   negative Poisson's ratio is observed. For the defective graphene cases,
   it is found that a negative Poisson's ratio is more easily observed with
   higher defect concentrations. The negative Poisson's ratios of the
   graphene with 5-8-5 type defect and SW defect always arise from the
   wrinkles induced by these topologic defects. However, the negative
   Poisson's ratio of graphene with di-vacancy defect is caused by the
   deformation of graphene lattice structure, which is the same as the
   pristine graphene. The wrinkles in defective graphene are more likely to
   cause negative Poisson's ratio of graphene than its lattice structure
   deformations.}},

Abstract = {{Most two-dimensional negative Poisson's ratio structures are highly
   porous, resulting in insufficient structural bearing capacity and only
   for small strain conditions. In this paper, the simulation method is
   used to prove that the low porosity and negative Poisson's ratio
   structure with concave hexagon has ``incremental{''} behavior, and then
   the correctness of the simulation model is verified by experiments based
   on digital image technology (DIC). In addition, the effect of unit cell
   parameters on the negative Poisson's ratio at the same porosity is
   studied. The results show that at the same porosity, the length of the
   unit cell has the greatest influence on the Poisson's ratio, and the
   longer the unit cell, the smaller the Poisson's ratio; at different
   porosity, the larger the porosity, the lager the Poisson's ratio.}},

Title = {{The effect of the measurement frequency on the elastic anisotropy of
   fibre laminates}},

Abstract = {{Static tests and ultrasonic measurements (2.25 MHz) have been carried
   out on a series of composite laminates of glass fibres in a
   polypropylene matrix. A range of angle ply laminates were prepared for
   this study, with laminate angles theta of +/- 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40
   degrees. The high frequency measurements were made using the ultrasonic
   immersion technique, which allows the determination of a complete set of
   the elastic constants of a material. The relationship between the
   ultrasonically determined elastic constants of the angle ply laminates
   was found to be in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, as
   previously validated for carbon fibre/epoxy angle ply laminates.
   A comparison between the ultrasonic and statically measured values was
   made for two of the angle ply laminates (theta = 0 and 20 degrees). It
   was found that the static values were lower than those measured at
   ultrasonic frequency, particularly those constants that were more matrix
   dominated (for example the transverse moduli of the laminates).
   Measurements on a pure polypropylene sample at both testing frequencies
   confirmed that the change in matrix properties with frequency was the
   cause of this difference. The change in properties with test frequency
   is likely to be much larger in this system than in other composite
   materials because the glass transition temperature of polypropylene is
   close to ambient temperature. Dynamic mechanical tests (1 Hz) were
   carried out on a sample of pure polypropylene to assess this effect. We
   also give an appropriate method of estimating the dependence of glass
   transition temperature on frequency. The results for polypropylene are
   compared with those for other commonly used polymer matrix materials:
   epoxy resin, nylon and polyetheretherketone (PEEK): DMTA measurements
   were also made on these samples.
   The effect of test frequency on matrix properties, for the glass/PP
   laminates, was further investigated by examining the relationship of the
   Poisson's ratios with laminate angle using a mixture of ultrasonic
   experiments and theoretical predictions. Previously we have shown that
   the degree of anisotropy between the reinforcing fibre and the matrix
   phase is paramount in determining whether the material will show a
   negative Poisson's ratio at a critical laminate angle. The ultrasonic
   measurements carried out in this study on the glass/PP laminates showed
   a minimum in one of the Poisson's ratio at a laminate angle of 32
   degrees, but the value did not become negative. However, theoretical
   predictions showed that for a static frequency measurement (1 Hz), where
   the matrix is softer and hence the anisotropy of each laminate ply is
   higher, the laminate will show a negative Poisson's ratio with a minimum
   at a laminate angle of around 28 degrees. (c) 2005 Springer Science +

Abstract = {{Herein, two kinds of 3D hexagonal honeycomb equivalent models are
   proposed, enlightened by the octahedron model constructed by the
   wine-rack mechanism. They differ in their unit-cell arrangement forms,
   which are array and homogeneous arrangements, respectively. Referring to
   the analysis of the octahedron model, the expressions of compressibility
   properties of the two new models are given and the conditions for
   obtaining negative compressibility are analyzed. Comparing these two
   models with the octahedron model, it is found that although the three
   models are quite different in externality, they have similar mechanical
   properties (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and compressibility), and
   all have image symmetry in both horizontal directions. Further analysis
   shows that these three models are so unified that they can be expressed
   by a more general model, from which another model with negative
   compressibility can be deduced. Finally, a new method to improve
   negative compressibility property is concluded from comparing the three
   models, that is, increasing the number or length of rods without
   deformation in vertical direction can effectively improve negative
   compressibility property in this direction and weaken negative
   compressibility property in the other two directions.}},

Title = {{Quasi-static axial compressive properties and energy absorption of
   star-triangular auxetic honeycomb}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{267}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{To systematically and comprehensively investigate the in-plane
   compression behavior of star-triangular honeycomb (STH) under
   quasi-static load, a group of specimens were fabricated by additive
   manufacturing technology and a compression test was carried out. The
   results show that the deformation of STH is stable, and negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect is obvious in the 1-direction. However,
   this effect is weakened in the 2-direction. Subsequently, numerical
   simulation models were established to understand the small and large
   deformation behaviors of STH in detail. In accordance with the
   deformation mechanism of STH in different directions, theoretical
   analysis models were developed to predict their elastic modulus and
   Poisson's ratio, and the results were highly consistent with the
   numerical simulation results. Detailed parameter analysis shows that the
   influence of inclined angle theta on the elastic modulus and Poisson's
   ratio of STH is more obvious than that of t/l. Additionally, with the
   increase in the inclined angle, the deformation of STH has no obvious
   difference in the 1-direction while it is considerably different in the
   2-direction. When the strain is small, the plateau stress of STH with
   the same cell-wall angle alpha is similar in different directions. Then,
   the value of plateau stress and duration of the plateau stage varies
   greatly with the increase of compression strain. Finally, the energy
   absorption capacity of STH in different directions was compared. The
   results show that the energy absorption capacity of STH in the
   2-direction is much higher than that in the 1-direction. Furthermore,
   two energy absorbing stages appear in the compression process of STH,
   among which the energy contribution of the second stage occupies the
   largest proportion. This study aims to provide guidelines for the
   engineering application of STH.}},

Abstract = {{The structural variations with pressure in alpha-cristobalite, a
   low-density polymorph of SiO2, have been studied through
   first-principles calculations using the projector-augmentcd-wave (PAW)
   method, with particular emphasis on its elastic and auxetic properties.
   We provide theoretical ab initio results for the volume compressibility
   and a complete set of independent elastic constants of cristobalite
   under hydrostatic pressures up to 10-15 GPa. Our calculated structural
   and elastic properties under pressure are in good agreement with the
   experimental data. In addition, the corresponding results of the
   molecular-dynamics simulations with the interatomic potential are also
   presented for comparison. The dominant mechanism of compression is the
   reduction of the Si-O-Si angles within the alpha-cristobalite structure,
   whereas the SiO4 tetrahedron undergoes only a slight distortion.
   alpha-Cristobalite is more compressible than other SiO2 polymorphs as
   shown by their volume compressibilities, because of its characteristic
   framework structure similar to re-entrant honeycombs. With increasing
   pressure, the rotational motions of the rigid SiO4 tetrahedra play an
   important role in the compressive behavior of cristobalite. The present
   simulations confirm that the system undergoes transformation from
   auxetic to non-auxetic under hydrostatic pressure of ca. 2 GPa, while
   retaining strong elastic anisotropy.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic small diameter vascular grafts frequently fail owing to
   intimal hyperplasia, results from mismatched compliance between the
   vascular graft and native vessels. A vascular graft with a negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR, materials expand transversely when pulled axially)
   was suggested to enhance compliance. We produced a three-layer tubular
   vascular scaffold with NRP properties. The luminal side consisted of
   nanosized electrospun fibers for endothelial cell (EC) growth. The
   middle layer was an NPR structure created using 3D printing, and the
   outer layer was a microsized electrospun fiber layer for vascular smooth
   muscle cell (VSMC) growth. The developed multi-layer tubular vascular
   scaffold contained NPR value. And the NPR vascular scaffold showed 1.7
   time higher compliance than the PPR scaffold and 3.8 times higher than
   that of commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular graft. In
   addition, the ECs and VSMCs were well survived and proliferated on the
   scaffold during 10 days of culture. From the optimized co-culture
   condition of the VSMCs and ECs that VSMC phenotype changed was
   inhibited, we successfully generated a thin luminal layer, which
   consisted of ECs and the proper thickness of the VSMC layer under the
   ECs. This scaffold may have a potential to replace conventional
   artificial vascular graft by providing enhanced compliance and improved

Abstract = {{The properties of the Poisson's ratio of microcellular foams with an
   internal pressure in the voids and low porosity are investigated. Of
   prime interest is the effect of the matrix creep on the deformation of
   the foam and how this effect influences the later deformation
   characteristics of the material in terms of a Poisson description.
   First, the definitions of Poisson's ratio for the microcellular foams
   under uniaxial stress are reviewed. Second, the deformation of the
   microvoids under the influence of the internal pressure is analyzed by
   means of Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method. Next, the formula of the
   macroscopic strain of the microcellular foams is derived by using
   Mori-Tanaka's scheme, and based on this formula, the expression of the
   Poisson's ratio of the material is obtained. Further, the calculation of
   the Poisson's ratio of the material is then carried out. Numerical
   results show that the Poisson's ratio of the microcellular foams is a
   time-dependent parameter. It is also discussed that because of the
   effect of the internal pressure in the voids, the global Poisson's ratio
   may be negative. Under the action of remote compressive load, the
   Poisson's ratio of the microcellular foams may be unbounded. Finally,
   the effects of the loading rate, the Poisson's ratio and the relaxation
   time of the polymeric matrix material, the porosity, and the pressure in
   the microvoids on the Poisson's ratio are discussed with the aid of
   numerical estimates. These analytical results indicate that the
   Poisson's ratio under uniaxial tension is different from that under
   uniaxial compression.}},

   Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{131}},

Abstract = {{In order to comprehensively understand the dynamic response of auxetic
   honeycombs, theoretical analysis are conducted to predict the NPR effect
   and the crushing stress of the re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb. The
   honeycomb's crushing stress is a function of the cell's geometric
   parameters, crushing velocity and the mechanical property of the
   cell-wall material. Results show that the crushing stress enhances with
   the increasing crushing velocity. A dynamic sensitivity index is
   employed to quantitatively evaluate this enhancement. It is shown that
   small cell-wall angle, low relative density or high cell-wall length
   ratio of the honeycomb attribute high velocity-sensitivity to the
   crushing stress. The Poisson's ratio of the re-entrant honeycomb is also
   expressed as a function of the cell's geometric parameters. It is
   revealed that the NPR effect enhances with the increasing cell-wall
   angle and the decreasing cell-wall length ratio. All the theoretical
   predictions are verified by numerical simulations. Besides, an
   interesting phenomenon is noticed that the crushing velocity has
   significant influence on the honeycomb's NPR effect at the early stage
   of crushing. However, this influence almost vanishes when the overall
   strain is larger than about 0.2. This present work is supposed to shed
   light on the design of the auxetic honeycomb.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores Poisson's ratio, starting with the controversy
   concerning its magnitude and uniqueness in the context of the molecular
   and continuum hypotheses competing in the development of elasticity
   theory in the nineteenth century, moving on to its place in the
   development of materials science and engineering in the twentieth
   century, and concluding with its recent re-emergence as a universal
   metric for the mechanical performance of materials on any length scale.
   During these episodes France lost its scientific pre-eminence as
   paradigms switched from mathematical to observational, and accurate
   experiments became the prerequisite for scientific advance. The
   emergence of the engineering of metals followed, and subsequently the
   invention of composites-both somewhat separated from the discovery of
   quantum mechanics and crystallography, and illustrating the bifurcation
   of technology and science. Nowadays disciplines are reconnecting in the
   face of new scientific demands. During the past two centuries, though,
   the shape versus volume concept embedded in Poisson's ratio has remained
   invariant, but its application has exploded from its origins in
   describing the elastic response of solids and liquids, into areas such
   as materials with negative Poisson's ratio, brittleness, glass
   formation, and a re-evaluation of traditional materials. Moreover, the
   two contentious hypotheses have been reconciled in their complementarity
   within the hierarchical structure of materials and through computational
   modelling.}},

Pages = {{481-488}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Elastic networks model that is used to model a class of two-dimensional
   cellular structures including reentrant and regular honeycombs is
   considered. Two mechanical parameters (longitudinal stiffness and
   torsional stiffness) are used to describe the interaction between the
   nodes in a lattice for a given geometry. Effective properties with
   emphasis on the auxeticy of solid materials corresponding to the
   considered microstructures are investigated. A method based on
   comparison of the strain energies at macro and microscale is proposed to
   determine the effective properties of continuum and can be applied to
   other cellular materials. All components of stiffness tensor are
   determined as functions of interaction parameters. Thus, the general
   parametric study of the honeycomb structures is made possible.
   Re-entrant honeycomb structures demonstrate the auxetic properties at
   any combination of parameters whereas the regular honeycombs can have
   both positive and negative Poisson's ratios. Comparison with other model
   shows that the 2-parameter elastic networks can successfully describe
   isotropic materials. However in cases of higher anisotropy this model
   can be used within certain limitations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{MATERIALS that expand in the transverse direction under uniaxial
   extension, or that contract laterally when compressed, are said to have
   a negative Poisson's ratio, nu. For an isotropic elastic material, nu is
   the negative of the ratio of lateral to axial strain under uniaxial
   extension or compression. Despite the apparently counter-intuitive
   nature of this behaviour, nu < 0 has been observed for some anisotropic
   crystals 1 and materials comprised of fibrous networks 2,3, when loaded
   in a specific direction. Lakes 4 has described a class of foams that
   constitute perhaps the only known isotropic materials with negative-nu.
   Materials of this sort are expected to have interesting mechanical
   properties, such as high energy absorption and fracture resistance,
   which may be useful in some applications 4. Here we describe a general
   class of microstructures that lead to a negative Poisson's ratio, and
   show that some existing and hypothetical materials with this property
   share features common to this class. Our microstructural model provides
   insight into why natural materials of this kind are rare, and suggests a
   general methodology for designing such materials.}},

Abstract = {{In nature, repeated base units produce handed structures that

   are scale-independent frameworks made from repeated unit cells that

   alignments of auxetic tilings. Using the symmetry and alignment rules
   that we developed, we made handed shearing auxetics that tile planes,
   cylinders, and spheres. By compositing the handed shearing auxetics in a
   manner inspired by keratin and collagen, we produce both compliant
   structures that expand while twisting and deployable structures that can
   rigidly lock. This work opens up new possibilities in designing chemical

Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{45-52}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The dynamic modelling of a simply-supported thin laminated plate subject
   to in-plane excitation is established based on the classic shear theory
   and von Karman nonlinear theory. The method of multiple scales is used
   to determine an approximate solution for the system. According to
   solvability conditions, the nonlinear modulation equations arising from
   the principal parametric resonances are obtained and two possible
   nontrivial solutions are performed. To analyze the nonlinear dynamic
   response of the plate embedded with auxetic layers, 5-layered sandwich
   plate, in which two auxetic elastic layers are alternatively sandwiched
   between three positive Poisson's ratio (PPR) elastic ones, is presented.
   The natural frequency of model (m, n) shows an increase with respect to
   the absolute value of Poisson's ratio. Particularly, the
   amplitude-frequency responses of the laminated plate subject to
   principal parametric resonance are analyzed for different values of
   Poisson's ratio. Moreover, it can be found that for model (m, n), there
   must be some certain value or interval of negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR), which, results in zero response effect, in other words, the
   in-plane excitation will be ineffective for this model when the
   Poisson's ratio just lies at such a value or interval. Furthermore, it
   can also be observed that the certain interval of Poisson's ratio
   becomes wider with the increase of damping. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are uniquely engineered form of periodically
   arranged unit cells that exhibit interesting frequency-dependent
   physical properties like negative effective mass, Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio. These extreme engineering properties are beyond the
   natural properties of a material, which can modulate the propagation of
   wave. In this article, a mechanical realization of one of these uncommon
   properties called negative stiffness is emulated through analytical
   simulation. Wave propagation in metamaterials is contingent on
   frequency, which in turn results in transmission and attenuation bands.
   Simultaneous vibration control and energy harvesting can be executed by
   embedding energy harvesting smart material within the resonating units
   of the metamaterial. However, this needs careful design studies to
   outline the range of parameters. In this work, first, the band structure
   of a piezo-embedded negative stiffness metamaterial is studied using
   generalized Bloch's theorem. Subsequently, harvested power along with
   the transmissibility is computed for a chain of finite number of
   metamaterial units by using backward substitution method. The results of
   the parametric studies elucidate that piezo-embedded negative stiffness
   metamaterial can enhance the performance in terms of vibration
   attenuation and harvested energy.}},

Abstract = {{Bamboo is a light weight, high strength natural composite. Although it
   has been wildly used in the world for thousand years, the mechanism of
   material enhancement and microstructure/property relationships has not
   been well understood yet. In this study, triple points bending tests
   were conducted for mechanical behavior characterization of natural
   composite-bamboo. Digital Image Correlation was utilized to determine
   the deformation and strain of a bamboo beam. It was found that (a) the
   material responses to the applied load had both a linear and a
   non-linear range, (b) the beam was stiffer when it had node at two ends,
   (c) the neutral axis shifted toward the tensile side of the beam during
   loading process, (d) when samples were reloaded, the material responses
   to the load were different, (e) negative Poisson's ration was found in
   the high fiber density of the beam.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials (or metamaterials) are those with a negative Poisson
   ratio (NPR) and display the unexpected property of lateral expansion
   when stretched, as well as an equal and opposing densification when
   compressed. Such geometries are being progressively employed in the
   development of novel products, especially in the fields of intelligent
   expandable actuators, shape morphing structures and minimally invasive
   implantable devices. Although several auxetic and potentially auxetic
   geometries have been summarized in previous reviews and research,
   precise information regarding relevant properties for design tasks is
   not always provided.
   In this study we present a comparative study of two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional auxetic geometries carried out by means of
   computer-aided design and engineering tools (from now on CAD-CAE). The
   first part of the study is focused on the development of a CAD library
   of auxetics. Once the library is developed we simulate the behavior of
   the different auxetic geometries and elaborate a systematic comparison,
   considering relevant properties of these geometries, such as Poisson
   ratio(s), maximum volume or area reductions attainable and equivalent
   Young's modulus, hoping it may provide useful information for future
   designs of devices based on these interesting structures.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized linear models are often used to analyse discrete data. There

   Econometrics. 1997; 77: 329-342] developed an R2-like measure based on a
   ratio of deviances. This quantity has since been adjusted to accommodate
   both overspecification and overdispersion. While these statistics are
   useful for Poisson and negative binomial regression models, count data
   often include many zeros, a phenomenon that is often handled via
   zero-inflated (ZI) regression models. Building on Cameron and
   Windmeijer's work, we propose R2 statistics for the ZI Poisson and ZI
   negative binomial regression contexts. We also propose adjusted R2-like
   versions of these quantities to avoid inflation of these statistics due
   to the inclusion of irrelevant covariates in the model. The properties

   use is illustrated on two data sets involving counts with excess zeros.}},

Abstract = {{A novel mechanism is identified leading to negative linear
   compressibility (NLC) in boron arsenate which is shown to arise from
   deformations in the framework tetrahedra rather than more conspicuous
   tetrahedral rotations. Instead, such rotations, which manifest as
   ``rotating squares{''} when viewed down the c direction, are found to
   result in negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in the (001) plane, which in
   turn augments the compressibility, a phenomenon that should be

   compressibility due to auxeticity should also feature in materials and

Abstract = {{Deformation/deflection of thin shells/membranes with clamped boundaries
   is a common material behaviour relevant to many engineering and medical
   conditions. A detailed understanding of the deformation mechanisms of
   different materials/structures with different Poisson's ratios under
   such a loading condition is of great significance to materials testing
   and product development. In this work, the deformation of circular
   elastic membranes with a clamped edge under point loading and finite
   contact conditions is systematically studied incorporating auxeticity
   behaviours. The effect of Poisson's ratio on the deformation of the
   material is investigated and the influence of parameters including
   sample thickness, indentation depth and indenter size is analysed. The
   feasibility and limitation of an analytical solution is evaluated. The
   work shows that the P/(3) relationship is applicable to describe the
   force-displacement data over the membrane domain for both point loading
   and finite contact conditions. It is shown that negative Poisson's
   ratios have direct influence on the membrane deformation domain,
   including the force-displacement curve, the deflection profile and the
   contact area. Critical factors affecting the P-h curves and the
   deformation mechanisms are discussed with reference to potential use of
   the Poisson's ratio effects. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{This paper presents a design method of Auxetic Bending-Active Gridshells
   (ABAGs), which are curved surfaces generated from the initial flat grid
   with 2-dimensional auxetic patterns. One of the mechanical properties of
   ABAGs is that a dome-like shape of a curved surface can be easily
   obtained by bending a grid due to negative Poisson's ratio for in-plane
   deformation. Shapes of auxetic patterns are relevant to Poisson's ratio.
   Non-periodic and/or hybrid 2-dimensional auxetic patterns are developed
   for designing the initial flat grid of ABAGs. Shape parameters are the
   sizes of each plane unit for tuning its reentrant pattern, and two types
   of reentrant shapes are mixed on an initial flat grid. Using the
   non-uniform patterns, we can obtain an asymmetric and more complex
   free-form surface of ABAGs than those composed of a uniform reentrant
   pattern. Discrete Gaussian curvature at each node on a curved surface is
   computed for quantitatively evaluating the properties of shapes of the
   obtained surfaces. Possibility of ABAGs as a new design tool is
   demonstrated by showing that various shapes are generated through large
   deformation analysis with the forced displacements at the supports.}},

Title = {{Enhanced hexa-missing rib auxetics for achieving targeted constant NPR
   and in-plane isotropy at finite deformation}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The standard hexa-missing rib structure (i.e. missing rib structure with
   six zigzag ligaments) exhibits in-plane isotropy at small deformation,
   and has a relatively constant negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) over a
   finite deformation range. However, its auxeticity is relatively low, and
   the in-plane isotropy effect degrades rapidly with deformation. The
   present work aims to improve these two mechanical properties over a
   large deformation range, without significantly compromising the
   deformation range with constant NPR as well as the overall stiffness.
   First, the deformation mechanisms underlying a standard hexa-missing rib
   structure is elaborated. To enhance the auxeticity effect and to delay
   the loss of in-plane isotropy, an enhanced design with honeycomb
   reinforcement between the ligaments is proposed. By changing the size of
   the honeycomb reinforcement, the enhanced design is able to achieve
   tunable constant NPR ranging from -0.2 to -1.0 over a large deformation
   range, and yet maintaining its in-plane isotropy. Moreover, these
   enhanced properties are achieved without compromising the overall
   stiffness of the structure. Depending on the nature of engineering
   applications, the deformation range with a constant NPR can be further
   extended if desired, by having wavy connecting ligaments in the enhanced
   design. For the latter design, the structure is more compliant than the
   base design. It is shown that the target enhanced properties can be
   achieved over a large deformation range using linear elastic or
   nonlinear base materials.}},

Abstract = {{Rotating squares auxetic metamaterials have the peculiar feature of a
   negative Poisson's ratio. This work proposes and examines how an
   innovative variable arcs fillet solution, at the interconnection regions
   between the rotating units, improves the structural response of a
   titanium alloy-based rotating squares metamaterial. Through a 2D finite
   element (FE) model of the auxetic structure, we investigated and
   optimized two fillet configurations: first, a double circular arcs
   profile; second, a combined elliptical and circular arc fillet.
   According to the FE results, the optimal configuration of the combined
   elliptical and circular arc fillet allows an overall 3\% elastic strain
   of the metamaterial, with a Poisson's ratio (PR) equal to ca. -1. In
   order to assess the deformation behavior of the proposed metamaterial,
   we performed a tensile test on a prototype of the optimal solution, 3D
   printed in Onyx material. The experimental displacement field of the
   specimen, measured through digital image correlation, exhibited
   excellent agreement with the FE predictions, with a PR equal to ca. -1
   up to a 3\% overall strain.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Double arrowhead honeycombs (DAHs) are a type of auxetic materials,
   i.e., showing negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), and are promising for
   energy absorption applications. Their in-plane impact responses are
   theoretically and numerically explored. Theoretical models for the
   collapse stress under quasi-static, low-velocity, and high-velocity
   impacts are developed, based upon the corresponding microstructural
   deformation modes. Obtained results show that the collapse stress under
   quasi-static and low velocity impacts depends upon the two re-entrant
   angles responsible for NPR, while it is insensitive to them under
   high-velocity impact. The developed theoretical models are employed to
   analyze the energy absorption capacity of DAHs, showing the absorbed
   energy under high-velocity impact approximately proportional to the
   second power of velocity. Extension of the high-velocity impact model to
   functionally graded (FG) DAHs is also discussed. Good agreement between
   the theoretical and finite element (FE) predictions on the impact
   responses of DAHs is obtained.}},

   Poisson's ratios. In this paper, a new device for measuring out-of-plane

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with a negative Poisson's ratio show a unique lateral
   expansion under tension while their deformation under shear is similar
   to that of normal materials. Here, we present a novel method to design
   the stiffness of tubular structures by exploiting these load-dependent
   distinct deformation modes of auxetic materials. Auxetic cutting
   patterns are engraved on a tube whose bending and torsional stiffness
   values are predicted computationally for a comprehensive set of design
   parameters and measured experimentally for representative designs.
   Results demonstrate that a wide range of bending and torsional stiffness
   values can be effectively achieved and controlled independently. The
   proposed design principle is simple and powerful, and hence can be
   easily extended to design the mechanical properties of non-tubular
   structures as well. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-collision beam of front door has significant influence on occupant
   protection and side crashworthiness. In order to improve the
   comprehensive side impact performance of vehicle, this work proposes a
   novel negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) door anti-collision beam based on
   star-shaped cellular structural material, and optimizes it by a
   reliability-based optimization scheme. First, the parametric model of
   NPR anti-collision beam, vehicle model assembling NPR beam, occupant
   restraint system model and side collision model are established. Then,
   the basic mechanical properties of the NPR structure are investigated
   under considering the axial normal force, transverse shear force and
   bending moment of each rod, and the macro performance of NPR beam are
   analyzed. Next, a deterministic optimization integrating optimal Latin
   hypercube sampling (OLHS) method, response surface model (RSM) and
   NSGA-II algorithm is conducted to improve the performance of novel NPR
   beam. Finally, considering the uncertainties of design variables, a
   reliability-based optimization is further executed to enhance the
   robustness of the deterministic optimization by using Design for Six
   Sigma (DFSS) method. Simulation results show that the ultimate optimized
   NPR anti-collision beam can not only ameliorate driver's protection and
   side crashworthiness, but also ensure the reliability and lightweight

Abstract = {{In this study, the elastic behavior of the functionally graded
   cylindrically curved beam is analytically investigated. In the study, it
   is assumed that the modulus of elasticity varies along the thickness of
   the beam depending on the power law. Accordingly, by applying the
   general linear mixing law, other properties (thermal expansion
   coefficient; heat conduction coefficient, yield strength) vary according
   to the power law. Poisson's ratio remains constant. The temperature
   distribution applied to the beam varies with the thickness of the beam
   and as a function of the radial coordinate. The beam is assumed to be in
   the plane stress state. To determine the elastic behavior, von Mises
   yield criterion was used. Positive, negative and homogeneous
   temperatures were applied to the beam and the yielding was observed on
   the inner surface, the outer surface and at the same time on both
   surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Blast shock wave is a big threat to the military vehicle and may cause
   vehicle damages and passenger casualties. It is a big issue to balance
   the protective performance and lightweight property of military vehicle.
   In these days, many types of sandwich panels with different cores were
   applied as protective plates in military vehicles. In view of the
   excellent energy absorption capability of auxetic structure, applying
   auxetic structure as sandwich panel core for blast protection purpose is
   a promising field. However, existing in-plane configuration of
   two-dimensional auxetic honeycomb core always represent anisotropic
   behaviour. In this paper, a novel sandwich panel with three-dimensional
   double-V Auxetic (DVA) structure core, which can produce isotropic
   mechanical behavior, was proposed for air blast protection purpose. Its
   primary structural parameters and their relations were discussed, and a
   parametric numerical model was established. In order to reduce both the
   dynamic response under air blast loading and mass, the design variables
   and objective function of the DVA core optimization problem were
   confirmed, then parametric optimization was conducted based on Latin
   Hypercube Sampling (LHD) method, Gaussian process metamodel (GPM) and
   multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO). Finally,
   it is proved that the applied optimization process is efficient and can
   obtain accurate optimum points. The proposed DAV core sandwich panel
   performed much better both in lightweight and protection than solid
   plate and has an apparent merit in lightweight aspect compared with
   square honeycomb core sandwich panel.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{147}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Lightweight electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and impact
   attenuating materials are vital to protect delicate components in
   portable electronics. While conductive foams are intriguing for
   lightweight EMI shielding, their impact attenuating properties remain
   unexplored. Herein, a MXene/auxetic polyurethane (MX/ APU) composite
   foam is developed for multifunctional EMI shielding and impact
   attenuation. The MX/APU composite presents a superior EMI shielding
   effectiveness (SE) of 76.2 dB, 31.2\% higher than its non-auxetic
   counterpart at the same density owing to the larger specific surface
   area arising from the auxetic structure. Given its ultralow density of
   0.063 g cm-3, it yields a specific SE of 1210 dB cm3 g-1, placing it
   among the best candidates for lightweight applications. The negative
   Poisson's ratio of MX/APU composite foam also delivers
   multifunctionalities of impact attenuation, reducing the peak force by
   51.4\% compared to a non-auxetic foam. This work provides a conceptually
   new approach to design lightweight multifunctional materials using
   auxetic structures.}},

Title = {{Design of Self-Expanding Auxetic Stents Using Topology Optimization}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Implanting stents is the most efficient and minimally invasive technique
   for treating coronary artery diseases, but the risks of stent thrombosis
   (ST) and in-stent restenosis (IRS) hamper the healing process. There
   have been a variety of stents in market but dominated byad hocdesign
   motifs. A systematic design method that can enhance deliverability,
   safety and efficacy is still in demand. Most existing designs are
   focused on patient and biological factors, while the mechanical failures
   related to stenting architectures, e.g., inadequate stent expansion,
   stent fracture, stent malapposition and foreshortening, are often
   underestimated. With regard to these issues, the self-expanding (SE)
   stents may perform better than balloon-expandable (BE) stents, but the
   SE stents are not popular in clinic practice due to poor deliverability,
   placement accuracy, and precise match of the stent size and shape to the
   vessel. This paper addresses the importance between stent structures and
   clinic outcomes in the treatment of coronary artery disease. First, a
   concurrent topological optimization method will be developed to
   systematically find the best material distribution within the design
   domain. An extended parametric level set method with shell elements is
   proposed in the topology optimization to ensure the accuracy and
   efficiency of computations. Second, the auxetic metamaterial with
   negative Poisson's ratio is introduced into the self-expanding stents.
   Auxetics can enhance mechanical properties of structures, e.g., fracture
   toughness, indentation and shear resistance and vibration energy
   absorption, which will help resolve the drawbacks due to the mechanical
   failures. Final, the optimized SE stent is numerically validated with
   the commercial software ANSYS and then prototyped using additive
   manufacturing techniques. Topological optimization gives a rare
   opportunity to exploiting the unique advantages of additive
   manufacturing. Hence, the topologically optimized auxetic architectures
   will provide a new solution for developing novel stenting structures,
   especially conductive to self-expanding SE stents. The new design will
   overcome the limitations of conventional SE stents associated with
   mechanical structures while maintain their valuable features, to help
   reduce the occurrence of ST and ISR and benefit the clinic practice in
   treating coronary heart disease.}},

Title = {{What statistical method should be used to evaluate risk factors
   associated with dmfs index? Evidence from the National Pathfinder Survey
   of 4-year-old Italian children}},
Journal = {{COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{P>Background:
   Traditional approaches to the analysis of dmfs/DMFS count data pose
   analytical challenges, considering the increasing proportion of zeroes
   in the distribution. The aim of this paper was to predict the
   probability of `caries-free' subjects and the dependence of dmfs index
   on the influence of childhood sociodemographic factors, through the
   application of regression models.
   Methods:
   Data were gathered as part of the National Pathfinder Survey of
   4-year-old Italian children. Clinical data on caries disease (dmfs) and
   childhood sociodemographic factors were collected. The predicted
   probability for Poisson, negative binomial and zero-inflated models
   (Poisson and negative binomial) were estimated using STATA commands for
   count outcomes. The outcome variable in the regression models was the
   severity of the disease (dmfs index), while statistically significant
   variables on bivariate analysis were considered as covariates.
   Results:
   Out of 5538 children, 4344 (78.44\%) had a dmfs = 0. The mean dmfs index
   was 1.36 (range: 0-104). The statistical significance of the dispersion
   parameter (O = 141.6, P < 0.0001) showed the inappropriateness of the
   Poisson model when compared with the negative binomial model. Vuong's
   test indicated that the zero-inflated models (ZIP and ZINB) fitted the
   data significantly better than the others (P < 0.001). A significative
   likelihood ratio statistic indicates that the ZINB regression model
   fitted better than ZIP model (P < 0.0001). The father's educational
   level was significant in both parts of the ZINB regression model (P <
   0.05), implying that the degree of caries experience increases in
   children whose fathers have a low level of education, while the excess
   of caries-free children decreases. Moreover, the increase of
   coefficients in the zero-inflated part of ZINB regression model implies
   that the excess of caries-free subjects increases with the later age of
   tooth eruption. The observed underestimation of the frequencies of zero
   dmfs counts by the Poisson model is a common result when a dual-group
   process is not taken into account.
   Conclusions:
   These regression models provide a useful approach to handling count
   outcomes as dmfs/DMFS index in caries epidemiology.}},

   contact profiles. Poisson's ration was varied within the theoretically
   acceptable for the isotropic elastic medium values. The analogous
   calculations were performed for a joint with a deformed element made of
   anisotropic auxetic composite whose reinforcement angle was varied as a
   factor of elastic constants. The nonlinear dependencies of the maximum
   pressure, tangential stress and slippage were obtained as a function of
   Poission's ratio (in the isotropic case) and reinforcement angle of the

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibiting a negative Poisson's ratio are of great
   research interest due to their unusual mechanical responses and a wide

   novel 2D and 3D auxetic structures through rational design,
   optimization, and taking inspiration from nature. Here we report a 3D
   architected lattice system showing a negative Poisson's ratio over a
   wide range of applied uniaxial stretch. 3D printing, experimental tests,
   numerical simulation, and analytical modeling are implemented to
   quantify the evolution of the Poisson's ratio and reveal the underlying
   mechanisms responsible for this unusual behavior. We further show that
   the auxetic behavior can be controlled by tailoring the geometric
   features of the ligaments. The findings reported here provide a new
   routine to design architected metamaterial systems exhibiting unusual
   properties and having a wide range of potential applications.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are characterized with counter intuitive mechanical
   behavior, that is, a negative Poisson's ratio, in which the material
   expands in the direction perpendicular to the elongation direction. This
   intriguing property can be used to engineer structures with various
   porosity for `smart filters' where the permeability changes in response
   to exterior force. In this research, the mechanical behavior of braided
   tubular structures that comprise helical auxetic yarns (HAYs) has been
   investigated. The permeability of the structure can be altered with the
   application of different levels of tensile force. Both HAYs and biaxial
   structures are fabricated on a Maypole braiding machine. The novelty of
   this braided tubular structure is that its open area decreases when
   stretched due to the local auxetic effect. A multi-scale finite element
   model is established to analyze the auxetic effect and the relationship
   between tensile force and the open area. The open area of the biaxial
   structure is measured by a camera system that is installed next to an
   Instron machine while the sample is subjected to tension. The
   experimental results show that the open area in the biaxial structure is
   reduced due to the auxetic effect of each HAY. The model gives a
   reasonable prediction compared to the experimental data, even though
   deviation exists, which is probably due to the nonlinear behavior from
   contact and large deformation.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-derived macroscopic assemblies feature hierarchical nano-and
   microstructures that provide numerous routes for surface and interfacial
   functionalization achieving unconventional material properties. We
   report that the microstructural hierarchy of pristine chemically
   modified graphene films, featuring wrinkles, delamination of
   close-packed laminates, their ordered and disordered stacks, renders
   remarkable negative Poisson's ratios ranging from -0.25 to -0.55. The
   mechanism proposed is validated by the experimental characterization and
   theoretical analysis. Based on the understanding of microstructural
   origins, pre-strech is applied to endow chemically modified graphene
   films with controlled negative Poisson's ratios. Modulating the wavy
   textures of the inter-connected network of close-packed laminates in the
   chemically modified graphene films also yields finely-tuned negative
   Poisson's ratios. These findings offer the key insights into rational
   design of films constructed from two-dimensional materials with negative

Abstract = {{Measurements have been carried out on the in-plane and through the

   reproducible results obtained. It is confirmed that in-plane negative
   values may be obtained in specific directions. The physical reason for
   this and its connection with the necessary appearance of a large Poisson
   ratio is pointed out. The expansivity of the matrix material depends
   strongly on temperature. Very good agreement between the experimental
   values and those predicted from the properties of the two constituents
   is found provided that the value for the expansivity of the
   polyoropylene is that within the temperature range considered. It is
   shown that the polypropylene matrix does not provide a matrix which is
   stable enough in its properties to enable the system to yield consistent
   negative values of expansivity. An alternative system is proposed and a
   single experiment confirms that a negative value of the thermal
   expansivity of as large as -50 x 10(-6) K-1 may be obtained. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{This study compares fabrication methods for auxetic foam intended for
   use in sports safety equipment. Thermo-mechanical conversion methods
   were applied using: i) cubic moulds (150x150x150 mm), ii) cuboidal
   moulds (150x150x30 mm) \& iii) cuboidal moulds (150x150x30 mm) with
   through-thickness pins. The cuboidal moulds having one reduced dimension
   relative to the cubic moulds enable faster heat transfer and more
   consistent through-thickness compression to the foam during conversion.
   The through-thickness pins allow greater control of in-plane compression
   throughout the bulk of the converted foam. Samples were compared using:
   i) density measurements and measurements of total surface folding
   (length multiplied by depth), ii) quasi-static compressive load/unload
   tests to obtain specific strain energy, stress/strain relationship and
   Poisson's ratio, iii) impact testing on a bespoke drop rig based on a
   standard for cricket pads (BS 6183-3: 2000, EN 2001) at 5, 10 and 15 J
   \& iv) microscopic images of dissected samples to confirm their auxetic
   (re-entrant) structure. Samples fabricated in cuboidal moulds show less
   variation in final density, axial compressive stiffness and specific
   strain energy between samples than those cut from monoliths fabricated
   in cubic moulds. Samples created with through-thickness pins exhibited
   reduced surface folding. Greater control over final properties paves the
   way for further work designing auxetic foams for sport safety equipment.

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is, for specified directions, the ratio of a lateral
   contraction to the longitudinal extension during the stretching of a
   material. Although a negative Poisson's ratio (that is, a lateral
   extension in response to stretching) is not forbidden by
   thermo-dynamics, this property is generally believed to be rare in
   crystalline solids(1). In contrast to this belief, 69\% of the cubic
   elemental metals have a negative Poisson's ratio when stretched along
   the {[}110] direction. For these metals, we find that correlations exist
   between the work function and the extremal values or Poisson's ratio for
   this stretch direction, which we explain using a simple electron-gas
   model. Moreover, these negative Poisson's ratios permit the existence,
   in the orthogonal lateral direction, of positive Poisson's ratios up to
   the stability Limit of 2 for cubic crystals. Such metals having negative
   Poisson's ratios may find application as electrodes that amplify the
   response of piezoelectric sensors.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{To improve the auxeticity and isotropy behavior of standard hexachiral
   structures at large elasto-plastic deformation, the authors have earlier
   proposed a modified hexachiral structure with wavy ligaments (Zhu et al
   2018 Smart Material Structures 27 055001). While a significant
   improvement was achieved with the proposed modified chiral structure, it
   was reported therewith that its auxeticity and isotropy degrade rapidly
   at large tensile deformation, in contrast to the excellent performance
   in compression. The present work builds upon the basic structure
   proposed in (Zhu et al 2018 Smart Material Structures 27 055001), to
   further improve the mechanical behavior in tension, without compromising
   the already excellent performance achieved at large compressive
   deformation. To reduce the distortion of the central ring in a
   hexachiral structure-the deformation mechanism that degrades its
   mechanical performance in tension-a hierarchical hexachiral structure is

Abstract = {{Five transverse rod (TR)-containing main-chain liquid crystalline
   polymers (LCPs) are examined in both the powder and fiber forms by wide
   angle X-ray diffraction. Data from the diffraction experiments are
   consistent with the site-connectivity-driven TR-reorientation mechanism
   for intrinsic auxetic character in these macromolecules. Shifts in peak
   maxima, intensity distributions in the interchain interaction region,
   and calculated volume increase accompanying fiber formation are all in
   line with expectations from considerations of this mechanism. The narrow
   window for experimental conditions necessary for fiber preparation and
   subsequent X-ray observation of this phenomenon is detailed. A close
   examination of space-filling Corey-Pauling-Koltun (CPK) molecular models
   reveals the details of local packing of rods and connected polymer
   chains in the quiescent nematic polymer melt prior to fiber drawing. It
   is found that two rod-reorientation possibilities exist each of which
   leads to increased interchain separation as required for auxetic
   response. Suggestions for future experiments and materials design for
   new LCPs are described.}},

Title = {{Fabrication of multi-scale and tunable auxetic scaffolds for tissue
   engineering}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{197}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Melt electro writing (MEW) provides three-dimensional (3D) printing
   porous scaffolds with well-defined geometrical features of ultrafine
   fibers in the tissue engineering. Scaffolds with adjustable Poisson's
   ratio are more suitable in certain biological applications for mimicking
   the behavior of native tissue mechanics. However, it is still a
   challenging issue to tune the Poisson's ratio. In order to resolve this
   problem, a new method is proposed in the present study to design and
   fabricate tunable auxetic scaffolds through altering the printing
   configurations in the MEW. Patterns with thick fibers are designed using
   specific geometries and then these patterns are utilized to tune the
   Poisson's ratio based on the intended deformation mechanism. Moreover,
   the electrospun thin fibers are used to fill the unit cell of auxetic
   lattice structures for promoting the cell growth. Investigating the
   mechanical characteristics of the fabricated scaffolds demonstrates that
   the Poisson's ratio of the scaffold can be effectively tuned.
   Furthermore, cell sense and response to the fabricated scaffolds are
   studied. Obtained results indicate that the proposed approach can
   potentially be applied in a wide variety of biomedical applications. (c)

Abstract = {{Auxetic scaffolds, that is, scaffolds that can display negative
   Poisson's ratio, have unique physical properties and can expand
   transversally when axially strained or contract under compression.
   Auxetic materials have been used for bioprostheses and artery stents due
   to the enhanced compressive strength and shear stiffness. In vascular
   tissue engineering, auxetic scaffolds allow the widening of blood
   vessels when blood flows through (creating compressive stress) to
   prevent the blockage. However, the influence of auxetic materials on the
   cellular fate decision in local environment is unclear. In this study,
   auxetic polyurethane foams were used to support vascular differentiation
   from pluripotent stem cells. The expression of alkaline phosphatase,
   Oct-4, and Nanog was lower after 4days of differentiation for the cells
   grown in auxetic scaffolds. Higher expression of vascular markers CD31
   and VE-cadherin was observed for the cells from auxetic scaffolds
   compared with those from the scaffolds before auxetic conversion. Little
   influence on the expression of cardiac marker -actinin was observed. The
   vascular cells secreted extracellular matrix proteins vitronectin and
   laminin and expressed membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase 9. The
   examination of Yes-associated protein expression indicated more
   cytoplasmic retention in the cells from auxetic scaffolds compared with
   those from regular scaffolds, suggesting that the auxetic scaffolds may
   affect cellular contraction. This study demonstrates a novel 3-D culture
   based on auxetic scaffolds for vascular differentiation and provides a
   platform to study the influence of biophysical microenvironments on
   differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. The outcome of this study has
   implications for regenerative medicine and drug discovery.}},

Title = {{Production and optimization of eco-bricks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{266}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Waste plastics are often indiscriminately disposed into the built
   environment and sometimes voyaged into the sea, constitute nuisance to
   the built environment and disturb aquatic life. These threats have
   birthed researches for the promotion of circular economy in plastic
   waste management. However, few studies have investigated the use of
   waste plastic in the production of eco-bricks. This study examined the
   effect of moisture content and soil types on the characterisation of
   eco-bricks under compressive load. Samples of eco-bricks were produced
   using laterite, sharp sand and stone dust at 0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 15\% and
   20\% moisture contents as infill materials. The soil samples were tested
   of specific gravity, fineness modulus and uniformity coefficient
   computation to determine the suitability of the samples, while the
   eco-bricks produced with the soil samples were subjected to compressive
   load. The study found a positive relationship between soil moisture
   content and compressive strength of eco-bricks produced with sharp sand
   and stone dust while the compressive strength of laterite bottle bricks
   had a negative relationship with the moisture content. Also, the
   specific strength, Poisson's ratio and bulk density of the eco-bricks
   were satisfactory at varying soil moisture contents. The study concludes
   that soil moisture content affects the performance of bottle bricks and
   adequate consideration for soil types in the production of eco-bricks is
   paramount. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are one of the metamaterials that have potential
   applications in many scientific and engineering fields. In this paper,
   an investigation is presented on the postbuckling responses of axially
   loaded graphene reinforced metal matrix composite (GRMMC) laminated
   cylindrical panels with in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The
   panels are made of GRMMC laminates and rest on an elastic foundation in
   thermal environments. The graphene volume fraction in GRMMC layer may
   vary across the panel thickness in order to achieve a piece-wise
   functionally graded (FG) pattern. The GRMMC layers have in-plane NPR and
   temperature dependent material properties. The governing differential
   equations for the GRMMC laminated cylindrical panels are formulated
   based on the Reddy's third order shear deformation shell theory and are
   solved by using a singular perturbation technique along with a two-step
   perturbation approach. Numerical investigation is carried out to study
   the influence of the in-plane NPR, the FG patterns, the thermal
   environmental conditions and the foundation stiffness on the
   postbuckling responses of the GRMMC laminated cylindrical panels under
   axial compressive load. The results reveal that the in-plane NPR can
   lead to a substantial change of the postbuckling behaviors of the GRMMC

Abstract = {{Protecting building, critical infrastructure and military vehicles from
   Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) has become a critical task. This
   study aims to examine the performance of a new protective system
   utilizing auxetic honeycomb-cored sandwich panels for mitigation of
   shock loads from close-in and contact detonations of high explosives.
   Both field blast tests and drop weight tests were performed using the
   proposed sandwiches as a shield for concrete panels in combination with
   conventional steel protective plates. The combined shield was found to
   be effective in protecting reinforced concrete structures against severe
   impact and close-in blast loadings. The honeycomb core with re-entrant
   hexagonal cells shows evident auxetic characteristics which contribute
   substantially to outstanding force mitigation and blast-resistance
   performances of such sandwich panels. Numerical simulations showed good
   agreement with the experimental results. The proposed auxetic panels
   were found to perform better than conventional honeycomb panels of the
   same size, areal density and material. Both were found to boost the
   energy absorption of the monolithic steel plate by a factor of 2.5 by
   changing its deformation pattern under close-in blast loading. In
   addition, a combination of the steel plate and an auxetic sandwich panel
   has aerial specific energy absorption (ASEA) higher than either of them,
   showing great potential for the development of lightweight blast
   protection of civil, mining, military, nuclear infrastructure and
   vehicles. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rationally designed artificial materials providing unusual mechanical
   properties are attracting continuous interests due to the wide
   technological applications such as metamaterials for flexible electron
   and biomedical devices. A variety of natural biological tissues exhibit
   ``J-shaped{''} stress-strain behavior, so a challenge and interesting
   subject is to offer protection to electronics from a certain strain that
   may induce potential device failures. In the current letter, a novel
   porous auxetic metamaterial with ``J-shaped{''} stress-strain curve is
   designed and a method for tuning Poisson's ratio and stress-strain curve
   is illustrated. Experimental tests, numerical simulations, and
   analytical modeling are implemented to quantify the evolution of the
   Poisson's ratio and stress-strain curve, revealing the underlying
   mechanisms responsible for the unusual behavior. The structure
   simultaneously shows elastic wave bandgaps at certain frequency, which
   can finally extend to three-dimension. The designed structural
   metamaterial has potential for applications in tissue engineering,
   bio-medical devices, and comfortable integration of stretchable
   electronics with biological tissues, it also provides a new routine to
   design architected metamaterial systems exhibiting desired properties.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the tensile deformation behavior of an auxetic
   warp-knitted spacer fabric structure by using the finite element (FE)
   method. The precise geometry of the outer layer structure of the fabric
   was firstly obtained from a micro X-ray computerized tomography scan and
   then inputted to an ANSYS 13.0 software to generate geometrical models.
   The geometrical models were then meshed using the PLANE 183 element to
   build FE models. Based on the FE models built, deformation behaviors of
   the auxetic fabric in the course direction and wale direction were
   simulated and compared with experimental results. The FE analysis showed
   that the simulated fabric deformations at different tensile strains were
   very close to the real fabric deformations and the FE-generated
   Poisson's ratio-strain curves agreed well with the experimental ones.
   Therefore, the FE models could be used for predicting the deformation
   behaviors of the auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabric stretched in
   different fabric plane directions.}},

   graphene networks}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) graphene networks (3DGNs) have drawn broad
   interest recently for their superior physical properties, such as large
   surface area, high strength, superelasticity, tunable band gaps and
   topological properties, with potential applications in high-capacity
   energy storage and novel electronic systems. In this work, giant
   negative Poisson ratios (NPRs) up to -8.5 and colossal auxetic
   transverse contraction (or expansion) of more than 40\% (or 20\%) in
   3DGNs are predicted by first-principles calculations, adding another
   extraordinary mechanical property to 3DGNs. A mechanism dominated by
   sp(3)-carbon bond angle distortion and in-plane anisotropy variation is
   revealed that can explain such exceptional NPRs in 3DGNs. Furthermore,
   easy manipulation and enhancement of NPRs are achieved by applying
   biaxial stresses which increase the in-plane anisotropy of 3DGNs,
   providing a way for the rational design and application of NPR
   materials. These discoveries will deepen our understandings of 3DGNs and
   broaden their technological applications as multifunctional materials.}},

Title = {{Evolutionary topology optimization for mechanical metamaterials with
   auxetic property}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials with auxetic property have attracted a lot of
   attention in both the computational intelligence and engineering
   applications. However, the works relate to the efficient Bi-directional
   evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method is infrequent due to
   the discrete nature of design variables. This paper obtains the
   orthotropic materials with auxetic property by imposing two numerical
   strategies on the sensitivity calculation and variable updating, which
   are used to stabilize the evolutionary process and easy to be
   implemented. In addition, this paper develops a robust objective
   function while taking into account of the mechanical properties in all
   directions of the material microstructure, and the explicit sensitivity
   information of the objective function with respect to design variables
   is derived, then the powerful OC-type algorithm is adopted to solve this
   problem. The macroscopic equivalent elastic behavior is evaluated by the
   comprehensible energy-based homogenization method (EBHM). Several
   numerical examples are tested to demonstrate the feasibility and
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for the design of orthotropic
   materials with auxetic properties. Finally, two experiments are arranged
   to further illustrate the effect of negative Poisson's ratio of the
   designed material microstructures.}},

Title = {{Shape optimization of bowtie-shaped auxetic structures using beam theory}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{224}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic structures with a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are known for
   their novel mechanical properties. Recent studies have shown that these
   properties can be tailored using numerical simulations based on the
   finite element method where plane or solid elements are applied,
   combined with optimization techniques. However, an optimization
   procedure based on beam theory, which is expected to be more
   computationally efficient than the prevalent plane or solid element
   formulations, has not been developed thus far. In this paper, we propose
   a nonlinear beam theory-based model discretized by the Ritz method for
   the optimum design of bowtie-shaped auxetic structures. For a systematic
   design process, effective stiffness, NPR, maximum stress, and volume are
   defined as the main performance indices. Two design parameters, namely,
   the initial shape of the centerline and the thickness profile
   represented by B-spline curves, are used to maximize the performance of
   the system. Our study confirmed that auxetic structures can be tailored
   to yield a minimum value of the NPR, stress, and volume without the loss
   of effective stiffness. 3D-printed prototypes were tested to verify the
   accuracy of the proposed model and the optimality of the design.}},

Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have recently emerged as new types of advanced
   materials with unique material properties that conventional materials do
   not possess. In this paper, we examine the effect of in-plane negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) on the thermal postbuckling behavior of
   graphene-reinforced metal matrix composite (GRMMC) laminated cylindrical
   shells. The shell consists of GRMMC layers arranged in a piece-wise
   functionally graded (FG) pattern and is subjected to a uniform thermal
   load surrounded by an elastic medium. Based on the molecular dynamics
   simulation results, it is noted that the temperature-dependent material
   properties of GRMMCs can be expressed as a nonlinear function of
   temperature. The thermal postbuckling problem of shells is modeled under
   the framework of the Reddy's third order shear deformation theory and
   solved by using a singular perturbation technique in conjunction with a
   two-step perturbation approach. Numerical investigations are carried out
   for the postbuckling of (10/-10/10/-10/10)(S) and (10/-10/10)(S) shells
   with in-plane NPR. It is found that the FG-X pattern can enhance the
   buckling temperature and the thermal postbuckling strength of the
   shells. The anomaly is that the thermal buckling load and postbuckling
   strength of UD (10/-10/10)(S) shell are slightly higher than those of UD
   (10/-10/10/-10/10)(S) GRMMC laminated cylindrical shell. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is one of the key parameters of material properties, and
   it could directly decide deformation and distribution of stress in
   materials and structures. In this paper, effects of Poisson's ratio on
   static mechanical behaviours of functionally graded structure are
   investigated in three different kinds of elastic models. Configurations
   of unit cell and finite element (FE) models are utilized to analyze
   macro cellular structures under static compression loads. The properties
   of graphite sheet structure in micro-nano scaled structures are
   calculated. The unit cell varies from hexagonal to re-entrant
   configurations while Poisson's ratio varies from positive to negative
   values gradually. The combined Fourier series-Galerkin method is
   introduced to solve beam structure subjected to transverse loads. In the
   numerical results, it is found that Poisson's ratio exhibits appreciable
   effects on bearing capacity, which indicates static properties can be
   improved by optimal design of cell shape material distribution and
   computational methodology.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the nonlinear bending behavior of sandwich
   plates with functionally graded auxetic 3D lattice core. First and
   foremost, an auxetic 3D lattice metamaterial with negative effective
   Poisson's ratio (EPR) is designed and examined via theoretical and
   finite element methods with experimental verifications using specimens
   fabricated by 3D printing. Furthermore, three functionally graded
   configurations of the auxetic 3D lattice core through the plate
   thickness direction are proposed and compared with the uniform
   distribution case. Full-scale finite element modeling and nonlinear
   thermal-mechanical analysis are performed for the sandwich plates, with
   the temperature-dependent material properties of both core and face
   sheets taken into account. Numerical results revealed that the auxetic
   core can remarkably reduce the lateral deflections, with comparison to
   their non-auxetic counterpart with positive EPR. Parametric studies are
   further carried out to demonstrate the effects of functionally graded
   configurations, temperature rises, facesheet-to-core thickness ratios,
   boundary conditions, and strut radii on the nonlinear bending
   load-deflection curves, along with EPR-deflection curves in the large
   deflection region.}},

Abstract = {{All of the thermal and elastic constants of the high-aspect ratio,
   negative, UV resist, SU8 coating were carried out, and the compliance
   matrix of the coating was obtained. DSC, TGA, TMA, and DMTA techniques
   were utilized to study the thermal properties of the material. The
   in-plane thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) (alpha(1)) was determined
   by TMA, and the glass transition behavior was studied by DMTA. The TGA
   study provided information about the thermal stability of the material,
   and DSC was applied to study the thermal calorimetric properties of the
   material. The in-plane Young's modulus (E-1) was measured by tensile
   tests. The residual stresses of a 1D stretched ribbon sample and a 2D
   stretched membrane sample were measured by vibrational holography tests,
   and the in-plane Poisson's ratio (nu(1)) was also determined by
   holography. The out-of-plane Poisson's ratio (nu(2)) was obtained by
   high pressure gas dilatometry measurements. The bulk compressibility
   (kappa) and the volumetric TEC (alpha(v)) of the material were measured
   by a pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) apparatus. Finally, the
   out-of-plane properties, including the out-of-plane TEC (alpha(2)) and
   the out-of-plane Young's modulus (E-2), were calculated from the
   measured in-plane properties and the volumetric properties. Therefore,
   the compliance matrix of the studied SU8 coating could be obtained. (C)

   previous papers and the results can be taken over quite readily. Among
   the result it is reported that networks of beams that are stubby auxetic

Abstract = {{It appears that most models for micro-structured materials with auxetic
   deformations were found by clever intuition, possibly combined with
   optimization tools, rather than by systematic searches of existing
   structure archives. Here we review our recent approach of finding
   micro-structured materials with auxetic mechanisms within the vast
   repositories of planar tessellations. This approach has produced two
   previously unknown auxetic mechanisms, which have Poisson's ratio v(ss)
   = -1 when realized as a skeletal structure of stiff incompressible
   struts pivoting freely at common vertices. One of these, baptized
   Triangle-Square Wheels, has been produced as a linear-elastic cellular
   structure from Ti-6Al-4V alloy by selective electron beam melting. Its
   linear-elastic properties were measured by tensile experiments and yield
   an effective Poisson's ratio v(LE) approximate to -0.75, also in
   agreement with finite element modeling. The similarity between the
   Poisson's ratios v(SS) of the skeletal structure and v(LE) of the
   linear-elastic cellular structure emphasizes the fundamental role of
   geometry for deformation behavior, regardless of the mechanical details
   of the system. The approach of exploiting structure archives as
   candidate geometries for auxetic materials also applies to spatial
   networks and tessellations and can aid the quest for inherently
   three-dimensional auxetic mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we examine the impact behavior of single and doubly curved
   structures with auxetic cores by using numerical methods. We have
   evaluated twelve different doubly and one single curved panels impacted
   by a spherical projectile at a velocity of 100 m/s. The results are
   firstly discussed by considering the effects of the curvature on the
   backplane displacement and the energy absorption of the panels. A
   selected toroidal configuration is then modeled as sandwich structure
   with an auxetic (re-entrant) core and a spherical projectile is shot on
   different locations from center to edge. The sandwich structure is made
   by carbon fiber/epoxy laminates, while the re-entrant core is
   represented with ABSplus plastic. It is found that the damaged area of
   the auxetic core differs from a traditional honeycomb under impact
   loading, and this is mainly due to its negative Poisson's ratio.}},

   impact on the environment, due to the problems related to recycling and
   disposal of the rubber waste. However, adding waste tyres as a
   dispersive phase in polymeric composites has shown high toughness and
   moderate increase of mechanical strength within the composites. In this
   work, we investigate the use of recycled rubber core to manufacture
   auxetic (re-entrant) honeycomb structures. The re-entarnt honeycombs
   produced are evaluated using finite element analysis and tensile
   in-plane to assess the sensitivity of the mechanical properties versus
   the cell geometric parameters. A full factorial design (33) was
   performed to investigate the effects of the factors width (10 and
   20?mm), thickness (2 and 4?mm) and angle (-10 and -20 degrees) on
   Poisson's ratio of honeycomb structures. The results give further
   evidence that the Poisson's ratio is affected not only by individual
   factors but also by interaction originated by the other geometric
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Diamond-like carbon nanostructures with cubic anisotropy made by joining
   fullerene-like molecules of different types via valence bonds are
   studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations. The considered
   structures are interesting because they include both sp(2)- and
   sp(3)-hybridized carbon atoms, which lead to their distinct properties
   compared to the structures with one type of hybridization. Seven
   diamond-like carbon phases having different shapes of structural units
   and/or different ways of their connection are studied in the present
   work. For the relaxed equilibrium structures, the engineering elastic
   constants (Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and shear modulus) are
   calculated as the functions of the crystal orientation angles. Extreme
   values of the elastic constants are reported. It is shown that two of
   the considered diamond-like structures have negative Poisson's ratio and
   can be regarded as the partial auxetics. According to the results of the
   present study, elastic properties of the bulk diamond-like carbon
   structures can vary considerably depending on their structure. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The computational design of a composite where the properties of its
   constituents change gradually within a unit cell can be successfully
   achieved by means of a material design method that combines topology
   optimization with homogenization. This is an iterative numerical method,
   which leads to changes in the composite material unit cell until desired
   properties (or performance) are obtained. Such method has been applied
   to several types of materials in the last few years. In this work, the
   objective is to extend the material design method to obtain functionally
   graded material architectures, i.e. materials that are graded at the
   local level (e.g. microstructural level). Consistent with this goal, a
   continuum distribution of the design variable inside the finite element
   domain is considered to represent a fully continuous material variation
   during the design process. Thus the topology optimization naturally
   leads to a smoothly graded material system. To illustrate the
   theoretical and numerical approaches, numerical examples are provided.
   The homogenization method is verified by considering one-dimensional
   material gradation profiles for which analytical solutions for the
   effective elastic properties are available. The verification of the
   homogenization method is extended to two dimensions considering a
   trigonometric material gradation, and a material variation with
   discontinuous derivatives. These are also used as benchmark examples to
   verify the optimization method for functionally graded material cell
   design. Finally the influence of material gradation on extreme materials
   is investigated, which includes materials with near-zero shear modulus,
   and materials with negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Title = {{Combined analytical and numerical approach for auxetic FG-CNTRC plate
   subjected to a sudden load}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING WITH COMPUTERS}},
Abstract = {{In the current work, the dynamic behavior of functionally graded carbon
   nanotube-reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC) plate with negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) is investigated by combining higher-order shear deformation
   theory and large deflection theory. First, explicit solutions are
   proposed to predict the effective Poisson's ratio (EPR) of the
   laminates. Taking carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) as an
   example, the maximum NPR is obtained for (+/-theta)(3T) laminate as
   well. Results show that the EPR (v(13)(e), v(23)(e)) can range from a
   positive value of 0.311 to a negative value of 0.63. For the dynamic
   response problem, the asymptotic solutions with a two-step perturbation
   approach are derived for FG-CNTRC plates to capture the relationship
   between the center deflection and time. Several key factors such as
   functionally graded distribution, variations in the elastic foundation,
   and thermal stress produced by changing the temperature field are
   considered in the subsequent analysis. Numerical simulations are carried
   out to examine the corresponding dynamic behavior of FG-CNTRC plates
   when these factors are taken into account.}},

   Thermochemical analysis based on homodesmotic reactions showed that the

   polytriangulane and comparable to that of polytwistane. A plane-wave DFT
   approach gave a computed Young's modulus of about 0.84 TPa, which is
   quite promising and comparable to those of other sp(3)-hybridized
   nanothreads. Simulations of the desorption of hydrogen atoms from PA
   showed a high activation energy (E-a approximate to 52kcalmol(-1)),
   which again indicates substantial chemical stability. Interestingly, PA

Abstract = {{Auxetic composites are one of novel metamaterials which exhibit an
   interesting feature of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The current study
   reports the impact of in-plane NPR on the postbuckling responses of
   axially loaded cylindrical shells made of graphene-reinforced metal
   matrix composite (GRMMC) layers. Each layer of a GRMMC laminated
   cylindrical shell can vary its graphene volume fraction so that a
   functionally graded (FG) shell is achieved. The GRMMC layers possess
   temperature-dependent material properties that can be evaluated using an
   extended micromechanical Halpin-Tsai model. The governing equations for
   the postbuckling of GRMMC laminated shells are based on the Reddy's
   third order shear deformation theory. The von Karman nonlinear
   strain-displacement relationships together with the foundation support
   and temperature effects are also included. Analytical solutions are
   obtained by using a singular perturbation technique in associate with a
   two-step perturbation approach for the postbuckling of perfect and
   imperfect FG-GRMMC laminated cylindrical shells. Numerical results
   explicitly show that the in-plane NPR has a substantial effect on the
   postbuckling response and imperfection sensitivity of GRMMC laminated
   cylindrical shells under axial compression.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the basic geometric and kinematic characteristics of

   family of new possible forms. We investigate and elaborate auxetic
   behavior in a purely geometric way which is based on the kinematic
   movement of different frameworks. We then demonstrate its usefulness by
   analyzing the involved geometry with computer software but without
   computer simulations or numerical approximations. Instead, using cut
   flat material and, depending on the cuts and the material used, we
   enable the kinematical movement of the structures. We also analyze
   monostable auxetic structures whose movements can be described as
   geometrically precise, as well as bistable ones. Based on geometric
   considerations, we combine rigid materials and composites and select
   appropriate joint connections to allow the application of this system in
   an architectural scale in, for example, facades, screens or shading

Abstract = {{Second-order solutions for the pure bending of a beam under finite
   deformation are obtained in this paper. The equilibrium equations are
   solved analytically for the second-order displacements, from which the
   first Piola-Kirchhoff stresses, the curvatures and a bending-stretching
   parameter are calculated for a cross section with a transverse axis of
   symmetry. The displacements are dependent on the square of the inverse
   of elastic constant, whereas the stresses on the inverse of elastic
   constant. The curvatures and anticlastic curvatures are gradated in the
   transverse direction. The longitudinal stress is nonlinearly distributed
   across the section, and exhibits anomalous characteristics in materials
   with a negative Poisson's ratio. The shear stresses have vanishing force
   and moment resultants, and bending-twisting coupling does not occur. The
   normal stresses give rise to force-couple resultants. The longitudinal
   force resultant representing the bending-stretching effect is dependent
   on a reduced elastic parameter xi. This effect is present as long as
   there is finite deformation, even if the material is linearly elastic. A
   small shear modulus mu and/or a large third-order elastic constant l, m
   or n will result in a large xi. This study may be applicable to the
   elasticity design of soft medical and wearable robots, where elastic
   compatibility with tissues is a primary consideration. (C) 2019 Elsevier

   first-order stiffness terms. For a homogenization technique, discrete

Abstract = {{Materials and structures with auxetic and negative linear
   compressibility are of great potential to be used in many applications
   because of their uncommon mechanical deformation features. However,
   their design and manufacture are less studied as compared to other
   mechanical properties. The aim of this research is to explore several
   new approaches relating to the design and fabrication of cellular
   materials and structures with these two uncommon features. For most
   cellular materials and structures, these uncommon properties only exist
   for a limited geometric range. To begin with, the geometric limit of the
   microstructure of a 2D elastomer-based auxetic material was identified
   numerically through large deformation analysis. Within the geometric
   limits, a tuning method was developed further to control their
   mechanical properties with prescribed performance constraints. A
   metallic auxetic metamaterial was used as an example of the developed
   tuning approach, and its effectiveness was validated by experimental
   results with specimens manufactured using 3D printing technique. To
   reduce the manufacturing cost using 3D printing, a composite approach
   was proposed to manufacture these metamaterials. Several new cellular
   composite structures with negative linear compressibility composite
   structures were used as examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   design approach. The test samples were manufactured using the
   traditional composite method with low cost. These investigations
   mentioned above have clearly demonstrated the feasibility of designing
   and manufacturing of mechanical metamaterials using the presented
   approaches and laid the foundation for the expansion of their potential
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Today, the human being endeavors to manufacture devices and materials
   capable of doing something in an intelligent way. Shape memory polymers
   are a series of smart materials, capable of retrieving their original
   shape from a temporary form by applying external stimuli, for example,
   heat, electricity, magnetism, light, pH, and humidity. In this research,
   the behavior of temperature-sensitive shape memory polymer-based
   structures with positive and negative Poisson's ratio has been analyzed.
   The purpose is the material design of smart structures with tunable
   Poisson's ratio using topology optimization. In this study, a
   meta-structure is designed, which is made by a smart material. Not only
   does this structure have shape memory effects, but also it has negative
   Poisson's ratio, which can be used in new sensors, actuators, and
   biomedical applications. After creation of the unit cell and the
   representative volume element and formation of final three-dimensional
   structure, finite element modeling is conducted based on a
   thermo-visco-hyperelastic constitutive model at large deformations.
   Examining the behavior of structures in tensile pre-strains of 20\%,
   10\%, and 5\%, it is observed that pre-strain has no considerable effect
   on Poisson's ratio, but under compressive strain of 20\%, it is
   concluded that the type of loading is effective on Poisson's ratio and
   the results are different in tension and compression modes. Finally, the
   influence of temperature rate on the behavior of structures is
   inspected, and it is concluded that the more slowly the temperature
   changes, the more strain or shape recovery is accomplished at a specific
   temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Polyurethane foams are one of the most common auxetic structures
   regarding energy absorption enhancement. This present study evaluates
   the result reliability of two different numerical approaches, the
   H-method and the P-method, to obtain the best convergence solution. A
   polymeric re-entrant cell is created with a beam element and the results
   of the two different methods are compared. Additionally, the numerical
   results compare well with the analytical solution. The results show that
   there is a good agreement between converged FE models and the analytical
   solution. Regarding the computational cost, the P-method is more
   efficient for simulating the re-entrant structure subjected to axial
   loading. During the second part of this study, the re-entrant cell is
   used for generating a polymeric auxetic cellular tube. The mesh
   convergence study is performed on the cellular structures using the H-
   and P- methods. The cellular tube is subjected to tensional and
   compressive loading, the module of elasticity and Poisson's ration to
   calculate different aspect ratios. A nonlinear analysis is performed to
   compare the dynamic response of a cellular tube versus a solid tube. The
   crashworthiness indicators are addressed and the results are compared
   with equivalent solid tubes. The results show that the auxetic cellular
   tubes have better responses against compressive loading. The primary
   outcome of this research is to assess a reliable FE approach for
   re-entrant structures under axial loading.}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio (PR) of asphalt mixtures is a fundamental material
   property that is an important input parameter to viscoelastic pavement
   models. It is typically assumed that PR of asphalt is time independent
   or, in cases where the time dependency of viscoelastic PR is considered,
   calculated as the negative ratio of the time-dependent transverse and
   axial strains measured in a uniaxial creep test. This paper presents
   analytical and experimental results demonstrating the errors involved in
   these assumptions. The first part of this study derives an expression
   for viscoelastic PR. The second part of this study reports the results
   of various experimental tests to measure axial and transverse strains of
   asphalt concrete specimens under different loading conditions. The
   viscoelastic PR increased with time in the tensile relaxation test and
   ramped tensile test, whereas it slightly increased at the beginning of
   the compressive relaxation test and was subsequently virtually constant.
   The error introduced by incorrectly determining the PR as the negative
   ratio of transverse to axial strains in the time domain was found to be
   significant. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{One of the important mechanical properties of materials is Poisson's
   ratio, which is positive for most of the materials. However, certain
   materials exhibit ``auxetic{''} properties; that is, they have a
   negative Poisson's ratio. Thus auxetic and non-auxetic materials exhibit
   different deformation mechanisms. A specific microscopic structure in
   the auxetic materials is important for maintaining a negative Poisson's
   ratio. Based on their distinct nature auxetic materials execute certain
   unique properties in contrast to other materials, which are reviewed in
   this paper. Thus auxetic materials have important applications in the
   biomedical field which are also a part of this review article. Many
   auxetic materials have been discovered, fabricated, and synthesized
   which differ on the basis of structure, scale and deformation mechanism.
   The different types of auxetic materials such as auxetic cellular
   solids, microscopic auxetic polymers, molecular auxetic materials, and
   auxetic composites have been reviewed comprehensively in this paper.
   Modeling of auxetic structures is of considerable importance and needs
   appropriate stress strain configurations; thus different aspects of
   auxetic modeling have also been reviewed. Packing parameters and
   relative densities are of prime importance in this regard. This review
   would thus help the researchers in determining and deciding the various
   aspects of auxetic nature for their products.}},

   structures under compression}},
Journal = {{ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic cellular structures offer improvements in some mechanical
   properties due to their negative Poisson's ratio response when loaded.
   This study investigates and compares the effect of using multiple
   materials within three well researched cellular geometries, two auxetic:
   re-entrant and anti-tetrachiral, and one non-auxetic: hexagonal
   honeycomb. For each geometry, three different material configurations
   were used, a single material PLA structure and two dual-material
   structures: Polylactic Acid (PLA)-Nylon and PLA-Thermoplastic
   Polyurethane (TPU). A numerical model was developed to simulate these
   complex multi-material cellular geometries under a quasi-static
   compression load using Abaqus Explicit solver. To validate this
   numerical model, samples were additively manufactured and experimentally
   tested. They were found to show good correlation for the PLA and
   PLA-TPU. This study found that for situations where single loading
   cycles were required, for example, for crashworthy structures, the
   single material structures offered the highest performance where they
   absorbed the largest amount of energy. If multiple loading cycles are
   required, the multi-material structures offer the best solution due to
   the compression occurring through elastic buckling in comparison to
   plastic buckling in the single material. It was also found that through
   introducing materials with varying stiffnesses into specific regions
   within the structure, the Poisson's ratio through the compression could
   be modified for the re-entrant and honeycomb geometries.}},

Title = {{A novel auxetic structure based bone screw design: Tensile mechanical
   characterization and pullout fixation strength evaluation}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{188}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It was supposed that auxetic structure with negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) expands under stretch and could enhance the screw-bone fixation.
   In this study, the novel auxetic structure based bone screws were
   designed, and mechanical properties and fixation strength were
   evaluated. Auxetic unit cells (A1-A6) were introduced into the design of
   screw bodies after a mechanical evaluation. Tubular auxetic structures
   (TA1-TA6), auxetic screws (AS1-AS6) and one non-auxetic screw (NS) were
   manufactured using 3D-printing. The fabrication process well reproduced
   the original designs despite the some mismatch in the macro and micro
   morphologies. Tensile tests on specimens were conducted experimentally
   and computationally. The relationship between NPR and fixation strength
   of the screws was investigated by computationally bone-pullout test.
   Among all screw designs, AS2 generated the largest stiffness and
   strength, and better NPR, AS5 produced the highest NPR, and smallest
   stiffness and strength. Maximal pullout force within low-, mid- and
   high-density bone was shown in AS5 (399.39 N), AS6 (561.07 N) and AS2
   (1185.93 N) respectively. It was concluded that varying auxetic
   structures altered the screw's mechanical properties especially its
   functional properties. The bone-screw fixation could be improved by
   auxelic structures while other design factors should also be taken in
   account. (C) 2019 BeiHang University School of Biological Science and

Abstract = {{Centro-symmetric cellular honeycombs, in particular, their re-entrant
   version have been the subject of much research in recent years in view
   of their highly desirable macroscopic properties, including negative
   Poisson's ratio (auxetic) behavior. This work re-examines the mechanical
   properties of such honeycombs at the transition between the re-entrant
   and non re-entrant form, i.e. when the joints form a T-shaped junction,
   including the more general cases when the vertical ligaments have
   different thickness and material properties from the horizontal
   ligaments. It was shown through FE simulations that, contrary to current
   understanding, such honeycombs may deform in a manner which results in
   bending of the horizontal ligaments upon loading in the horizontal
   direction, with the result that such honeycombs may exhibit non-zero
   Poisson's ratio values. This effect was explained in terms of uneven
   stretching of the horizontal ribs upon uniaxial horizontal loading, a
   property which may also be employed to design honeycombs with negative
   Poisson's ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabric is known for its excellent mechanical
   properties, shear-resistance, cushioning property, energy absorbing
   abilities, therefore draws more and more attention to this kind of
   fabrics. In order to study the impact resistance and energy absorption
   ability of auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabrics under low-velocity
   impact, falling weight impact tests are adopted in this paper and
   influence relations of energy absorption and impact resistance to
   auxetic performance and initial impact energy are analyzed. Results show
   that the larger absolute value of negative Poisson's ratio is, the
   better energy absorption ability and impact resistance could be
   obtained, and the initial impact energy has little influence on the
   overall energy absorption of fabrics under low-velocity impact.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The small-strain stress-strain properties of expanded polystyrene (EPS)
   geofoam with densities of about 20 kg/m(3) and 30 kg/m(3) were evaluated
   by laboratory unconfined compression tests on specimens of 75 mm in
   diameter and 150 mm in height. Two series of tests were conducted, which
   were continuous monotonic loading (ML) tests and ML tests intervened by
   sustained creep loading and minute cycles of unload and reload.
   Relatively small vertical and horizontal strains were locally measured
   by means of a pair of local deformation transducers (LDTs) and a set of
   three clip gauges, respectively. The paramount importance of measuring
   local strains in compression tests on EPS to reliably evaluate its
   stress-strain properties, in particular those at relatively small
   strains, is demonstrated. The initial modulus, E-0, and Poisson's ratio,
   v(0), were evaluated from initial stress-strain relations at small
   strains obtained by these ML tests. The tangent parameters, E-tan and
   V-tan, were also evaluated from the ML stress-strain behaviour. The
   equivalent parameters, E-eq and v(eq), were evaluated from the
   stress-strain behaviour during minute cycles of unload and reload. The
   stress-strain behaviour is essentially linear only at small strains, and
   it becomes highly non-linear and a significant drop of stiffness occurs
   as observed in the overall stress-strain behaviour. The Poisson's ratio
   for inelastic deformation is found to be negative.}},

   fabricated via direct-laser cutting}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{167}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The design and production of multifunctional materials possessing
   tailored mechanical properties and specialized characteristics is a
   major theme in modern materials science, particularly for implementation
   in high-end applications in the biomedical and electronics industry. In
   this work, a number of metamaterials with perforated architectures
   possessing the ability to exhibit a plethora of 2D auxetic responses
   with negative Poisson's ratios ranging from quasi-zero to large negative
   values (lower than -3.5), stiffnesses, stretchability and surface
   coverage properties were manufactured. These systems were produced
   through the introduction of microstructural cuts in a rubber sheet using
   direct laser cutting, and analysed using a dual approach involving
   experimental tests and Finite Element Analysis. In addition to examining
   the mechanical properties of the perforated metamaterials, the influence
   of edge effects and material thickness on the deformation behaviour of
   these systems were investigated, with re-entrant systems shown to
   possess anomalous deformation profiles which are heavily dominated by
   the boundary regions. These findings highlight the effectiveness of this
   method for the fabrication of auxetic meta-material sheets as well as
   the large variety of mechanical properties, deformation mechanisms and
   load responses which may be obtained through what may be effectively
   described as simply the introduction of patterned cuts in a thin sheet.}},

   a review of state of art in the arena of auxetic materials, their usage
   as a antiballistic shield. A detailed discussion has been carried out
   pertaining to Auxetic Materials, their structure, manufacturing
   techniques employed by researchers, development of auxetic composite
   panels (AXP), their behaviour during ballistic analysis and post impact,
   failure modes in auxetic structures. The aim of this article is to
   explore this new branch of material and serve as an effective piece of

Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior of the uranyl carbonate mineral, rutherfordine,
   UO2CO3, was studied by means of theoretical solid-state methods based in
   Density Functional Theory using plane waves and pseudopotentials. The
   results of the computations reported in this work show that this mineral
   exhibits the important negative Poisson ratio (NPR) phenomenon. In order
   to show that this feature is not an artifact associated to the
   theoretical treatment employed, additional calculations were carried out
   using very large calculation parameters. These calculations improved the
   mechanical description of this mineral and confirmed its auxeticity,
   i.e., it shows NPR values. Rutherfordine is a highly anisotropic
   material showing a maximum value of the NPR of the order of -0.3 +/- 0.1
   for applied stresses directed along the X-axis, the transverse direction
   being the Y-axis perpendicular to the structural sheets in rutherfordine
   structure. The underlying reason for this observation is that under the
   effect of applied positive pressures, the interlayer space between the
   sheets of rutherfordine vary in the opposite way to the expected
   behavior; that is, it decreases instead of increasing.}},

Abstract = {{A method for quantifying the overall Poisson's ratio of a rod undergoing

   auxetic core exhibit same effective Poisson's ratio signs but with
   greater magnitude under torsional loading than under axial loading.
   However, a concentric compound rod with auxetic shell exhibits a range
   of volume fraction whereby the overall auxeticity of the rod is loading
   mode dependent, i.e., it behaves as a conventional rod under axial
   loading but as an auxetic rod under torsional loading. Hence a compound
   rod with conventional core and auxetic shell can be used as a smart
   structure that gives different response depending on the type of loading
   imposed on it.}},

   magnitude of the negative Poisson's ratio increases and finally
   approaches a limit at four layers, becoming very close to the bulk value

Abstract = {{Young's moduli of zeolite single crystals (natrolite, Na-2(Al2Si3O10)
   center dot 2H(2)O, NAT-type) have been determined directly using static
   three-point bend, compression and indentation experiments for the first
   time. The values compare well with those previously determined from
   dynamic studies (Brillouin scattering and ultrasound) of the same
   zeolite. A strong anisotropy in elasticity is detected, in particular a
   larger Young's modulus along the crystal z-axis compared to those along
   the x and y axes, which reflects the anisotropic, fibrous structure of
   natrolite. The idealised, siliceous natrolite structure has previously
   been predicted to possess on-axis negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic
   behaviour), but the measured elastic constants are not consistent with
   this hypothesis. We use new simulation results via a molecular mechanics
   approach to show that the presence of extra-framework cations and water
   molecules in the true aluminosilicate zeolite framework removes the
   on-axis auxetic behaviour expected for the hypothetical siliceous
   framework and then discuss our new calculated elastic constants in
   relation to the experimental values. (c) 2006 Acta Materialia Inc.

   hexagonal, auxetic and auxetic-chiral, have been compared. The three
   structures have the same critical cross-section and are made from an
   aluminium alloy A17075-T651. The reference region of each structure is
   represented by a matrix of nine elementary shaped cells (3 rows by 3
   columns). For each structure static and low-cycle fatigue experiments at
   different loading amplitudes were made. Numerical simulations were then
   performed for the same boundary conditions to predict the static and
   low-cycle fatigue durability. For this purpose a continuum damage
   mechanics approach with element removal was used in explicit dynamic
   simulations. The results of static simulations were also checked using
   the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM). All the numerical simulations
   were carried out using Abaqus. Good agreement was observed between the
   simulated and measured results for each of the three cellular
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures have unique properties wherein the structure
   collapses inward in the lateral direction when compressed longitudinally
   and expands in the lateral direction when subjected to longitudinal
   tensile load. This paper focuses on improving the impact absorption
   potential of the arrowhead auxetic structure. Topology optimization is
   performed on this structure to identify areas in the structure where
   material reduction is possible. The optimized structure inspired the
   creation of three new variants of the arrowhead structure. These designs
   are 3D printed using ABS and PLA materials. Compression and impact tests
   are performed on a drop test rig and a compression test set-up. From the
   results, an optimal design is obtained that strikes a balance between
   compressive strength and impact absorption. In addition, a scope for
   functional structures that are tailor-made for specific applications,
   based on a trade-off between impact absorptivity and compressive
   strength, is identified.}},

Abstract = {{In order to enhance the explosion-proof performance of the door and
   reduce the injury to passengers caused by the explosion impact load,
   this paper introduces the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure to
   the traditional door, and proposes a NPR explosion-proof door. It adopts
   the NPR functionally graded material to form the inner core part between
   the outer panel and inner panel, and sets different thicknesses to
   different gradient layers to meet the performance requirements of energy
   absorption and impact resistance. Because the relationships between the
   parameters and the performance indexes are unknown for this novel door,
   this work obtains the quantitative relationship between them by means of
   the response surface model (RSM). Based on this, the optimization
   mathematical models are established taking the inner panel acceleration,
   inner panel intrusion, energy absorption of NPR inner core structure and
   the mass of explosion-proof door as the optimization objectives. Then, a
   multi-objective optimization design is conducted for the novel
   explosion-proof door based on adaptive hybrid multi-objective particle
   swarm optimization (AHMOPSO) algorithm. Simulation results show that
   compared with the traditional door, the explosion-proof door optimized
   by AHMOPSO algorithm has better comprehensive explosion-proof
   performance. The results of this paper can provide some basis for the
   design and optimization of the explosion-proof door.}},

Title = {{Maximizing the effective stiffness of laminate composite materials}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{57-63}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The effective stiffness of laminate composites can be expressed
   explicitly and accurately as a function of several variables such as
   volume fractions and elastic constants of the constituent phases. Based
   on the stiffness function, an optimization procedure is proposed in this
   paper to maximize the effective Young's moduli of laminate composites in
   both longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to a number of
   design variables. By solving such a constrained optimization problem, a
   laminate composite can be designed by finding the optimal material
   properties of the constituent phases and their volume fractions. The
   effects of the volume fractions, the Young's moduli and the Poisson's
   ratios of the constituent phases in the effective composite stiffness
   are demonstrated through various design cases. It is shown that the
   optimized effective Young's moduli can reach values much higher than the
   well-known approximated Voigt estimation. Dramatic increases in the
   effective stiffness have also been found when the Poisson's ratios of
   the constituent phases approach the thermodynamic limits of -1 and 0.5.
   It is envisaged that with the proposed approach and modern fabrication
   technologies, laminate composites with exceptional effective stiffness
   can be easily designed and manufactured. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All

   thermal expansion properties of these systems under the assumption that
   the units exhibit increased rotational agitation once subjected to an
   increase in temperature. The effect of the geometric parameters on the

Abstract = {{A general expression for the directionally anisotropic Poisson's ratio
   (PR) of cubic materials under external pressure is discussed. It is
   expressed in terms of the elastic moduli ratios, X=G/K, Y=G/W, where K
   is the bulk modulus and G, W are shear moduli, and where the mechanical
   stability criteria are taken into account. The global maximum and global
   minimum PR surfaces are shown. In the X, Y-plane, regions of different
   auxetic behavior are identified, and a straightforward way of
   classifying any cubic material as auxetic, nonauxetic, and completely
   auxetic is given. The domains of the different extreme directions, for
   which the PR shows either a global maximum or a global minimum for given
   X-Y are identified and discussed. There are three extreme directions:
   {[}100], {[}110], and a novel, noncrystallographic one denoted as the
   V3-direction. The main features of the V3 extreme direction and
   corresponding XY-regions are described. It is found that the most
   extreme PR values can be achieved exclusively in the very limited domain
   of the X, Y-plane, corresponding to the V3-direction and for X, Y -> 0,
   the absolute value of the PR becomes unbounded. Analysis of literature
   data on real materials demonstrates that the great majority of cubic
   materials are nonauxetics or auxetics (with the {[}110] extreme
   direction). The materials possessing very large (i.e., PR > 2) and very
   small (i.e., PR < -1) PR values are identified. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{This chapter on wave propagation forms the second part of the
   elasto-dynamics of auxetic solids. Special emphasis is placed on the
   effect of negative Poisson's ratio towards the velocity of longitudinal
   waves in prismatic bars c(0), the velocity of plane waves of dilatation
   cl, the velocities of plane waves of distortion and torsional waves c(2)
   and Rayleigh waves c(3). A set of dimensionless wave velocities is
   introduced to facilitate the plotting of non-dimensional wave velocity
   in both the auxetic and conventional regions. As an alternative way of
   non-dimensionalization, all wave velocities can be normalized against
   the wave velocity for plane wave of dilatation. It is herein shown that
   some of the velocities of different types of waves are equal at
   non-positive Poisson's ratio, i.e. c(0) = c(1) at v = 0, c(0) = c2 at v
   = -0.5 and c(0) = c3 at v = 0.733. In the case of solitary waves in
   plates, Kolat et al. (J Non-Cryst Solids 356:2001-2009, 2010) showed
   that the amplitudes and velocities are approximately related to the
   magnitude of the Poisson's ratio, while the width of the initial pulse
   is related to the number of propagating solitary pulses.}},

Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a two-step optimization method is developed for designing
   microstructures with desired mechanical properties for 3D printing.
   Particularly, this method takes the numerical advantages of both
   material-based and boundary representation-based approaches to create
   microstructures with desired Poisson's ratios. The optimized
   microstructures possess explicit and smooth boundaries and thus they can
   be 3D printed without tedious post processing. In addition, the method
   can effectively prevent property deviations when interpreting the
   numerical solutions involving stepwise boundaries. Three 3D
   microstructures with different Poisson's ratios are numerically
   optimized and then fabricated using the Selective Laser Sintering
   technique. The practical Poisson's ratios of the samples are measured by
   conducting compression experiments. It will be seen that the tested
   Poisson's ratios match the numerical estimations in a high consistency,
   which demonstrates the advance of our design method for creating
   reliable microstructures for 3D printing and practical use. (C) 2018

Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{98}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic lattice cylindrical shell consisting of re-entrant lattice cell
   has superior mechanics performance due to negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR). In this work, finite element models were established and finite
   element method (FEM) was adopted to explore the deformation behaviors
   and energy absorption of re-entrant auxetic lattice cylindrical shells
   and the SILICOMB lattice cylindrical shell in different crushing
   velocity. Result indicated that the deformation behaviors of auxetic
   lattice cylindrical shells are expressed as NPR mode, and different
   deformation behaviors ('Z' mode, ring mode, diamond mode and mixed mode)
   of lattice sandwich cylindrical shells are mainly determined by the
   ratio of the core wall thickness to the skin. The SILICOMB lattice
   cylindrical shell has better performance than the conventional hexagon
   honeycomb lattice cylindrical shell when crushing under high velocity.
   Meanwhile, the SILICOMB sandwich cylindrical shell has the best
   performance on the specific energy absorption among these four
   configurations and the maximum increment is 20.77\%. The design of the
   auxetic and the SILICOMB cylindrical shells may provide a new idea which
   can be applied in practical application as impact resistance structures

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are modern class of materials that have recently been
   gaining popularity within the research community due to their enhanced
   mechanical properties. Unlike conventional materials, they exhibit a
   negative Poisson's ratio when subjected to a uniaxial loading. This
   present research experimentally investigates the crush response and
   energy absorption performances of auxetic foam-filled square tubes under
   axial loading. For comparison, the crush response and energy absorption
   of empty and conventional foam-filled squares tubes have also been
   examined with respect to deformation modes and force displacement curve.
   Standard compression tests were conducted on a series number of
   thin-walled tube samples. An additional compression test on conventional
   and auxetic foam has also been conducted to observe the behavior of foam
   itself. It is evident that the auxetic foam-filled square tubes are
   superior to empty and conventional foam-filled square tubes in terms of
   energy absorption capacity. It shows that such tube is preferable as an
   impact energy absorber due to their ability to withstand axial loads
   effectively. Furthermore, it is found that the load capacity increases
   as the crush length increases. The primary outcome of this study is
   design information for the use of auxetic foam-filled square tubes as
   energy absorbers where impact loading is expected particularly in
   crashworthiness applications. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Most conventional materials expand in transverse directions when they
   are compressed uniaxially resulting in the familiar positive Poisson's
   ratio. Here we develop a new class of two dimensional (2D) metamaterials
   with negative Poisson's ratio that contract in transverse directions
   under uniaxial compressive loads leading to auxeticity. This is achieved
   through mechanical instabilities (i.e., buckling) introduced by
   structural hierarchy and retained over a wide range of applied
   compression. This unusual behavior is demonstrated experimentally and
   analyzed computationally. The work provides new insights into the role
   of structural organization and hierarchy in designing 2D auxetic
   metamaterials, and new opportunities for developing energy absorbing
   materials, tunable membrane filters, and acoustic dampeners.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic two-dimensional (2D) materials provide a promising platform for
   biomedicine, sensors, and many other applications at the nanoscale. In
   this work, utilizing a hypothesis-based data-driven approache, we
   identify multiple materials with remarkable in-plane auxetic behavior in
   a family of buckled monolayer 2D materials. These materials are
   transition metal selenides and transition metal halides with the
   stoichiometry MX (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Ag, and X = Se, Cl, Br,
   I). First-principles calculations reveal that the desirable auxetic
   behavior of these 2D compounds originates from the interplay between the
   buckled 2D structure and the weak metal-metal interaction determined by
   their electronic structures. We observe that the Poisson's ratio is
   sensitive to magnetic order and the amount of uniaxial stress applied. A
   transition from positive Poisson's ratio (PPR) to negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) for a subgroup of MX compounds under large uniaxial stress
   is predicted. The work provides a guideline for the future design of 2D
   auxetic materials at the nanoscale.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, 3D metamaterials have been achieved with inaccessible
   mechanical properties in natural materials such as negative Poisson's
   ratio, stiffness, and thermal expansion coefficient. While most of the
   developed metamaterials are with engineerable deformation evolution of
   structures, few studies have revealed their potential in energy
   absorption due to the limited mechanical properties of 3D-printed
   constituent materials and inevitable structural defects induced by the
   manufacturing process. Herein, an approach is proposed for creating 3D
   metamaterials of auxetic composite lattices via laser-sintering of
   carbon nanotubes reinforced nanocomposites, which provide a platform for
   the design and manufacturing of systems with programmable energy
   absorption capability. The optimization of constituent material and
   structural design enables the improvement of energy absorption
   performance across multiple scales. The energy absorption capacity of
   auxetic metamaterials was exponentially scaled with the relative density
   with the order of 2.5-3. The rationally topologized auxetic
   metamaterials exhibit a combination of high specific densification
   strength (0.0195 MPa kg(-1) m(-3)), ultrahigh energy absorption capacity
   (6.29 MJ m(-3)), and excellent specific energy absorption (20.42 J
   g(-1)). Impressively, this group of auxetic metamaterials possesses the
   advantageous specific energy absorption approaching that of titanium
   alloy foams as well as over a broad range of materials including plastic
   foams, aluminum alloy foams, and other 3D-printed lightweight
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials behave unconventionally under deformation, which
   enhances material properties such as resistance to indentation and
   energy absorption. Auxetics, therefore, have the potential to enhance
   sporting protective equipment. Herein, finite element modeling, additive
   manufacturing and impact testing of three auxetic lattices, and a
   conventional equivalent, with a view to advance auxetic implementation
   within sports equipment, are explored. The lattices are modeled and
   impacts are simulated between 1 and 5 J, for flat and hemispherical drop
   hammers. Simulation outputs including peak impact force, impact
   duration, maximum axial strain, and Poisson's ratio are compared with
   experimental results from equivalent impact energies on additively
   manufactured lattices, using an instrumented drop tower and a high-speed
   camera. The simulation and experimental results show broad agreement for
   all lattices and scenarios, demonstrated by comparative force versus
   time plots and maximum compression images. The benefits of developing
   and validating finite element models of three auxetic lattices (and the
   conventional honeycomb lattice) under various impact scenarios, as a
   process, are discussed, including material characterization of an
   exemplar thermoplastic polyurethane. Future work can use the models to
   further investigate auxetic lattices, selecting and tailoring candidates
   to further explore their potential application to specific personal

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{A new auxetic microstructure is introduced herein by inspiration from an
   Islamic geometric pattern that consists of square array of 8-pointed
   rigid stars interspersed with square array of 4-pointed rigid stars. By
   permitting each star to slide across its adjoining neighbors through
   incorporation of slots and sliders in the stars, an in-plane isotropic
   Poisson's ratio of -1, and hence equi-biaxial strain, is achieved upon
   applied uniaxial compression. Apart from the negativity of Poisson's
   ratio, another counter-intuitive property is the occurrence of global
   rotation of the entire structure relative to the stars during
   compression. Results indicate that when fully compressed, the in-plane
   strain is -0.232 with the accompanying global rotation of 6.18 degrees.
   Without the 4-pointed stars, the system can achieve an in-plane strain
   of -0.288 with a corresponding global rotation of 7.86 degrees.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic crushing behavior of the opencell aluminum foam with

   NPR open-cell foam under impact loading are less than the conventional
   foam with the same relative density, and the deformation pattern of NPR
   open-cell foam material is completely different from the conventional
   foam material. The NPR open-cell foam material is not suitable for
   energy absorption under lowvelocity impact, but the negative Poisson's
   ratio effect on deformation modes becomes smaller with the impact
   velocity increasing. The length-to-height ratio which is defined for a
   cell having certain geometric characteristics is a key parameter to

Abstract = {{The auxetic foams first produced by Lakes have been modelled in a
   variety of ways, each model trying to reproduce some observed feature of
   the microscale of the foams. Such features include bent or broken ribs
   or inverted angles between ribs. These models can reproduce the
   Poisson's ratio or Poisson's function of auxetic foam if the model
   parameters are carefully chosen. However these model parameters may not
   actually reflect the internal structure of the foams. A big problem is
   that measurement of parameters such as lengths and angles is not
   straightforward within a 3-d sample. In this work a sample of auxetic
   foam has been imaged by 3-d X-ray computed tomography. The resulting
   image is translated to a form that emphasises the geometrical structure
   of connected ribs. This connected rib data are suitably analysed to
   describe both the microstructural construction of auxetic foams and the
   statistical spread of structure, that is, the heterogeneity of an
   auxetic foam. From the analysis of the microstructure, observations are
   made about the requirements for microstructural models and comparisons
   made to previous existing models. From the statistical data, measures of
   heterogeneity are made that will help with future modelling that
   includes the heterogeneous aspect of auxetic foams. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{This chapter considers the damage properties of auxetic solids. In the
   study of stress concentration factors in auxetic solids and plates
   arising from cavities and rigid inclusions, most cases exhibit minimum
   stress concentration when the solids possess negative Poisson's ratio.
   In discussing the three modes of fracture in auxetic solids in
   dimensionless terms, most plots exhibit a clear demarcation between
   auxetic and conventional regions. The consideration of damage criteria
   based on thermodynamic analysis by Lemaitre and Baptiste (NSF workshop
   on mechanics of damage and fracture, 1982) shows that as an isotropic
   solid changes from conventional to auxetic, the damage criterion shifts
   from being highly dependent on the von Mises equivalent stress to being
   highly dependent on the hydrostatic stress. Progress on fatigue failure
   of auxetic materials is then given.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an analytical approach is proposed to investigate the
   nonlinear dynamic analysis of porous eccentrically stiffened (PES)
   double curved shallow auxetic shells with negative Poisson?s ratio (NPR)
   subjected to blast, mechanical and thermal loads resting on
   Visco-Pasternak foundation model. The three-layer double curved shallow
   shell consists of auxetic honeycombs core layer with NPR integrated,
   isotropic homogeneous materials at the top and bottom of surfaces.
   Besides, the outer surfaces of the system reinforced by PES are made of
   functionally graded materials (FGM) and auxetic shells are placed in
   thermal environments. Combining with the first-order shear deformation
   theory and Von-Karman strains, governing equations for nonlinear dynamic
   response of PES double curved shallow auxetic shells in thermal
   environments are derived. Then, the stress function and Galerkin methods
   are proposed to obtain the result equations: fundamental frequency,
   dynamic response, and frequency?amplitude relation. Compared with the
   published literature, the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed
   analysis approach are validated. Finally, the effects of stiffeners,
   Poisson?s ratio, cell inclined angle, mechanical, thermal and blast
   loads, elastic foundations, boundary conditions, geometrical parameters
   of auxetic honeycombs core and shell on the nonlinear dynamic response
   of PES double curved shallow auxetic shells in thermal environments are

Abstract = {{In this article, we present an experimental study validating the concept
   of the reinforced-core auxetic assemblies. The main distinctive feature
   of these assemblies is the presence of a reinforcing core in the
   microstructural units that increases the shear stiffness and thus
   produces negative Poisson's ratio. We tested a number of prototypes
   manufactured using the stereolithography and selective laser sintering
   methods. To measure the deformations, we employed the close-range
   photogrammetry method, which enables monitoring of locations of
   unlimited number of points from digital images. We developed a procedure
   for multi-point measurement of planar deformations using a single
   digital camera. This procedure allows for continuous measurement of
   deformations without interruption to the loading sequence. Camera
   self-calibration is based on multiple images of stable reference points,
   which enables high accuracy of the measurements even using a consumer
   grade digital camera. We compare the obtained experimental results with
   a simplified continuum model. We demonstrate a good agreement between
   the theoretical predictions and the experimental results. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The paper discusses the problem of recovery of the microstructure of the
   least compliant bodies of non-homogeneous optimal isotropic properties
   predicted by the Isotropic Material Design method. The three-dimensional
   microstructure is assumed as constructed by a subsequent lamination
   process in which two isotropic materials of ordered properties are used,
   the process being repeated three or six times, subsequently. The Hooke
   tensors closest to the optimal ones are found by making use of the
   analytical Francfort-Murat formulae for effective moduli of third and
   sixth rank sequential laminates. The ability to model an auxetic
   behavior within the subdomains where the optimal Poisson's ratio assumes
   negative values is also shown.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional model of tri-atomic molecules (in which `atoms' are
   distributed on vertices of equilateral triangles, and which are further
   referred to as cyclic trimers) is solved exactly in the static
   (zero-temperature) limit for the nearest-neighbour site-site
   interactions. It is shown that the cyclic trimers form a mechanically
   stable and elastically isotropic non-chiral phase of negative Poisson
   ratio. The properties of the system are illustrated by three examples of
   atom-atom interaction potentials: (i) the purely repulsive
   (n-inverse-power) potential, (ii) the purely attractive (n-power)
   potential and (iii) the Lennard-Jones potential which shows both the
   repulsive and the attractive part. The analytic form of the dependence
   of the Poisson ratio on the interatomic potential is obtained. It is
   shown that the Poisson ratio depends, in a universal way, only on the
   trimer anisotropy parameter both (1) in the limit of n --> infinity for
   cases (i) and (ii), as well as (2) at the zero external pressure for any
   potential with a doubly differentiable minimum, case (iii) is an

Abstract = {{This chapter establishes the effect of auxeticity on shear deformation
   in laterally-loaded thick beams, laterally-loaded thick circular,
   polygonal and rectangular plates, buckling of thick columns and plates,
   and vibration of thick plates. Results show that shear deformation
   reduces as the Poisson's ratio becomes more negative, thereby implying
   that geometrically thick beams and plates are mechanically thin beams
   and plates, respectively, if the Poisson's ratio is sufficiently
   negative. In other words, results of deflections in Timoshenko beam and
   Mindlin plate approximate those by Euler-Bernoulli beam and Kirchhoff
   plate, respectively, as the Poisson's ratio approaches -1. In the study
   of buckling of isotropic columns, it was found that auxeticity increases
   the buckling load such that the buckling loads of Timoshenko columns
   approximate those of Euler-Bernoulli columns as v -> -1 In the case of
   vibration of thick isotropic plates, it was shown that as a plate's
   Poisson's ratio becomes more negative, the Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff natural
   frequency ratio increases with diminishing rate. Furthermore,
   simplifying assumptions such as constant shear correction factor and
   exclusion of rotary inertia is valid for plates with positive Poisson's
   ratio, and that the assumptions of constant shear correction factor and
   no rotary inertia for auxetic plates give overestimated natural
   frequency.}},

   Properties toward Treating Myocardial Infarction}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{An auxetic conductive cardiac patch (AuxCP) for the treatment of
   myocardial infarction (MI) is introduced. The auxetic design gives the
   patch a negative Poisson's ratio, providing it with the ability to
   conform to the demanding mechanics of the heart. The conductivity allows
   the patch to interface with electroresponsive tissues such as the heart.
   Excimer laser microablation is used to micropattern a re-entrant
   honeycomb (bow-tie) design into a chitosan-polyaniline composite. It is
   shown that the bow-tie design can produce patches with a wide range in
   mechanical strength and anisotropy, which can be tuned to match native
   heart tissue. Further, the auxetic patches are conductive and
   cytocompatible with murine neonatal cardiomyocytes in vitro. Ex vivo
   studies demonstrate that the auxetic patches have no detrimental effect
   on the electrophysiology of both healthy and MI rat hearts and conform
   better to native heart movements than unpatterned patches of the same
   material. Finally, the AuxCP applied in a rat MI model results in no
   detrimental effect on cardiac function and negligible fibrotic response
   after two weeks in vivo. This approach represents a versatile and robust
   platform for cardiac biomaterial design and could therefore lead to a
   promising treatment for MI.}},

Title = {{Preparation of auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabric impregnated with shear
   thickening fluid for low-velocity impact resistance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL TEXTILES}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports the preparation of auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabric
   impregnated with shear thickening fluid and studied its impact behavior
   under low-velocity impact loading. The shear thickening fluids have been
   prepared by mechanically dispersing 12 nm silica particles with weight
   fraction of 10, 15, 20, and 25\% in various carriers (PEG200, PEG400,
   and PEG600). Rheological results indicate that shear thickening fluid
   experiences shear thickening transition at a specific shear rate. The
   critical shear rate reduces, and initial viscosity and maximum viscosity
   increase with the increase of silica weight fraction. The higher
   molecular weight of polyethylene glycols can lead to lower critical
   shear rate. The impact process of composite under impact loading can be
   divided into three stages. The warp-knitted spacer fabric with different
   negative Poisson's ratio has a significant effect on the impact
   behavior. The warp-knitted spacer fabric with better auxetic performance
   endows composite better impact resistance, the specific performance is
   the deformation depth, and energy absorption and peak load increase with
   the increase of auxetic effect of fabric. The silica weight fraction of
   shear thickening fluid can increase the energy absorption of composite
   due to the shear thickening transition of shear thickening fluid. Shear
   thickening fluid has a synergistic effect with the auxetic warp-knitted

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have a negative Poisson's ratio, that is, they expand
   laterally when stretched longitudinally. One way of obtaining a negative
   Poisson's ratio is by using a re-entrant cell structure. Auxetic foam
   was fabricated from a conventional polymeric foam. Assuming similar
   mechanical properties for the solid material comprising the foams, the
   principle variable affecting the properties of the foam is the geometry
   of the cells. This means that the unusual mechanical properties of
   auxetic foams are attributed to the deformation characteristics of
   re-entrant microstructures. In this paper, the results of optical- and
   scanning electron-microscopic studies of the geometrical parameters for
   the different foams examined are presented. Examples of the
   microstructural deformation mechanisms observed are also presented.
   Comparison between the conventional foams and their auxetic conversions
   are also made.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Elastic metamaterials have promising applications in wave control and
   vibration isolation, due to their extraordinary characteristics, e.g.,
   negative Poisson ratio, band gaps, effective negative mass density and
   effective negative modulus. How to develop new functional metamaterials
   using a special structure has always been a hot topic in this field. In
   this study, a three-dimensional (3D) star structure is designed to
   construct metamaterials with both negative static and dynamic
   properties. The results show that the 3D star structure formed a wide
   band gap at lower frequency and had a negative Poisson's ratio.
   Different from conventional acoustic metamaterials, the main physical
   mechanism behind the low-frequency band gap of the 3D star structure is
   the resonance mode formed by the bending deformation of each rib plate,
   which made it easier to achieve effective isolation of low-frequency
   elastic waves with a low mass density. In addition, many structural
   parameters of the 3D star structure can be modulated to effectively
   adjust the band gap frequency by changing the angle between the concave
   nodes and aspect ratio. This study provides a new way to design the 3D
   acoustic metamaterials and develop the lightweight vibration isolation
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{By possessing a good capacity for energy absorption and a lightweight
   structure, the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure has very fine
   prospects for application in vehicle engineering. By combining the
   traditional side door impact beam and a NPR structure, a novel side door
   NPR impact beam is first proposed in this work to improve the side
   impact crashworthiness in automobiles. The performance of the side door
   NPR impact beam is first studied in detail by comparison with a
   traditional side door impact beam and aluminum-foam-filled impact beam.
   To make further improvement on the performance of the side door NPR
   impact beam, the multi-objective design optimization while considering
   reliability is also investigated in this work. The parametric model of
   the NPR structure is established to improve modeling efficiency when the
   shape and topology are changed. A Latin hypercube sampling technique,
   orthogonal design, and a response surface model are then combined to
   construct the surrogate models. A radial-based importance sampling
   technique (RBIS) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization
   algorithm (MOPSO) are applied in the inner and outer loop respectively
   to find the optimal multi-objective reliability solutions. The results
   indicate that the side impact crashworthiness is improved remarkably by
   the side door NPR impact beam and the structure is further improved by
   the multi-objective reliability optimization. The studies in this work
   also serve as a good example for other improvements in automobile
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{By means of extensive ab initio calculations, a new two-dimensional (2D)
   atomic material tin selenide monolayer (coined as tinselenidene) is
   predicted to be a semiconductor with an indirect gap (similar to 1.45
   eV) and a high hole mobility (of order 10000 cm(2)V(-1)S(-1)), and will
   bear an indirect-direct gap transition under a rather low strain (<0.5
   GPa). Tinselenidene has a very small Young's modulus (20-40 GPa) and an
   ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (<3 Wm(-1)K(-1) at 300 K), making
   it probably the most flexible and most heat-insulating material in known
   2D atomic materials. In addition, tinseleniden has a large negative
   Poisson's ratio of -0.17, thus could act as a 2D auxetic material. With

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new bi-material microstructural design method for
   chiral auxetic metamaterials. Based on the independent point-wise
   density interpolation (iPDI) and a bi-material model, optimal design
   problem of periodic unit cells is formulated using nodal density
   variables. The design objective is to minimize the Poisson's ratio while
   satisfying the specified volume constraints of the hard and soft
   materials, and the effective elastic properties of the bi-material
   microstructure are computed by the asymptotic homogenization method
   under periodic boundary conditions. This topology optimization problem
   is solved with a gradient-based mathematical programming algorithm on
   the basis of the sensitivity analysis. Several numerical examples,
   regarding design of anisotropic, orthogonal anisotropic and isotropic
   bi-material microstructures of chiral auxetic metamaterials, are given
   to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. It is shown that the
   proposed bi-material design optimization method can be used to improve
   the performance of chiral auxetic metamaterials through enlarging the

   exhibiting (Gaussian) size distribution of atomic diameters - i.e. size
   polydispersity - is studied at the molecular number density 1/root 2;
   the distance between centers of atoms forming dimers is considered as a
   length unit. It is shown that, at the fixed number density of the
   dimers, increasing polydispersity causes, typically, an increase in
   pressure, elastic constants and Poisson's ratio; the latter is positive
   in most directions. A direction is found, however, in which the size
   polydispersity causes a substantial decrease in Poisson's ratio, down to
   negative values for large n. Thus, the system is partially auxetic for

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratios have been observed in a variety of metals and
   alloys. However, the electronic origin of this effect remains unclear,
   as is evident by our limited knowledge about intermetallics showing this
   behavior. In an effort to clarify the electronic origin of a negative
   Poisson's ratio, we have performed a systematic and comprehensive study
   of extreme (both positive and negative) Poisson's ratios behavior in the
   B2 CsCl-type AB intermetallic family (including 14 common intermetallics
   and 128 rare-earth-metal transition or main-group-metal intermetallics)
   by way of density functional theory calculations. We found a pronounced
   correlation between the extreme Poisson's ratios and the elastic
   anisotropy, with approximately 70\% of the B2 intermetallics showing
   intrinsic auxetic behavior. We went on to examine the topology and
   geometry of the electron charge density and found that the extreme
   Poisson's ratios are attributable to the directionality of the bonds of
   the material. Auxetic materials were found to have nondirectional bonds,
   and nonauxetic compounds had directional bonds. Our findings provide an
   essential electronic perspective to forecast the auxetic behavior, and
   suggest a new application for intermetallic compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Developing functional small-diameter vascular grafts is an important
   objective in tissue engineering research. In this study, we address the
   problem of compliance mismatch by designing and developing a 3D tubular
   construct that has a negative Poisson's ratio v(xy) (NPR). NPR
   constructs have the unique ability to expand transversely when pulled
   axially, thereby resulting in a highly-compliant tubular construct. In
   this work, we used projection stereolithography to 3D-print a planar NPR
   sheet composed of photosensitive poly(ethylene) glycol diacrylate
   biomaterial. We used a step-lithography exposure and a stitch process to
   scale up the projection printing process, and used the cut-missing rib
   unit design to develop a centimeter-scale NPR sheet, which was rolled up
   to form a tubular construct. The constructs had Poisson's ratios of -0.6
   <= -v(xy) <= -0.1. The NPR construct also supports higher cellular
   adhesion than does the construct that has positive v(xy). Our NPR design
   offers a significant advance in the development of highly-compliant
   vascular grafts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops an auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) piezoelectric
   energy harvester (APEH) to increase the power output when harnessing
   strain energy. The APEH consists of a piezoelectric element bonded to an
   auxetic substrate. The auxetic substrate concentrates the applied stress
   and strain into the region of the piezoelectric element and introduces
   auxetic behaviour in the piezoelectric element, both of which increase
   the electric power output. A finite element model was developed to
   optimise the design and verify the mechanism of the power increase.
   Three APEHs were manufactured and characterised. Their performance was
   compared with two equivalent strain energy harvesters with plain
   substrates. Experimental results show that the APEHs, excited by
   sinusoidal strains of 250 is peak-to-peak at 10 Hz, are able to produce
   electric power of up to 191.1 mu W, which is 14.4 times that of the peak
   power produced by the plain harvesters (13.4 mu W). The power gain
   factor is constant between samples as the amplitude and frequency of
   their applied strains are varied. The model and experimental results are
   in good agreement, once accounting for the imperfect bonding of the
   epoxy using the spring constant of the Thin Elastic Layers on the
   modelled epoxy surfaces. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recently synthesized atomically thin boron sheets (that is, borophene)
   provide a fascinating template for new material property discovery.
   Here, we report findings of an extraordinary combination of unusual
   mechanical and electronic properties in hydrogenated borophene, known as
   borophane, from first-principles calculations. This novel 2D material
   has been shown to exhibit robust Dirac transport physics. Our study
   unveils that borophane is auxetic with a surprising negative Poisson's
   ratio stemming from its unique puckered triangle hinge structure and the
   associated hinge dihedral angle variation under a tensile strain in the
   armchair direction. Our results also identify borophane to be
   ferroelastic with a stress-driven 90 lattice rotation in the boron
   layer, accompanied by a remarkable orientation switch of the anisotropic
   Dirac transport channels. These outstanding strain-engineered properties
   make borophane a highly versatile and promising 2D material for
   innovative applications in microelectromechanical and nanoelectronic
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is dedicated to Prof. Jacques Friedel, an inspirational
   scientist and a great man. His excellence and clear vision led to
   significant advances in theoretical physics, which spilled into material
   science and technological applications. His fundamental theoretical work
   on commonplace materials has become classic. We can think of no better
   tribute to Friedel than to apply a fundamental analysis in his spirit to
   a peculiar class of materials-auxetic materials. Auxetic materials, or
   negative-Poisson'-ratio materials, are important technologically and
   fascinating theoretically. When loaded by external stresses, their
   internal strains are governed by correlated motion of internal
   structural degrees of freedom. The modelling of such materials is mainly
   based on ordered structures, despite the existence of auxetic behaviour
   in disordered structures and the advantage in manufacturing disordered
   structures for most applications. We describe here a first-principles
   expression for strains in disordered such materials, based on insight
   from a family of `iso-auxetic' structures. These are structures,
   consisting of internal structural elements, which we name `auxetons',
   whose inter-element forces can be computed from statics alone.
   Iso-auxetic structures make it possible not only to identify the
   mechanisms that give rise to auxeticity, but also to write down the
   explicit dependence of the strain rate on the local structure, which is
   valid to all auxetic materials. It is argued that stresses give rise to
   strains via two mechanisms: auxeton rotations and auxeton
   expansion/contraction. The former depends on the stress via a local
   fabric tensor, which we define explicitly for 2D systems. The latter
   depends on the stress via an expansion tensor. Whether a material
   exhibits auxetic behaviour or not depends on the interplay between these
   two fields. This description has two major advantages: it applies to any
   auxeton-based system, however disordered, and it goes beyond
   conventional elasticity theory, providing an explicit expression for
   general auxetic strains and outlining the relevant equations.}},

Abstract = {{Occurrence of toppling failure has been prominent due to the increasing
   of infrastructure construction, such as road slopes, dams, and
   hydroelectric stations. Many scholars have done research on the toppling
   failure characteristics, but paid less attention to the comparison of
   numerical simulations and physical models in order to propose reasonable
   and effective stability control methods. Based on previous tests on
   physical model and field investigations, a numerical model of an
   anaclinal slope using the three-dimension distinct element code (3DEC)
   software has been built to simulate the failure process of the physical
   model. Based on the prominent mechanical properties of the
   engineering-scale and model-scale negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) cables,
   a numerical simulation model of the NPR cable has been developed. The
   numerical model has been used to simulate the effects of different types
   of model-scale cables on controlling the deformation of the anaclinal
   slope. The numerical results show that standard cables, i.e., Poisson's
   ratio (PR) cables, cannot control the large deformations of the slope,
   and the slope finally fails. On the opposite, NPR cables can absorb the
   deformation energy and maintain the stable constant resistance force
   during the tensile process. This thereby allows avoiding tensile
   breakage of cables under the effect of large deformations of the slope
   and driving the slope towards a new equilibrium state. Through the
   comparison between the numerical simulation results and the physical
   model test results, the accuracy and rationality of the numerical
   simulations have been proven. The numerical model developed in this
   study can be used for future research works on the failure mechanism of
   anaclinal slopes and the control effect of NPR cables. It thereby lays a
   foundation for applying the NPR cables to control the toppling
   deformations of similar anaclinal slopes.}},

Abstract = {{Bistable Auxetic Metamaterials (BAMs) are a class of monolithic
   perforated periodic structures with negative Poisson's ratio. Under
   tension, a BAM can expand and reach a second state of equilibrium
   through a globally large shape transformation that is ensured by the
   flexibility of its elastomeric base material. However, if made from a
   rigid polymer, or metal, BAM ceases to function due to the inevitable
   rupture of its ligaments. The goal of this work is to extend the unique
   functionality of the original kirigami architecture of BAM to a rigid
   solid base material. We use experiments and numerical simulations to
   assess performance, bistability, and durability of rigid BAMs at 10,000
   cycles. Geometric maps are presented to elucidate the role of the main
   descriptors of the BAM architecture. The proposed design enables the
   realization of BAM from a large palette of materials, including
   elastic-perfectly plastic materials and potentially brittle materials.}},

Abstract = {{A model is designed for predicting the elastic constants of a random
   planar network of interconnected fibres while accounting for two
   features of such networks: negative Poisson ratio behaviour and random
   triangulation. The model is based on a periodic network involving both
   plates and fibres segments, with possibility of reentrant cell shapes.
   The plates are intended to represent the effect of triangulation. Bounds
   for the elastic constants are obtained by calculating volume weighted
   averages of the elastic properties for periodic networks characterised
   by a uniform distribution of in-plane fibre orientations. Predictions
   are derived for the dependence of the in-plane Young's modulus,
   out-of-plane Young's modulus, and in-plane shear modulus on out-of-plane
   fibre orientation for a fibre volume fraction of 0.20. These predictions
   are assessed by reference to experimental results for transversely
   isotropic networks, with very low average out-of-plane fibre
   orientation, made by sintering compressed mats of stainless steel
   fibres. A comparison is also made with the predictions of a model for
   truss lattice core, which is liable to represent the case of a fully
   triangulated network. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Using a combination of analytic and computational methods, we examine
   the effect of adding hierarchical substructure to an auxetic lattice.
   Our novel methodology, involving a coarse grain approach, allows for the
   analysis of hierarchically sub-structured lattices where direct
   computation would prove intractable. We show that through hierarchy one
   can create ultra-lightweight auxetic meta-materials of high strength and
   stiffness. Through scaling law arguments, we show that the benefits of
   hierarchical design can also be obtained in the general class of
   bending-dominated lattices. Furthermore, we show that the hierarchical
   structures presented show a wide range of tailorability in their
   mechanical properties, and exhibit increased strength when optimised for
   buckling resistance. Auxetic materials have a broad range of potential
   applications, and thus the creation of ultra-light auxetic
   meta-materials with enhanced stiffness and strength is undoubtedly of
   practical importance.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials with artificially designed architectures can achieve
   unique and even unprecedented physical properties, which show promising
   applications in actuators, amplifiers and micromechanical controls. An
   initiator-integrated 3D printing technology (i3DP) was applied in this
   study to create scalable, metal/polymer meta-mechanical materials, which
   can gradually achieve negative Poisson's ratio, high strength and
   ultralow density, as well as high compressive and super-elastic
   behavior. The i3DP was enabled by integrating an atomic-transfer radical
   polymerization (ATRP) initiator with UV-curable resin, followed by
   polyelectrolyte brushes (PMETAC) grafting via surface-initiated ATRP and
   thereafter electroless plating to form metal coatings. Compared with
   polymer structures, the compressive stress of metal-polymer structure
   can be doubled when deposited with a 190 nm copper layer. The hollow
   metallic materials possess a tunable Poisson's ratio, and the highest
   average recoverability, which can recover nearly completely to their
   original shape after over 30\% compression. Overall, this i3DP approach
   provides meta-structures with substantial benefits from the hierarchical
   design and fabrication flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials with re-entrant type lattice structure with cubic symmetry
   are studied. The main new result is that the continuum theory of porous
   media generalized to the case of media with cubic symmetry can
   adequately describe the effective properties of a wide class of lattice
   structures as continuum media. Identification of the micro-dilatational
   elastic constants for the cellular metamaterials with negative Poisson's
   ratio is carried out. Methods for identifying the parameters of the
   micro-dilatation theory of media through the structural and rigidity
   parameters of lattice structures are developed. It is shown that
   material constants of the micro-dilatation theory can be directly linked
   with the geometrical and elastic parameters of the unit cell of the
   metamaterial. In particular, ``void stiffness{''} modulus and voids
   diffusion parameter depend linearly on the stiffness of re-entrant
   structures in the unit cells and coupling modulus depends significantly
   only on the geometry of the unit cell. This result is obtained using
   micro dilatational analytical solution of the homogeneous elasticity
   problem and FE modeling of the uniaxial tension, hydrostatic compression
   and simple shear of the beam lattice metamaterial models. The problem of
   non-homogeneous uniaxial deformation of the rod and the problem of the
   pure bending of the beam were used to determine the voids diffusion
   parameter. It is shown, in particular, that the coupled and scale
   effects are equivalent for the studied continuum and lattice models of
   the metamaterials in the considered range of parameters. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Auxetic and other mechanical metamaterials are typically studied in
   situations where they are subjected solely to mechanical forces or
   displacements even though they may be designed to exhibit additional

   externally applied magnetic fields can tune the geometry and macroscopic
   properties of known auxetics that incorporate magnetic component/s, thus
   resulting in a change of their macroscopic properties. Anomalous
   properties which are observed in such novel magneto-mechanical systems
   include tunable Poisson's ratios, bi-stability or multi-stability,
   depending on the applied magnetic fields, and other
   electromagnetic-mechanical effects such as strain dependent induced
   electric currents and magnetic fields. The properties exhibited depend,
   amongst other things, on the relative position and orientation of the

Abstract = {{The Boltzmann-Volterra linear constitutive equation for isotropic
   non-aging viscoelastic materials is studied analytically in order to
   elucidate its abilities to provide a qualitative simulation of
   rheological effects related to different behavior types of lateral
   strain and the Poisson's ratio (i.e. lateral contraction ratio) observed
   in uni-axial tests under tension or compression at constant stress rate.
   The viscoelasticity equation is controlled by two material functions of
   a positive real argument (that is shear and bulk creep compliances);
   they are implied to be positive, differentiable, increasing and convex
   up functions. General properties of the volumetric, longitudinal and
   lateral strain-time curves, stress-strain curves and the Poisson's ratio
   evolution in time generated by the viscoelasticity relation (with an
   arbitrary shear and bulk creep functions) are examined, their dependence
   on stress rate and on qualitative characteristics of two creep functions
   are analyzed, conditions for their monotonicity and convexity or for
   existence of extrema, inflection points and sign changes are studied.
   Taking into account compressibility and volumetric creep (governed by a
   time-dependent bulk creep function) is proved to affect strongly the
   qualitative behavior of lateral strain and the Poisson's ratio. In
   particular, it is proved that the linear theory can reproduce
   increasing, decreasing or non-monotone and convex up or down
   dependencies of lateral strain and Poisson's ratio on time under tension
   or compression at constant stress rate, it can provide existence of
   minimum, maximum or inflection points and sign changes from minus to
   plus and vice versa. It is shown, that the Poisson's ratio at any moment
   of time is confined in the interval from -1 to 0.5 and the restriction
   on creep compliancies providing negative values of the Poisson's ratio
   is derived. Criteria for the Poisson's ratio increase or decrease and
   for extrema existence are obtained. The analysis revealed the set of
   characteristic features of the theoretic volumetric, axial and lateral
   strain-time curves, stress-strain curves families and the Poisson's
   ratio dependence on time which are convenient to check in tensile tests
   at constant stress rates and should be employed as indicators of the
   linear viscoelasticity theory applicability (or non-applicability) for
   simulation of a material behavior before identification.
   The specific properties of the two models are considered based on the
   assumption that the Poisson's ratio is time-independent or the
   assumption that bulk creep function is constant which neglects bulk
   creep and simulates purely elastic volumetric strain dependence on a
   mean stress. This assumptions reduce the number of material function to
   the single one and one scalar parameter and are commonly (and very
   often) used for simplification of viscoelasticity problems solutions. A
   number of restrictions and additional applicability indicators are found
   for this models. In particular, it is proved that elastic volumetric
   deformation assumption does not cut the overall range of the Poisson's
   ratio values and does not demolish the Boltzmann-Volterra relation
   ability to describe non-monotonicity and sign changes of lateral strain
   and to produce negative values of the Poisson's ratio, but neglecting
   bulk creep restricts this ability significantly and reduces drastically
   the variety of possible behavior modes of lateral strain-time curves and
   the Poisson's ratio evolution and so contracts applicability field of
   the model. The model with constant bulk compliance generates only
   convex-up lateral strain-time curves which can not have minima or
   inflection points and can change sign from minus to plus only and the
   Poisson's ratio is increasing convex-up function of time (without any
   extrema or inflection points which are possible in general case) and can
   not change sign from positive to negative.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Tetra-chiral (TC) honeycombs are a type of auxetic materials showing
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), which are promising for impact energy
   absorption. This study aims to analyze the in-plane crushing response of
   the TC honeycombs under both quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions
   through numerical simulations and theoretical analyses. The numerical
   modeling techniques in LS-DYNA were validated using the quasi-static
   crush test data of TC honeycomb specimens obtained with a 3D-printer.
   Numerical simulations revealed the ``Z{''} mode deformation and the
   ``bulge effect{''} under quasi-static crushing, and the row-by-row
   ``I{''} mode deformation under dynamic crushing of the TC honeycombs. By
   referring to the simulation results, theoretical models were derived
   based on the representative unit for predicting the TC honeycomb's
   crushing strength, i.e. plateau stress, under both quasi-static and
   dynamic loads. Good agreement was found between the theoretical and the
   numerical predictions with a maximum relative error of 7\%. Parametric
   analyses showed that the unit cell configuration has a great effect on
   the crushing strength of TC honeycomb under in-plane crushing. The
   dynamic sensitivity index was defined to quantitatively evaluate the
   sensitivity of the TC honeycomb's crushing strength to the loading
   speed, and was found to depend on the unit cell geometry. The TC
   honeycomb was found to present a varied effective Poisson's ratio (EPR)
   with strain under both quasi-static and dynamic in-plane crushing;
   smaller radius ratio and lower crushing speed were found to yield more
   obvious NPR effect. Moreover, relative dimension of the TC honeycomb
   represented by the orthogonal array ratio do not affect its plateau
   stress under either quasi-static or dynamic crushing, while large
   orthogonal array ratio results in more obvious ``bulge{''} and NPR
   effects under quasi-static crushing.}},

Abstract = {{Systems with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) exhibit the unusual
   characteristic of getting fatter when stretched and thinner when
   compressed. Such behaviour is a scale-independent property and is the
   result of a cooperation between the internal geometry of the system and
   the way this deforms when uniaxially stretched. Here, we analyse the
   anisotropic mechanical properties for a system constructed from
   connected squares which can deform through changes in length of the
   sides of the squares (idealised `ystretching squares' model). In
   particular, we show that this system may exhibit a negative Poisson's
   ratio which depends on the angle between the squares and the direction
   of loading but is independent of the size of the squares which suggests
   that this model may be implemented at any scale of structure including
   the micro- and nano-level. We also show how this model compares and
   complements the existing `rotating squares' model which also works on a
   system with the same geometric characteristics and which has been shown
   to lead to auxeticity in various classes of materials.}},

Abstract = {{A variant of the auxetic helical yarn is explored herein by means of
   sewing an inextensible thin cord through an elastic fat cord, in a
   triangular pattern, to form a semi-auxetic yarn. When stretched in the
   longitudinal direction, the semi-auxetic yarn exhibits conventional and
   auxetic behavior in the plane perpendicular and parallel, respectively,
   to the plane which the inextensible thin cord lies on. A simplified
   model is developed herein to describe the effective Poisson's ratio of
   the yarn in the conventional and auxetic planes in terms of the initial
   half angle of the thin cord and the Poisson's ratio of the fat cord.
   Results show that the Poisson's ratio of the yarn in the auxetic plane
   decreases and increases with the initial half angle of the thin cord and
   the Poisson's ratio of the fat cord, respectively, while the Poisson's
   ratio of the yarn in the conventional plane increases with both
   parameters. In addition, the dominant parameters for the yarn in the
   auxetic and conventional planes are the initial half angle of the thin
   cord and the Poisson's ratio of the fat cord, respectively. Finally,
   other types of semi-auxetic yarns in the same category are proposed with
   suggested ways of producing them. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Abstract = {{We present in this work the manufacturing, modeling, and testing of
   dome-shaped cellular structures with auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio)
   behavior. The auxetic configurations allow the creation of structures
   with synclastic (i.e., dome-shaped) curvatures, and this feature is used
   to evaluate the performance of cellular metamaterials under quasi-static
   indentation conditions. We consider here different cellular geometries
   (re-entrant, arrow-head, tri-chiral, hexagonal) and the implications of
   their manufacturing using 3D printing techniques with PLA material. The
   dome-shaped configurations are modeled using full-scale non-linear
   quasi-static and explicit dynamic FE models that represent both the
   geometry and approximate constitutive models of the PLA filament
   material derived from tensile tests on dogbone specimens. The cellular
   metamaterials samples are subjected to indentation tests, with maps of
   strains obtained through DIC measurements. The correlation between
   experimental and numerical simulations is good, and shows the peculiar
   indentation behavior of these cellular structures. We also perform a
   comparative analysis by simulation of the force/displacement, strain and
   fracture history during quasi-static loading, and discuss the
   performance of the different cellular topologies for these dome-shape
   metamaterial designs.}},

Title = {{Impact of blast and mechanical loads on the shear deformable stiffened
   sandwich plate with an auxetic core layer in thermal environment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{By using the first order shear deformation theory (FSTD), this paper
   presents the results of the nonlinear dynamic behavior and natural
   frequencies of sandwich plate supported by elastic foundations in
   thermal environment and subjected to mechanical load and blast loading.
   This work takes advantage of the sandwich plate configuration with three
   layers: graphene platelet -reinforced composite (GPL) layer - auxetic
   layer - FGM layer, to analyze the dynamic and vibration problem, in
   which the auxetic core layer has a negative Poisson's ratios and the FGM
   layer is reinforced by stiffeners made of full metal or full ceramic
   depending on a situation of stiffeners at the metal-rich or ceramic-rich
   side of the plate respectively. Corresponding to the combination of
   material layers, the mechanical quantities of the problem are processed
   and calculated to suit the structure and reinforcement conditions.
   Numerical results are provided to explore the influences of geometrical
   parameters, elastic foundation parameters, GPL volume fraction, blast
   and mechanical loads on the nonlinear dynamic behavior and vibration of
   sandwich plate resting on elastic foundation and in thermal environment.
   In addition, the study is not only assumed that the material properties
   depend on environment temperature variation, but also considered the
   thermal stresses in the stiffeners, as well as considered the effect of
   imperfections in the original shape of the structure.}},

Abstract = {{Presented paper deals with experimental study on compressive properties
   of auxetics with controlled stiffness of strut joints. The variable
   strut joints properties were simulated by adding extra amount of
   material in the struts' intersection regions. Four groups of inverted
   honeycomb structures were prepared by multi-jet 3D printing and tested
   in quasi-static compression. The structure collapsed gradually, however
   after the first collapse, failure in entire cross-section occurred due
   to the brittle nature of the base material. The behavior up to the first
   collapse was consistent among the specimens within each group, while
   differed slightly subsequently. With higher reinforcement in the joints,
   results showed increasing stress at the first collapse (ultimate
   compressive stress) while the strain at the first collapse remained
   unchanged. The auxetic behaviour became less significant with increasing
   joints' reinforcement.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic simulations of single-crystal copper nanobeams, of different
   cross section sizes and with crystal-lographic orientations {[}100] and
   {[}110] along their length directions, have been performed applying
   tensile mechanical loading. The molecular dynamics code LAMMPS was
   employed for the simulations. The Poisson's ratio, which is one of the
   fundamental measures of the elastic deformation behavior of materials,
   has been determined. In this paper we present numerical evidence that
   the Poisson's ratio of nanobeams loaded by finite strains varies with
   both size and crystallographic orientation. In particular, we provide
   numerical evidence for that, of the two Poisson's ratio that naturally
   can be defined for nanobeams loaded in the {[}110]-direction, one is
   negative whereas the other one remains almost constant, irrespective of
   applied strain. We also show that for nanobeams loaded in the
   {[}100]-direction the values of Poisson's ratio initially decrease,
   reaches a minimum and thereafter increase with applied strain. For the
   smallest {[}100] cross sections the Poisson's ratios are initially
   negative, but turn positive at larger strains. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Novel Planar Auxetic Metamaterial Perforated with Orthogonally Aligned
   Oval-Shaped Holes and Machine Learning Solutions}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio have attracted much
   attention due to their counterintuitive deformation behavior over the
   conventional engineering materials. However, it is difficult to describe
   the complex correlation between microstructure parameters and auxeticity
   by analytical or empirical solutions in the form of math expressions.
   Herein, the machine learning (ML) model with artificial neural network
   (ANN) is developed to analyze a novel planar auxetic metamaterial
   designed by introducing orthogonally aligned oval-shaped perforations in
   solid base material, and its feasibility is demonstrated through the
   experimental and finite element method (FEM) solutions. It is found that
   the proposed structure involving less design parameters exhibits the
   best performance at the aspects of auxetic behavior and stress level
   than those with peanut-shaped holes and elliptic holes. Moreover, the
   results of parameter analysis demonstrate that the present ML solution
   model can provide accurate predicting results rapidly for this problem,
   without the limitations of explicit solution expressions which are
   typically not available in practice. The ML model allows one to obtain
   the desired auxetic property by tailoring the geometric parameters
   effectively and accelerate auxetic metamaterial design.}},

Title = {{Regression correlation coefficient for a Poisson regression model}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{71-78}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study examines measures of predictive power for a generalized
   linear model (GLM). Although many measures of predictive power for GLMs
   have been proposed, most have limitations. Hence, we focus on the
   regression correlation coefficient (RCC) (Zheng and Agresti, 2000),
   which satisfies the four requirements of (i) interpretability, (ii)
   applicability, (iii) consistency, and (iv) affinity. The RCC is a
   population value that is defined by the correlation between a response
   variable and the conditional expectation of the response variable. Its
   sample value is defined by the sample correlation between the observed
   response values and estimated values of the response variable. For an
   arbitrary GLM, we do not always have an explicit form of the RCC.
   However, for a Poisson regression model, assuming that the predictor
   variables have a multivariate normal distribution, we can find the
   explicit form of the RCC (true value). Therefore, it is possible to
   compare the estimators (sample values) of the RCC in terms of bias and
   RMSE (root of the mean square error) by using the true value.
   Furthermore, by using the explicit form, we propose a new estimator of
   the RCC for the Poisson regression model. We then compare the new
   estimator with the sample correlation estimator, the jack-knife
   estimator, and the leave-one-out cross validation estimator in terms of
   bias and RMSE. The leave-one-out cross validation estimator has large
   negative bias and large RMSE. Although the remaining three estimators
   show similar behavior for a large sample size, for a small sample size
   the new estimator shows the best behavior in terms of bias and RMSE. (C)

Abstract = {{Metamaterials that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio are termed as
   auxetic materials. The chiral and achiral honeycombs comprising of an
   array of cylinders connected by ligaments are one class of auxetic
   metamaterials. These structures have been investigated for their
   in-plane linear elastic behavior in the past. In this paper, novel
   bilayer tetra periodic structures are proposed by combining chiral
   and/or achiral honeycombs along the out-of-plane direction. Finite
   element (FE) models are developed for estimation of inplane linear
   Elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio. In the first step, the present FE
   model is verified with the help of experimental data for single layer
   tetra-chiral and tetra-achiral structures available in the literature.
   Subsequently, following identical methodology, the linear elastic
   constants of bilayer structures are computed. A comparison of bilayer
   tetra periodic structures with the single-layer tetra chiral/achiral
   metamaterials is presented. Further, a parametric analysis (for varied
   geometries) was performed to find a correlation between the geometry and
   mechanical behavior. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study performed on the scale-up of
   processing of negative Poisson's ratio foam. These materials become
   thinner under compression and fatter under tension, opposite to ordinary
   materials. The transformation process consists of triaxial compression
   combined with heat treatment. Transformed foam cells have a concave or
   ``re-entrant{''} shape. Scale-up is achieved by use of a modified mould
   assembled around the foam slab and longer processing times. Foam with a
   distribution of cell sizes was transformed in small block and large slab
   forms. These blocks and slabs exhibited a negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{A re-entrant honeycomb structure made from a novel solid composite based
   on recycled rubber is an innovative and sustainable solution for
   engineering applications. This work describes the tensile and failure
   behaviour of multi re-entrant honeycomb topologies consisting of width,
   thickness and angle variations. Finite element (FE) models were also
   developed to simulate tensile tests and failure behaviour of the
   cellular structures. A Taguchi design (L8) was conducted to determine
   the effect of each factor on the ultimate strength, ultimate strain,
   modulus of elasticity, Poisson's ratio and Von Mises stress. The
   experimental and FE results showed a good correlation, validating the
   numerical model which was used to perform a parametric analysis on the
   influence of the cell geometry over the failure behaviour of the
   structures. The magnitude of Poisson's ratio was significantly affected
   by the level of each cell geometric parameter. The structures with lower
   Poisson's ratio values were able to absorb more energy, and
   consequently, exhibiting less points of failure. It was found the
   thickness and the width has a significant effect on the tensile
   properties and failure behaviour. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Careful microstructural design can result in materials with
   counterintuitive effective (macroscale) mechanical properties such as a
   negative Poisson's ratio, commonly referred to as auxetic behavior. One
   specific approach to achieving auxetic behavior is to elastically
   connect structural elements with rotational degrees of freedom to result
   in elastic structures that unfold under uniaxial loading in specific
   directions, thereby giving rise to bi- or triaxial expansion, i.e.
   auxetic behavior (transverse expansion under uniaxial extension). This
   concept has been applied successfully to elastically coupled
   two-dimensional rigid rotational elements (such as rotating rectangles
   and triangles) which exhibit a negative effective in-plane Poisson's
   ratio under uniaxial (ex) tension. Here, we adopt this fundamental
   design principle but take it to the next level by achieving auxetic
   behavior in finitely strained composites made of stiff inclusions in a
   hyperelastic matrix, and we study the resulting elastic properties under
   in-plane strain by numerical homogenization. Our results highlight the
   emergence of auxetic behavior based on geometric arrangement and
   properties of the base material and demonstrate a path towards simple
   inclusion-matrix composites with auxetic behavior.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{788}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{The paper proposes an innovative concept for energy absorption in case
   of localized impacts. The concept is based on the contraction of
   cellular structures with negative Poisson's ratio under impact, which is
   combined with the energy absorption capability of a foam filler. An
   experimental assessment was accomplished considering a 3D-printed
   polymeric hexa-chiral frame filled with open-cell soft polyurethane foam
   inserts, subjected to quasistatic and dynamic indentation. The energy
   absorbed by the combination of the auxetic frame and foam is
   significantly higher than the sum of the energies absorbed by
   constituent elements tested separately. Based on the experiments, a
   numerical approach for foam-filled absorbers is developed and validated.
   Then non-linear models of metallic chiral units are considered in a
   genetic optimization process, set up to optimize the maximum frame
   contraction under compression before its failure. Finally, the
   previously validated numerical approach is applied to the optimized
   geometries, and it is shown that the foam filler can provide significant
   enhancement of specific absorbed energy and load uniformity ratio also
   for frames made of ductile metallic material.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic properties of f.c.c. hard sphere crystals with periodic

   the subject of this paper. It has been shown that a simple modification
   of the model structure is sufficient to cause very significant changes
   in its elastic properties. The use of inclusions in the form of joined
   (mutually orthogonal) layers and channels showed that the resulting
   tetragonal system exhibited a complete lack of auxetic properties when
   the inclusion spheres reached sufficiently large diameter. Moreover, it
   was very surprising that this hybrid inclusion, which can completely
   eliminate auxeticity, was composed of components that, alone, in these
   conditions, enhanced the auxeticity either slightly (layer) or strongly
   (channel). The study was performed with computer simulations using the
   Monte Carlo method in the isothermal-isobaric (NpT) ensemble with a

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{315-331}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper concerns the problem of optimal distribution of Young's
   modulus within an elastic and isotropic body with prescribed, not
   necessarily uniform, distribution of Poisson's ratio. The merit function
   is the total compliance corresponding to a given single load case. The
   unit cost of the design is assumed as the trace of Hooke's tensor, which
   is proportional to Young's modulus here. The problem thus formulated is
   a constrained version of the isotropic material design problem, in which
   both bulk and shear elastic moduli of isotropy are design variables. In
   contrast to the latter approach, the optimal material is either
   nonsingular or degenerates to a void. The optimal distribution of
   Young's modulus is determined by a solution to an auxiliary minimization
   problem with the integrand of linear growth. The problem dual to the
   latter assumes the form similar to that known from the theory of Michell
   trusses. The proposed numerical approach focuses on solving the former
   auxiliary problem. The case studies comprise selected optimal designs
   corresponding to the isotropic material optimization and Young's modulus
   optimization developed in this paper. The exemplary optimal solutions
   show that admitting negative values of Poisson's ratio may contribute to
   a decrease of the total compliance, thus leading to better designs. (C)

Title = {{Analysis of auxetic core sandwich beams subjected to transversely
   localized loads using two-dimensional symplectic elasticity approach}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF ADVANCED MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that sandwich structures containing low-density soft
   cores are susceptible to transversely localized loads. However,
   multi-parameter foundation models of the sandwich cores are extremely
   simplified when the structures are composed of auxetic materials, whose
   Poisson's ratios play very important roles in the face-core interaction.
   In this study, a two-dimensional symplectic elasticity model of a
   beam-foundation system representing sandwich beams subjected to normal
   surface tractions is formulated. The effects of the foundation
   properties, including Poisson's ratio ranging from positive to negative,
   are presented. The proposed technique is beneficial for the potential
   usage of auxetic core materials.}},

Abstract = {{The elasto-plastic indentation of auxetic and metal foams is
   investigated using the finite element method. The contributions of yield
   strain, elastic, and plastic Poisson's ratio on the indentation hardness
   are identified. For a given yield strain, when the plastic Poisson's
   ratio is reduced from 0.5, the indentation hardness decreases first and
   then increases. This trend was found to be valid for a wide of yield
   strains. For yield strains less than 0.08, the hardness of auxetic
   materials is much larger when compared with materials having positive
   plastic Poisson's ratio. As the plastic Poisson's ratio approaches -1,
   the elastic deformations dominate over the plastic deformations. The
   plastic dissipation, when compared with the elastic work, is lower for
   materials with negative Poisson's ratio. There is no effect of elastic
   Poisson's ratio on the indentation hardness when the plastic Poisson's
   ratio is more than -0.8. When the plastic Poisson's ratio is less than
   -0.8, the hardness increases with a decrease of elastic Poisson's ratio.
   The plastic dissipation per unit strain energy is maximum for materials
   with vanishing plastic Poisson's ratio.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{157}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{A558-A566}},
Abstract = {{Density functional theory (DFT) is used to reveal that the
   polycrystalline Young's modulus (E) of graphite triples as it is
   lithiated to LiC6. This behavior is captured in a linear relationship
   between E and lithium concentration suitable for continuum-scale models
   aimed at predicting diffusion-induced deformation in battery electrode
   materials. Alternatively, Poisson's ratio is concentration-independent.
   Charge-transfer analyses suggest simultaneous weakening of carbon-carbon
   bonds within graphite basal planes and strengthening of interlayer
   bonding during lithiation. The variation in bond strength is shown to be
   responsible for the differences between elasticity tensor components,
   C-ij, of lithium-graphite intercalation (Li-GIC) phases. Strain
   accumulation during Li intercalation and deintercalation is examined
   with a core-shell model of a Li-GIC particle assuming two coexisting
   phases. The requisite force equilibrium uses different Young's moduli
   computed with DFT. Lithium-poor phases develop tensile strains, whereas
   Li-rich phases develop compressive strains. Results from the core-shell
   model suggest that elastic strain should be defined relative to the
   newest phase that forms during lithiation of graphite, and Li
   concentration-dependent mechanical properties should be considered in
   continuum level models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper mainly concentrates on the design and analysis of the annulus
   with zero thermal expansion coefficient (ZTE) aiming to solve the heat
   generation and deformation in high speed bearing. First, a fork-like
   lattice cell inspired by the basic triangular cell is put forward and
   further applied to construct an annulus. The stretch-dominated lattice
   cell utilizes the Poisson's contraction effect to achieve the tailorable
   thermal expansion coefficient (CTE). The thermal behaviors differences
   between the continuous interfaces and lattice cells will lead to the
   internal stress. Thus, the CTE of the annulus consisting of the lattice
   cell can be tailored to zero even negative values through the offset
   between the thermal-strain and force-strain. Then a theoretical model is
   established with some appropriate assumptions to reveal the quantitative
   relations among the geometrical parameters, material properties and
   equivalent CTEs thoroughly. The prerequisites for realizing a zero CTE
   are further derived in terms of material limitations and geometric
   constraints. Finally FEA method is implemented to verb and analyze the
   thermal behaviors of annulus. The proposed annulus design characterized
   by the CTE tunability, structure efficiency and continuous interfaces is
   hopefully to be applied in the high speed bearings, adapters between the
   shaft and collar and fastener screws.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the advance of on-skin sensors over the last decade, a sensor
   that solves simultaneously the critical issues for using in everyday
   life, such as stable performance in various environments, use over a
   long period of time, and repeated use by easy handling, has not yet been
   achieved. Here, we introduce an auxetic hygroscopic sensor that
   simultaneously meets all of the conditions. The auxetic structure with a
   negative Poisson's ratio matches with deformation of the skin in ankles;
   hence, a conformal contact between the sensor and the skin could be
   maintained during repeated movements. Sweat was absorbed in the auxetic
   electrode made of a hydrogel pattern coated with Ag nanowires and
   evaporated quickly; such hygroscopic characteristic led to excellent
   breathability. An electrocardiogram sensor and a haptic device were
   fabricated according to the proposed design for a sensor electrode. The
   sensors provide stable detecting performance in various environments,
   such as exercising, submersion in water, exposure to concentrated salt
   water, and continuous wearing for long time (7 days). Also, the sensors
   could be manually attached repeatedly without degrading the performance.
   This study provides new structural insights for on-skin sensors and
   presents future research directions.}},

Abstract = {{Object of the paper is to show the exact analytical solutions for the
   elastic response of a solid circular cylinder composed by the assembly
   of a central core and n surrounding hollow phases, all made of different
   homogeneous elastic materials, under de Saint Venant load conditions,
   finally obtaining for the whole object an equivalent one-dimensional
   homogenized beam model. In particular, the exact solution for the case
   of combined shear and bending is new for this type of heterogeneous
   compound materials, and hence it can turn useful for the comparison with
   other classical simplified solutions widely adopted in practical
   engineering problems.
   The analytical procedure, producing overall elastic relationships
   between generalized stresses and strains for Functionally Graded
   Material Cylinders (FGMCs) in cases of axial force, torque, bending and
   shear, leads to register possible large increases of selected
   homogenized stiffness coefficients as effect of mutual interactions
   among the constituents mediated by their different Poisson ratios. The
   special case of negative Poisson ratios is then considered, envisaging
   the possibility of exploiting their relevant effects on the overall
   stiffness of the heterogeneous media in the design of new materials,
   starting from the particular microstructures or work processes. At the
   end, some example applications and sensitivity analyses are shown for
   two-phase cylinders. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Tunable Negative Poisson's Ratio in Van der Waals Superlattice}},
Journal = {{RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{2021}},
Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials are functional and mechanical
   metamaterials that shrink (expand) longitudinally after being compressed
   (stretched) laterally. By using first-principles calculations, we found
   that Poisson's ratio can be tuned from near zero to negative by
   different stacking modes in van der Waals (vdW) graphene/hexagonal boron
   nitride (G/h-BN) superlattice. We attribute the NPR effect to the
   interaction of p(z) orbitals between the interfacial layers.
   Furthermore, a parameter calculated by analyzing the electronic band
   structure, namely, distance-dependent hopping integral, is used to
   describe the intensity of this interaction. We believe that this
   mechanism is not only applicable to G/h-BN superlattice but can also
   explain and predict the NPR effect in other vdW layered superlattices.
   Therefore, the NPR phenomenon, which was relatively rare in 3D and 2D
   materials, can be realized in the vdW superlattices by different
   stacking orders. The combinations of tunable NPRs with the excellent
   electrical/optical properties of 2D vdW superlattices will pave a novel
   avenue to a wide range of multifunctional applications.}},

Title = {{An isogeometric approach to topological optimization design of auxetic
   composites with tri-material micro-architectures}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{271}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic composites, which can be viewed as a type of rationally man-made
   meta-composites with Negative Poisson's Ratios (NPRs), have received
   widespread discussions and applications because of the promising,
   multifunctional and advanced properties. Micro-architectures work as
   building blocks of unit cells to make up composites, which possess
   complex topologies of auxetic multi-material. However, it should be
   noted that a computational design approach with the reasonability and
   powerful capability of optimizing auxetic composites cells-by-cells is
   still in need, particularly for composites with three or more materials.
   In this study, the main focus is to develop an effective and efficient
   computational design framework for auxetic composites with the
   tri-material using Isogeometric Topology Optimization (ITO) method, in
   which a tri-material topology representation model is constructed by
   non-uniform rationally B-splines (NURBS) to effectively represent
   microstructural topology with clear and smooth boundaries. Numerical
   examples are discussed to present the effectiveness of the computational
   design framework, where a series of novel and interesting auxetic
   microarchitectures with the re-entrant or chiral deformation mechanisms
   can be found. The significance of the current work contributes to
   developing a platform that enables a scientific design of auxetic
   composites, rather than heavily depending on human intuition.}},

   introduced into Yukawa crystals allow one to control the elastic
   properties of the system. It has been also found that the introduction
   of the Yukawa monolayers to the hard sphere crystal induces auxeticity
   in the direction, while maintaining the negative Poisson's ratio in the
   direction, thus expanding the partial auxeticity of the system to an

Abstract = {{For the purpose of reconstructing a three-dimensional auxetic structure
   adopting spacer warp-knitting techniques, a simple mathematical model
   based on the structure of auxetic warp-knitted spacer hexagonal meshes
   was established and several samples were produced using an E22
   RD7/2-12EN warp-knitting machine. It is predicted from synthesizing the
   results of both mathematical modeling and experimental sampling that
   auxetic performance of this structure mainly depends on the contraction
   distortion before stretching in three directions, especially in the
   y-axis. When it comes to knitting parameters, yarn fineness, machine
   gauge, fabric density, movement of guide bars, and inclination angle of
   wales all matter for the auxetic performance, which is also affected by
   the stiffness of materials and the lodging of spacer yarns. It is also
   concluded that successive inlaying in the same direction of the spacer
   guide bar favors contraction distortion in the y-axis, which means
   auxetic performances can be more easily achieved in this way.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, a sandwich structure in which the Poisson ratios of the core
   and facesheets possess opposite signs has been shown to exhibit overall
   conventional and auxetic behavior depending on the loading mode axial
   loading or bending for an intermediate range of relative core thickness.
   In addition to these two loading modes, sandwich structures in aerospace
   applications encounter torsional loads. In this paper, the effective
   Poisson's ratio for torsional loading is proposed. Results show that,
   depending on the loading mode and the relative core thickness, there can
   be up to four levels of overall auxeticity, namely (i) full auxeticity
   (FA) if the structure behaves as an auxetic structure under all three
   modes of loading, (ii) high auxeticity (HA) if the structure behaves as
   an auxetic structure in two of the loading modes, (iii) low auxeticity

Abstract = {{Flexible hydrogels with an adjustable Poisson's ratio were prepared,

   flexible NFC/PEGDA hydrogels with positive, near zero, and negative
   Poisson's ratios (0.66 0.31, 0.17 +/- 0.28, and -0.39 +/- 0.26,

   photocuring. Furthermore, the effects of different curing times and mask
   apertures were investigated. The clarity and structural precision of the
   hydrogels were used to evaluate the effects of the preparation
   procedures. A curing time of 20 s and a mask aperture of 5 mm were the
   ideal conditions for preparation of NFC/PEGDA hydrogels. Further,
   addition of NFC resulted in excellent hydrogel flexibility and enhanced

Abstract = {{The nonlinear, in-plane, shear modulus of re-entrant hexagonal
   honeycombs under large deformation is analytically derived by studying
   the mechanical behavior of cell structures, which is later verified by
   numerical simulations. A nonlinear, modified factor is proposed to
   characterize the difference of the honeycomb's shear modulus under large
   and small deformation, revealing its independence from the honeycmhb's
   relative density. The effects of both strain and cell geometry on the
   honeycomb's shear modulus are investigated, exhibiting that the
   honeycomb's shear modulus increases with shear strain but decreases with
   the cell-wall-length ratio. For the effect of cell-wall angle, the
   re-entrant honeycomb's shear modulus decreases gradually with the
   cell-wall angle until reaching a minimum and then increases, which is
   highly different from the monotonically increasing relationship of
   conventional hexagonal honeycombs. When keeping the honeycomb's relative
   density constant, the re-entrant honeycomb's shear modulus monotonously
   increases with the cell-wall angle and reaches a maximum at h/l
   approximate to 3.25. Finally, the shear modulus of the re-entrant
   honeycombs is compared with that of conventional honeycombs. In contrast
   to the predictions of the classical continuum theory, the present study
   shows that the shear modulus of the re-entrant honeycomb with a negative
   Poisson's ratio is not always higher than that of the conventional
   honeycomb with a positive Poisson's ratio, which is dominated by the
   geometry of the cell structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   composite laminates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{1843-1857}},
Abstract = {{In isotropic materials, it is known that values of Poisson's ratio
   larger than one half are thermodynamically inadmissible, for such values
   would lead to negative strain energy under certain loads. Although a
   negative Poisson's ratio is not forbidden by thermodynamics, it is rare
   in crystalline solids. With the development of modem fiber reinforced
   composite materials, the effective Poisson's ratio of laminated fiber
   reinforced composites shows a peculiar behavior as it becomes larger
   than one half or less than zero.
   In this article, a study of negative in-plane Poisson's ratio for a
   general class of randomly-oriented composite laminates is presented. A
   simple random statistical analysis has been presented. It is
   demonstrated that composite laminates with negative in-plane Poisson's
   ratio could be achieved by using the specific values of independent
   elastic constants E-1, E-2, G(12), and v(12) in each lamina. Also, the
   influence of the lamina material properties to the negative in-plane
   Poisson's ratio of the composite laminates is presented. The results
   from this statistical analysis provide a set of general guidelines for
   designing composite laminates with a special character-the negative
   in-plane Poisson's ratio.}},

Title = {{Low Fatigue Dynamic Auxetic Lattices With 3D Printable, Multistable, and
   Tuneable Unit Cells}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Stress distribution has led to the design of both tough and lightweight
   materials. Truss structures distribute stress well and are commonly used
   to design lightweight materials for applications experiencing low
   strains. In 3D lattices, however, few structures allow high elastic
   compression and tunable deformation. This is especially true for auxetic
   material designs, such as the prototypical re-entrant honeycomb with
   sharp corners, which are particularly susceptible to stress
   concentrations. There is a pressing need for lightweight lattice designs
   that are dynamic, as well as resistant to fatigue. Truss designs based
   on hinged structures exist in nature and delocalize stress rather than
   concentrating it in small areas. They have inspired us to develop
   s-hinge shaped elastic unit cell elements from which new classes of
   architected modular 2D and 3D lattices can be printed or assembled.
   These lattices feature locally tunable Poisson ratios (auxetic), large
   elastic deformations without fatigue, as well as mechanical switching
   between multistable states. We demonstrate 3D printed structures with
   stress delocalization that enables macroscopic 30\% cyclable elastic
   strains, far exceeding those intrinsic to the materials that constitute
   them(6\%). We also present a simple semi-analyticalmodel of the
   deformations which is able to predict the mechanical properties of the
   structures within <5\% error of experimental measurements from a few
   parameters such as dimensions and material properties. Using this model,
   we discovered and experimentally verified a critical angle of the
   s-hinge enabling bistable transformations between auxetic and
   normalmaterials. The dynamicmodeling tools developed here could be used
   for complex 3D designs from any 3D printable material (metals, ceramics,
   and polymers). Locally tunable deformation and much higher elastic
   strains than the parent material would enable the next generation of
   compact, foldable and expandable structures. Mixing unit cells with
   different hinge angles, we designed gradient Poisson's ratio materials,
   as well as ones with multiple stable states where elastic energy can be
   stored in latching structures, offering prospects for multi-functional
   designs. Much like the energy efficient Venus flytrap, such structures
   can store elastic energy and release it on demand when appropriate
   stimuli are present.}},

Title = {{Sensitivity Improvement of Highly Stretchable Capacitive Strain Sensors
   by Hierarchical Auxetic Structures}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Highly stretchable sensors that can detect large strains are useful in
   deformable systems, such as soft robots and wearable devices. For
   stretchable strain sensors, two types of sensing methods exist, namely,
   resistive and capacitive. Capacitive sensing has several advantages over
   the resistive type, such as high linearity, repeatability, and low
   hysteresis. However, the sensitivity (gauge factor) of capacitive strain
   sensors is theoretically limited to 1, which is much lower than that of
   the resistive-type sensors. The objective of this study is to improve
   the sensitivity of highly stretchable capacitive strain sensors by
   integrating hierarchical auxetic structures into them. Auxetic
   structures have a negative Poisson's ratio that causes increase in
   change in capacitance with applied strains, and thereby improving
   sensitivity. In order to prove this concept, we fabricate and
   characterize two sensor samples with planar dimensions 60 mm x 16 mm.
   The samples have an acrylic elastomer (3M, VHB 4905) as the dielectric
   layer and a liquid metal (eutectic gallium-indium) for electrodes. On
   both sides of the sensor samples, hierarchical auxetic structures made
   of a silicone elastomer (Dow Corning, Sylgard 184) are attached. The
   samples are tested under strains up to 50\% and the experimental results
   show that the sensitivity of the sensor with the auxetic structure
   exceeds the theoretical limit. In addition, it is observed that the
   sensitivity of this sensor is roughly two times higher than that of a
   sensor without the auxetic structure, while maintaining high linearity
   (R-2 = 0.995), repeatability (>= 10(4) cycles), and low hysteresis.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral materials may exhibit negative Poisson's ratio and
   deformation-mode coupling phenomena. The finite element numerical method
   is adopted to analyze a class of 2D chiral and nonchiral materials and
   to show the effects of microstructural geometry on their effective
   elastic properties and coupling between tension/compression and bending.
   With the same area fraction (AF), nonchiral samples show larger
   effective moduli than chiral ones. The number of unit cells may reduce
   negativity in effective Poisson's ratio of the chiral samples due to
   nonuniform lateral deformation under uniaxial straining. Increasing AF
   in a hierarchical pattern in the chiral samples makes their Poisson's
   ratio more negative. Bending occurs in the chiral samples when they are
   under uniform, uniaxial, tensile, or compressive straining due to the
   coupling of deformation modes. The sensibility of tension-bending
   coupling may be controlled by the chiral microstructure. Optimization of
   the coupling sensitivity may help develop novel mechanical sensors.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a computational fatigue analysis of topology optimised
   auxetic cellular structures made of Selective Laser Melting (SLM)
   AlSi10Mg alloy is presented. Structures were selected from the Pareto
   front obtained by the multi-objective optimisation. Five structures with
   different negative Poisson's ratios were considered for the parametric
   numerical analysis, where the fillet radius of cellular struts has been
   chosen as a parameter. The fatigue life of the analysed structures was
   determined by the strain-life approach using the Universal Slope method,
   where the needed material parameters were determined according to the
   experimental results obtained by quasi-static unidirectional tensile
   tests. The obtained computational results have shown that generally less
   auxetic structures tend to have a better fatigue life expectancy.
   Furthermore, the fillet radius has a significant impact on fatigue life.
   In general, the fatigue life decreases for smaller fillet radiuses (less
   than 0.3 mm) as a consequence of the high-stress concentrations, and
   also for larger fillet radiuses (more than 0.6 mm) due to the moving of
   the plastic zone away from the edge of the cell connections. The
   obtained computational results serve as a basis for further
   investigation, which should be focused on the experimental testing of
   the fabricated auxetic cellular structures made of SLM AlSi10Mg alloy
   under cyclic loading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization of structures with complex shapes is a big challenge for
   computational physics. Results of numerical calculations show that
   composite or sandwich panel structures have a great influence on their
   effective properties. This article presents numerical results of
   optimization of sandwich panel properties. Calculations were provided
   for a three-layer sandwich two-phase composite. Optimization techniques
   were used for minimization of the effective Poisson's ratio of the core.
   The resultant composite structure exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR), although all its constituents are characterized by positive
   values of the Poisson's ratio. The structure of the composite is
   completely filled with solid materials, hence no voids appear within its
   whole volume. To find a solution, the finite-element method combined
   with an optimization algorithm MMA (method of moving asymptotes) was
   used. For the purpose of analysis, the material parameters were written
   by means of the shape interpolation SIMP (solid isotropic material with
   penalization) scheme. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Title = {{Vibration of nonlocal strain gradient beams incorporating Poisson's
   ratio and thickness effects}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{377-391}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is an extremely important physical parameter of
   materials, which can be defined as the ratio of transverse strain to
   longitudinal strain. Due to the fact that the Poisson's ratio for common
   structural materials is within a very narrow domain (i.e., from 0.25 to
   0.35), the Poisson's ratio effect on mechanical behaviors of nanobeams
   is few investigated. However, the Poisson's ratio for isotropic solids
   is from 1 to 0.5, and the structures with special Poisson's ratio,
   especially the negative Poisson's ratio, have attracted wide attention.
   Thus, it is necessary to study the Poisson's ratio effect on mechanical
   behaviors of nanobeams. Free vibration of nanobeams was performed by
   many works based on nonlocal strain gradient theory (NSGT), but most of
   them did not consider the size-dependent effect in thickness direction.
   In this study, the effects of Poisson's ratio and thickness are examined
   for the vibration behaviors of nanobeams via NSGT. Based on NSGT with
   the thickness effect, the analytical solution for the bending
   frequencies of hinged-hinged nanobeams are derived. When neglecting the
   thickness effect in NSGT, the stiffness-hardening effect is
   underestimated, especially for thin beams where the size-dependent
   effect of loss of neighboring atoms on the beam's surface is
   significant. By numerical results and the molecular dynamics simulation,
   it is found that the stiffness-hardening effect in {[}110] copper
   nanowire attenuates with an increased vibrational mode number. Moreover,
   the Poisson's ratio effect in vibration frequency of reflexyne and
   flexyne nanobeams is different. The Poisson's ratio effect in flexyne
   and reflexyne nanobeams with the thickness effect is extraordinarily
   remarkable.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper reviews 2D auxetic models, including 3D deformation models
   with 2D auxetic behavior, from mechanism perspective instead of
   geometrical perspective. On this basis, auxetic models across different
   geometrical groups can be regrouped into clusters that exhibit analogy
   in deformation mechanism. Factors that are taken into consideration
   include the identification of corresponding (i) rotation and
   non-rotation units, as well as (ii) linkages/joints between rotation and
   non-rotation units and non-linkages/non-joints across various auxetic
   models. As a result, five clusters of auxetic models have been
   identified, in which auxetic models within each cluster are analogous to
   each other. The identified clusters are those that exhibit: ( a) double
   periodicity in the rotation direction of their rotating units, (b)
   synchronized rotation direction of their rotation units, (c) single
   periodicity in the rotation direction of their rotating units, (d)
   random rotation of their rotation units, and (e) non-rotation of units.
   Results from this analogy identification place auxetic models in a
   systematic representation and will enrich future development of auxetic
   models, particularly those that do not fall within these five clusters.
   It is proposed that future work includes 3D auxetic models as well as
   ordering of analogous auxetic models according to their joints or
   linkage geometries. (C) 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors with novel mechanical behaviors and
   electronic features are highly sought for a variety of potential
   applications. In this paper, by means of first-principles theory we
   study the mechanical and electronic properties of 2D IV-VI materials in
   detail, including SiS, SiSe, and Si2SSe. We reveal that the large values
   of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) make these monolayers promising
   candidates for auxetic materials. Specifically, the in-plane NPR value
   of SiS monolayers reaches up to -0.19 in thexdirection. In addition, the
   electrons in SiS monolayers have remarkably high mobility in
   thexdirection, while the holes prefer to conduct in theydirection.
   Furthermore, under biaxial strain, the bandgaps of all these monolayers
   can be tuned effectively with ranges over 1.2 eV. All these appealing
   properties make SiS monolayers promising candidates for nanomechanic and
   optoelectronic applications.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of a quarter-space under distributed normal and shear loads
   is considered. A mathematical model is formulated for the plane strain
   state. Theoretical background of the Mellin integral transform and
   calculation of residues is outlined. An analytical procedure involving
   the Mellin transform is presented for the general reduced problem of a
   quarter-plane. Numerical computation of residues allows for evaluation
   of the inverse transforms for the displacements and stresses. Simulation
   results are obtained for a special load case: a concentrated force. The
   deformation of the loaded boundary is analyzed for various values of
   Poisson's ratio. It turns out that auxetics exhibit locally negative
   stiffness, which leads to an anomalous behavior of the system. A simple
   explanation of the unusual deformation mechanism is proposed. The
   semianalytical solutions are compared with the results obtained by means
   of the finite element method.}},

Abstract = {{An auxetic material is one which exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio; it
   expands laterally when stretched longitudinally and contracts laterally
   when compressed longitudinally. The helical auxetic yarn is a novel
   fibre structure with a diverse range of potential applications. The
   unusual mechanical properties of the yarn can be determined by
   particular combinations of geometry and component material properties.
   This paper reports on the development of low-stiffness auxetic yarns and
   fabrics which offer a range of applications such as medical devices,
   particularly bandages, compression hosiery and support garments and
   fashion apparel. The mechanical performance of the yarns and fabrics is
   elucidated, with emphasis on the ability to exploit significant changes
   through a prescribed strain range. A yarn Poisson's ratio as low as -1.5
   is demonstrated, and fabrics with in-plane and out-of-plane negative
   Poisson's ratios are illustrated. Stiffness is shown to be highly

Abstract = {{Soft materials with an embedded stiffer layer are increasingly used in
   medical and sports engineering. A detailed understanding of the
   mechanical behavior of such a material system under localised load and
   resistance to indentation is very important. In this work, the
   deformation of an isotropic soft matrix with a buried stiffer thin layer
   under a circular flat indenter was investigated through finite element
   (FE) modeling. A practical approach in simulating the indentation
   resistance of such a system (soft matrix with a buried thin stiffer
   layer) is evaluated. The numerical result is correlated with the data
   based on analytical approaches for both homogeneous materials and
   elastic half space with an embedded stiffer layer. The influence of
   Poisson's ratio and auxeticity of the matrix on the deformation and
   indentation stiffness of the material system under different conditions
   (indenter size, sheet thickness, and embedment depth) were established
   and main influences of the Poisson's ratio on the material deformation
   and stresses are discussed. The result shows that the influence of
   matrix auxeticity on indentation resistance is highly depth dependent,
   with over 30\% enhancement of the indentation resistance being predicted
   for materials with matrix of a negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular honeycombs have been widely used for a variety of engineering
   applications, from advanced aircraft design, to modern wind turbines
   where there is need for lightweight structures with high stiffness and
   strength. Functionally graded cellular structures are characterized by a
   gradual variation of cell size, shape and wall thickness over a
   prescribed volume. The gradient topology leads to a continuous
   distribution of curvatures, stiffness and energy absorption capability.
   In this work we present a numerical methodology for design of gradient
   auxetic cellular structures with a wide range of different negative
   Poisson's ratios. The proposed methodology is based on a combination of
   finite element method and a genetic algorithm. The problem is formulated
   as an optimization problem of finding cell size, shape and wall
   thickness of cellular structures with prescribed behavioral
   requirements. Different cellular structures are generated and evolved
   using the genetic algorithm and the behavior of each cellular structure
   is analyzed using the finite element method to evaluate its fitness in
   competition with other generated structures. Numerical examples show
   that it is possible to design a large number of new auxetic materials,
   each with a different value of negative Poisson's ratio. The proposed
   methodology can be used as an effective method to tailor new materials
   with prescribed values of negative (or positive) Poisson's ratio. The
   methodology can also be used to optimize other material properties.}},

Abstract = {{A series of tests have been conducted on (i) auxetic, (ii) compression
   moulded and (iii) sintered ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. The
   auxetic material possesses a negative Poisson's ratio, nu, due to its
   complex porous microstructure which consists of nodules interconnected
   by fibrils and the sintered material has a positive nu and is
   microporous but does not contain fibrils. It was found that the auxetic
   material was both more difficult to indent than the other materials at
   low loads (from 10-100 N) and was the least plastic with the most rapid
   viscoelastic creep recovery of any residual deformation. Indeed, at low
   loads, where the resistance to local indentation is most elastic, the
   hardness increased by up to a factor of 8 on changing the Poisson's
   ratio from nu approximate to 0 to nu approximate to -0.8. A mechanism is
   proposed based on local densification under the indentor of the nodules
   and fibrils which explains how the microstructural response of an
   auxetic polymer can be used to interpret the results. (C) 2000 Kluwer

Abstract = {{Soft actuators with auxetic, or negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), behavior
   offer a way to create soft robots with novel kinematic behavior. This
   paper presents an original framework for reinforcement of a soft
   actuator using a generalized NPR element, called a Representative
   Auxetic Element (RAE), and an experimental validation of the kinematic
   behavior that it enables. We build a generalized kinematic model that
   enables the design of RAE-patterned actuators and reveal the distinct
   auxetic behavior of RAE actuators with comparable model accuracy to the
   legacy McKibben actuators. A simple, reproducible way of designing and
   fabricating RAE actuators is described and varied prototypes are shown.
   This RAE-based design scheme can be used to create actuators with
   specified kinematics like bending, extension, and radial expansion,
   which can also vary across the actuator's surface both circumferentially
   and axially in a tractable, scalable manner.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{122-133}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We present a differential formulation of effective-medium model in which
   the normal and shear compliances of the high-compliance porosity are
   explicitly decoupled. This feature of the decoupled-compliance model (DC
   model) is in contrast to conventional models in which such defect's
   properties are implicitly assumed and are subject to strong limitations
   defined by the used particular crack model. Comparison with the DC model
   makes it possible to reveal such implicit assumptions in the
   conventional models. Furthermore, for the conventional cracks, our
   approach gives the same results as the conventional models. The ability
   of the DC model to incorporate arbitrary defect properties in terms of
   their normal-to-shear compliance ratio (q-ratio) is used to formulate an
   analogue of Hashin-Shtrikman constraints on the range of feasible
   crack-induced variations in the moduli. Comparison of the DC model with
   experimental pressure dependences of elastic-wave velocities in rocks
   makes it possible to extract the q-ratio for real crack-like defects.
   These results demonstrate that properties of real cracks usually
   noticeably differ from those of popular crack models such as cracks with
   free faces (e.g., penny-shape) or pure shear cracks. We discuss an
   example of sandstone with pronouncedly negative Poisson's ratio that is
   due to the fact that the ratio of normal-to-shear compliances of voids
   in this rock (q similar to 7-8) is significantly higher than for the
   conventional cracks (q similar to 2). Ability of the DC model to
   accurately extrapolate pressure dependences of the moduli from
   relatively low pressures to several times greater is demonstrated,
   including the cases, for which the conventional models give huge errors.
   The introduced parameter q the ratio of normal-to-shear compliances of
   voids provides additional insight into properties of real crack-like
   defect in rocks.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a series of in-plane hexagonal honeycombs with different
   Poisson's ratio induced by topological diversity are studied,
   considering re-entrant, semi-re-entrant and convex cells, respectively.
   The crushing strength of honeycomb in terms of Poisson's ratio is
   firstly presented. In the previous research, we have studied the
   compression performance of honeycomb with different negative Poisson's
   ratio. In this study, a comparative study on the local impact resistance
   of different sandwich panels is conducted by considering a spherical
   projectile with low to medium impact speed. Some critical criteria (i.e.
   local indentation profile, global deflection, impact force and energy
   absorption) are adopted to analyze the impact resistance. Finally, an
   influential mechanism of Poisson's ratio on the local impact resistance
   of sandwich panel is studied by considering the variation of core
   strength and post-impact collapse behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of viscoelastic and auxetic (Negative Poisson's Ratio NPR)
   layers on the free vibration modeling of a composite sandwich structure
   is analyzed in this work. For such purpose, an analytical formulation is
   performed based on the specification of kinematic theories in terms of
   displacement fields within each layer of the structure. For instance,
   simple theories like classical laminate theory (CLT) and high order
   shear deformation theory (HSDT) are considered. This enables the
   definition of a dynamic problem for 5-layered sandwich composite using
   the principle of virtual displacement. Moreover, modal parameters in
   terms of natural frequencies and associate loss factors are given
   through the transversal displacement. For linear and isotropic layers,
   numerical applications highlight the result of the Poisson's ratio on
   the modal responses. It is particular observed that the natural
   frequency and loss factor show an increase with respect to the
   auxeticity of the viscoelastic layers while no significant variations
   related to the shear function are noticed from one theory to another.

Abstract = {{A number of biological tissues have been reported as behaving in an
   auxetic manner, defined by a negative Poisson's ratio. This describes
   the deformation of tissue which expands in the axial and the transverse
   directions simultaneously while under uniaxial tension; and contracts
   axially and transversely upon uniaxial compression. The discovery of
   auxetic behaviour within biological tissues has implications for the
   recreation of the auxetic loading environment within tissue engineering.
   Tissue engineers strive to recreate the natural properties of biological
   tissue and in order to recreate the unique loading environment of cells
   from auxetic tissue, an auxetic scaffold is required. A number of
   studies have used a variety of auxetic scaffolds within tissue
   engineering. Investigation into the effect of auxetic micro-environments
   created by auxetic scaffolds on cellular behaviour has demonstrated an
   increased cellular proliferation and enhanced differentiation. Here, we
   discuss studies which have identified auxetic behaviour within
   biological tissues, and where cells have been cultured within auxetic
   scaffolds, bringing together current knowledge of the potential use of
   auxetic materials in tissue engineering applications and biomedical

Abstract = {{This paper presents a preliminary study of the dynamic performance of a
   novel light-weight auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) cellular vibration
   isolation base constituted by reentrant hexagonal honeycombs. Numerical
   and experimental analyses were conducted to reveal the effects of

   these reentrant honeycombs on the dynamic performance of this novel base
   and to propose design guidelines for the best use of the auxetic

   found that, by decreasing the relative density of reentrant honeycombs
   and increasing Poisson's ratio of them, excellent vibration isolation
   performance of the auxetic cellular base will be achieved. This analysis
   was followed by static, modal, and frequency response tests, which
   verified the results of the numerical analysis.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{183}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Wood consumption is constantly being rationalized by the production of
   modern wood-based materials, especially honeycomb plates. Due to the
   beneficial properties of the auxetics, wooden honeycomb panels with
   auxetic cores can be used as structural elements. In particularly as
   walls and partitions in wooden houses, as well as shelves and bodies for
   cabinet furniture. Thus the aim of this study was to determine rigidity,
   strength and capacity to absorb energy in novel sandwich honeycomb
   boards manufactured from beech wood with oval cells of the auxetic core.
   Samples with honeycomb boards were subjected to uniaxial compression and
   three-point bending. Based on testing results it was shown that cores of
   oval cells exhibited auxetic properties and a strong orthotropy. Density
   of honeycomb panels is below 400 kg/m3, thus they may be classified as
   lightweight boards. Thanks to a high value of the modulus of linear
   elasticity and bending strength the designed board is a good substitute
   for traditional wood-based panels. During bending honeycomb panels with
   auxetic cores more effectively absorb energy compared to the same panels
   subjected to axial compression. These investigations provide the
   foundation for further studies on optimization of the board structure
   and its applicability in industrial practice. (C) 2019 The Author.

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) materials with both ferroelasticity and negative
   Poisson's ratios have attracted intensive interest, but it is very rare
   to have both ferroelasticity and negative Poisson's ratios in a single
   material. Directional positive and negative Poisson's ratios in a
   switchable ferroelastic dielectric may enable non-destructive readout in
   ferroelastic data storage. Herein, we propose 14 kinds of stable 2D
   semiconductors: AB monolayers (A = Sc, Y, La; B = N, P, As, Sb, Bi)
   based on first-principles calculations. The band gaps of AB monolayers
   cover a wide range from 0.69 eV to 2.15 eV. Mechanical analysis reveals
   that these materials are flexible and 12 of 14 are predicted to possess
   an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). Moreover, 10 of these 14
   systems possess an out-of-plane NPR. More encouragingly, all AB
   monolayers are identified as 2D ferroelastic materials with reversible
   strains of around 5.94\% to 20.30\%. The ferroelastic switching
   barriers, mechanical properties and electronic structures of these
   materials are discussed in detail. Such outstanding properties make the
   AB monolayers very promising as switchable anisotropic 2D materials for
   nanoelectronics and micromechanical applications.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents studies on the application of the boundary integral
   equation method for investigation of dynamic stress state of negative
   Poisson's ratio foam media with tunnel cavity under the action
   non-stationary loads. In case of the plane problem, the distribution of
   normalized hoop and radial stresses were obtained for the action of
   non-stationary impulse load, which was applied to the boundary of cavity
   cross-sections. For the solution of the non-stationary problem, the
   Fourier transform for time variable was used. In Cosserat elasticity for
   the application of the boundary integral equation method the Fourier
   transform potential representations of displacements and microrotations
   were written. The fundamental functions of displacements and
   microrotations for the two-dimensional case of Cosserat continuum were
   built. For the solving of time-domain problem the system of singular
   integral equations was written. For numerical calculations the method of
   mechanical quadrature was applied. Numerical example shows the
   comparison of dynamic stress distribution in the foam medium with
   negative and positive Poisson's ratio under the action of impulse load.}},

Abstract = {{Iron-gallium alloys (known as Galfenol), are one of only a few metal
   alloys known to exhibit large auxetic or negative Poisson's ratio
   behavior. The mechanical properties, including the auxeticity, of
   Galfenol are strongly dependent on the composition. This research seeks
   to measure the elastic properties of Galfenol through a range of
   practical compositions in order to create a thorough database as well as
   present trends in the elastic properties. This is achieved through
   tensile testing of single-crystal Galfenol dog-bone-shaped specimens of
   varying compositions. For each composition, there is one specimen
   aligned along the {[}100] crystallographic axis and one aligned along
   the {[}110] axis. This project will enable future researchers to
   confidently know the elastic properties of the alloy, as well as enable
   them to select the alloy with optimum elastic properties for their
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The modes of vibrations in auxetic structures are studied, with models
   where the two-dimensional lattice is represented by a planar mesh with
   rod-like particles connected by strings. An auxetic membrane can be
   obtained modifying a honeycomb one, according to a model proposed by
   Evans et al. in 1991 and used to explain a negative elastic Poisson's
   ratio. This property means that auxetic materials have a lateral
   extension, instead to shrink, when they are stretched. The models here
   proposed with rod-like particles inserted in the structure have
   interesting behaviour of acoustic and rotational branches of phonon
   dispersions. Complete bandgaps of vibrations can be obtained for a
   proper choice of lattice coupling parameters and distribution of masses
   in the unit cell of the lattice.}},

Abstract = {{Patients who are bed-ridden and users of wheelchairs are prone to
   development of pressure sores at the cushion-skin interface due to
   stress concentrations, moisture and bacterial infections. The purpose of
   this work is to develop antibacterial auxetic polyurethane (PU) foams
   for use in seat cushions and hospital beds. Silver nanoparticles (SNPs)
   were used in the synthesis of PU foams to induce antibacterial
   properties. These foams were then converted to negative Poisson's ratio
   or auxetic polyurethane (APU) foams to improve the mechanical
   properties. Two different APU foams were made using compression factors
   of 2.07 and 2.97. Chemical composition, microstructure, thermal,
   mechanical and antibacterial properties of SNP-based PU foams before and
   after conversion to APUs were studied. The study showed that APU foams
   fabricated using higher compression factor greatly enhanced the
   antibacterial properties against gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus
   and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram negative (Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) bacteria. APU foams made using higher
   compression ratio also exhibited increase in the compression strength at
   higher strains (after 20\% strain). This study shows that the
   antibacterial APU foams developed in this work can possibly cause less
   infection and ensure better stress distribution at the cushion-skin
   interface.

Abstract = {{While the maximum bending moment, and hence maximum bending stress, of a
   fully clamped elliptical plate under uniform load is independent from
   the Poisson's ratio of the plate material, the same cannot be said so
   when the plate is simply supported. This paper develops a simple but
   sufficiently accurate model for evaluating the bending stresses along
   the principal axes of a simply supported elliptical under uniform load.
   Plotted results suggest that bending stresses at plate center along the
   longer principal axis is minimized by the use of highly auxetic
   materials if the elliptical plate is almost circular but the use of
   mildly auxetic material is preferred if the aspect ratio of the
   elliptical plate is very high. Results also reveal that bending stresses
   at plate center along the shorter principal axis is minimized when the
   plate material is highly auxetic. Upon considering the von Mises stress
   state as the effective stress, it was found that the maximum effective
   stress is reduced with the use of auxetic and conventional materials for
   simply supported elliptical plates of low and high aspect ratios,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials have attracted tremendous
   interest due to their unusual physical properties and potential

   epsilon <=-1\% but becomes negative under epsilon > 0. The deformation
   mechanism for BPO under strain depends on the mutual competition between
   the P-P attraction and P-O repulsion effect, and these two factors
   induce two different deformation pathways (one with positive PR, and the
   other with NPR). Moreover, with increasing of strain, both the decreased
   strength of P-P attraction and the increased strength of P-O repulsion
   effect modulates the PR of BPO from positive to negative.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable stents offer the potential to reduce the in-stent

   polylactic acid (PLA) vascular stents with negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) structure were manufactured by fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D
   printing in this study. The effects of stent diameter, wall thickness
   and geometric parameters of arrowhead NPR structure on radial
   compressive property of 3D-printed PLA vascular stent were studied. The
   results showed that the decrease of stent diameter, the increase of wall
   thickness and the increase of the surface coverage could enhance the
   radial force (per unit length) of PLA stent. The radial and longitudinal
   size of PLA stent with NPR structure decreased simultaneously when the
   stent was crimped under deformation temperature. The PLA stent could
   expand in both radial and longitudinal direction under recovery
   temperature. When the deformation temperature and recovery temperature
   were both 65 degrees C, the diameter recovery ratio of stent was more
   than 95\% and the maximum could reach 98\%. The length recovery ratio
   was above 97\%. This indicated the feasibility of utilizing the shape

Abstract = {{This chapter considers auxetic solids in such a form that is best
   analyzed using polar or spherical coordinate system. Specifically, this
   chapter considers the effect of auxeticity on stresses in rotating disks
   both thin and thick as well as the stresses in thick-walled cylinders
   and thick-walled spheres arising from internal and external pressure.
   Plotted results suggest that auxetic materials are advantageous over
   conventional ones for use as internally pressurized thick-walled
   cylinders, but inferior in comparison to conventional ones for
   application as thick-walled cylinders under external pressure. In the
   case of rotating thin disks with Poisson's ratio of 1/3, the
   circumferential stress is independent of the radial distance, i.e.
   uniform throughout the entire disk, but not so for rotating disks with
   central hole. The maximum stress in a thin solid disk, as well as both
   the maximum radial and circumferential stresses in a thin disk with a
   central hole, decreases linearly as the Poisson's ratio becomes more
   negative. Similar to thin rotating disks, the circumferential stress in
   thick rotating disks is independent from the radial distance when the
   Poisson's ratio is 1/3; unlike thin disks, this circumferential stress
   is not uniform throughout the entire disk, as it varies along the disk
   thickness. In addition, the radial and circumferential stresses in a
   thick rotating disk is independent from the through thickness direction
   when the Poisson's ratio is either 0 or -1. In the case of thick-walled
   spheres, the radial displacement is inversely proportional to the square
   of the radial distance if the Poisson's ratio is 0.5, but varies
   linearly to the radial distance if the Poisson's ratio is -1.}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio describes an extent of transverse deformation of a
   material when an axial strain is applied. A change of the Poisson's
   ratio from positive to negative can equip a material with a set of
   specific properties. In this paper, a study of a composite material with
   a tunable Poisson's ratio is presented. Samples of such a composite were
   first fabricated with two different polymers based on a composite
   structure proposed in our previous work using a multi-material
   additive-manufacturing system. Using both experimental and numerical
   methods, deformation mechanisms and mechanical properties of this
   composite material were analyzed. The obtained results demonstrate that
   its Poisson's ratio can be reduced by increasing the difference in
   stiffness of constituent materials and turned from positive to negative
   when this difference is sufficiently high. Additionally, the study also
   validates a possible method to fabricate composites with designed
   structures and multi-constituent materials using additive-manufacturing
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes part of a research programme that sought to provide
   a lightweight material that could be applied for structural damping
   applications. In particular this paper describes the findings of a study
   into a range of novel visco-elastic, open-celled foam materials with
   either positive or negative Poisson's ratio (i.e. auxetic). It was
   hypothesised that auxetic materials may offer additional strain energy
   dissipating mechanisms, leading to more effective structural damping
   than that offered by the conventional constrained or free-layer
   technologies that use materials with a positive Poisson's ratio. The
   materials fabricated for this study were able to provide significant
   damping when applied to thin steel plate and it was shown that the
   Poisson's ratio can affect the levels of damping obtained. The
   structural damping advantages attributed to materials with both negative
   and positive Poisson's ratio are discussed together with the strain
   energy dissipating mechanisms considered to be invoked. The study showed
   that substantial structural damping could be attributable to changes in
   thickness resonant effects controlled by the through-plane wave velocity
   and the applied foam layer thickness. Peak (thickness effect) damping
   occurs at lambda/4 and odd multiples off lambda/4 (i.e. (2n+1)lambda/4)
   resonant frequencies and the Poisson's ratio is shown to control the
   through-plane wave velocity in this case. That in turn modifies the
   thickness resonant frequency and the frequency at which peak damping
   occurs but the actual level of peak damping remains the same. Thickness
   effect damping can be very efficient over a narrow band of frequencies
   but any weight advantages over conventional damping materials will
   depend very much on the frequency range for which damping is required.
   It is suggested that control of the Poisson's ratio may be beneficial in
   certain circumstances in allowing similar damping performance but in a
   thinner layer.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of sandwich structure with auxetic 3D re-entrant
   lattice core and semi-auxetic braided composite face sheets subjected to
   high-velocity impact have been investigated. Braided carbon fiber
   composite used in face sheets of sandwich structure with a
   through-thickness negative Poisson's ratio significantly improves the
   impact performance. A semi-analytical Mori-Tanaka asymptotic
   homogenization, mechanics of structure genome, and multiscale finite
   element scheme have been applied to study the mechanical properties and
   auxeticity of the braided composite. The properties obtained at the
   lower scales are used in a macroscale progressive damage analysis and
   impact simulations of semi-auxetic braided composite. The results
   obtained have been compared with experimental data from the literature
   for validation. The sandwich core holds further scope for tailoring its
   architecture that can enhance the sandwich performance. The
   high-velocity steel ball impact response of the sandwich structure with
   two types of auxetic 3D re-entrant lattice core have been simulated and
   compared with a non-auxetic core. Parametric studies have been performed
   at the mesoscale to study the influence of lattice angle on homogenized
   effective properties of the core. Compared to non-auxetic foam, proposed
   auxetic sandwich structures are lightweight, have better energy
   absorption and high stiffness values in the in plane along with
   out-of-plane directions. A case study of trauma plate for the
   application of proposed auxetic lattice reinforced polyethylene

Abstract = {{In this study, the crushing behavior of auxetic structures built from
   inverted tetrapods with linearly graded porosity under impact is
   analyzed both experimentally and computationally. The auxetic samples
   with linearly graded porosity are fabricated from Ti-6Al-4V alloy powder
   by the selective electron-beam melting method. A detailed geometrical
   analysis of the fabricated samples based on micro computed tomography
   (microCT) scans is performed to determine the variation of strut
   thickness and other fabrication imperfections. The samples are subjected
   to high strain rate compression loading in two specimen orientations
   (specimens with low or high porosity facing the impacting plate) using
   the powder gun. Appropriate computational models are later developed and
   validated to provide a more detailed insight into the crushing mechanism
   of auxetic structures during impact. The experimental and computational
   results show dependency of the plateau stress inclination
   (progressive/regressive) on the gradation of the auxetic cellular
   structures (specimens with low or high porosity in front). These initial
   results prove that it is possible to tailor the mechanical behavior of a
   porous structure with introduction of graded porosity, especially in the
   case of high strain rate impact, where the main deformation occurs at
   the impacting front.}},

Abstract = {{The cotton boll weevil Anthonomus grandis Boheman (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae) is the main pest in cotton crop around the world,
   directly affecting cotton production. In order to establish a sequential
   sampling plan, it is crucial to understand the spatial distribution of
   the pest population and the damage it causes to the crop through the
   different developmental stages of cotton plants. Therefore, this study
   aimed to investigate the spatial distribution of adults in the
   cultivation area and their oviposition and feeding behavior throughout
   the development of the cotton plants. The experiment was conducted in
   Maracaju, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014
   growing seasons, in an area of 10,000 m(2), planted with the cotton
   cultivar FM 993. The experimental area was divided into 100 plots of 100
   m(2) (10 x 10 m) each, and five plants per plot were sampled weekly
   throughout the crop cycle. The number of flower buds with feeding and
   oviposition punctures and of adult A. grandis was recorded throughout
   the crop cycle in five plants per plot. After determining the
   aggregation indices (variance/mean ratio, Morisita's index, exponent k
   of the negative binomial distribution, and Green's coefficient) and
   adjusting the frequencies observed in the field to the distribution of
   frequencies (Poisson, negative binomial, and positive binomial) using
   the chi-squared test, it was observed that flower buds with punctures
   derived from feeding, oviposition, and feeding + oviposition showed an
   aggregated distribution in the cultivation area until 85 days after
   emergence and a random distribution after this stage. The adults of A.
   grandis presented a random distribution in the cultivation area.}},

Abstract = {{It is commonly believed that furniture spring systems are far more
   durable and friendly to use than foam systems. The aim of this research
   project was to design and realise models of individual auxetic
   compression springs and determine their resistance to cyclic as well as
   prolonged static loads. The study was conducted using numerical
   calculations and verification of results by laboratory experiments. The
   results of the performed investigations made it possible to conclude
   that the designed spring had stiffness characteristics similar to the
   compression characteristics of polyurethane foams. Cyclical and
   prolonged static loads have no significant influence on changes in
   spring heights; their impact on the comfort of seating is insignificant.
   New construction of springs guaranteed the auxetic properties of systems
   made up of many parallel-joined spring systems. Due to such properties,
   seats designed using auxetic springs can exhibit high comfort levels in
   comparison with traditional systems made of wire springs or foams.}},

Abstract = {{This work proposes a topology optimization design method of
   metamaterials for improving the vibration reduction performance.
   Firstly, an optimization mathematical model of the functional element is
   established with the objective of maximizing the origin mechanical
   impedance level, and the functional element with optimal vibration
   reduction effect is obtained by the calculation of the mathematical
   model. Then, the optimized functional elements are periodically arranged
   to generate the metamaterials, and thus a series of metamaterials with
   negative Poisson's ratio ranging from - 0.5 to - 2.0 are designed.
   Numerical simulation shows that the amplitudes of the acceleration
   response are reduced by 66.5\% after the vibration is passed through the
   metamaterials. Comparison shows that the novel designed metamaterials
   achieve at least 12\% improvement in vibration reduction performance
   over the traditional honeycomb.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{188}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Multi-stable mechanical metamaterials with unprecedented
   mechanical/physical properties have attracted great interests due to
   their functional applications for advanced materials and devices.
   However, the original curved/tilted bistable snapping segments in most
   of those existing multi-stable mechanical metamaterials cause unequal
   bistability/multi-stability. The relative thicker supporting segments
   can't provide complete constraints at the end of snapping segments using
   single parent material. To achieve completely symmetric
   bistable/multi-stable mechanism, an innovative design strategy is
   proposed based on interlocking assembly method with multimaterials and
   compressed buckled snapping segments for bistable units. Theoretical
   analysis, numerical simulations and experimental verifications are used
   to show completely symmetric bistability/multi-stability with negative
   stiffness. The multi-stable mechanical metamaterials have robust
   shape-reconfigurability and zero Poisson's ratio with large recoverable
   deformation. Geometric and material gradients design are carried out to
   control deterministic deformation sequence with rich programmability.
   Theoretical and numerical results reveal that tunable ID to 3D large
   positive/zero/negative isotropic or anisotropic thermal expansions of
   single 1D to 3D multi-stable metamaterials can be achieved,
   respectively. This work suggests the rational designed metamaterials
   with multi-abnormal-index and the potential applications of
   multi-functional metamaterials. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by

   analysis and conceptual design of mechanical meta materials. The
   methodology is inspired by recent advances in the insightful syntheiis
   of compliant mechanisms by visualizing a kinetostatic field of forces

   flow behavior in the microstructure geometry to the global behavior of
   the materials, such as auxetic (negative poisson's ratio), high bulk
   modulus, and high shear modulus. This understanding is used to
   synthesize and demonstrate novel planar microstructures that exhibit
   negative poisson's ratio behavior. Furthermore, the paper identifies
   three unique classes of qualitative design problems for planar
   mechanical microstructures that can be potentially solved using this
   framework.}},

Abstract = {{This technical brief considers bending stress minimization as a basis
   for obtaining the optimal Poisson's ratio of simply supported
   equilateral triangular plates under (a) bending loads at the plate
   boundary, (b) uniform load throughout the entire plate, and (c)
   concentrated load at the plate center. Results suggest that the use of
   auxetic materials is not appropriate for triangular plates under applied
   bending at the boundary, while mildly auxetic and highly auxetic
   materials are appropriate for triangular plates under uniform and
   central point loads, respectively. In addition, obtained results show
   that the optimal Poisson's ratios for circular and square auxetic plates
   are not necessarily applicable for triangular plates. The use of auxetic
   materials offers an additional choice for decreasing bending stresses
   under specific boundary conditions and loading patterns.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports an experimental investigation on the effect of
   auxeticity towards impact loads. Both conventional and auxetic
   polyurethane (PU) foams were subjected to impact drop tests, and the
   damaged surfaces were visually inspected. Although it is known that
   auxetic materials resist indentation due to densification along the load
   line, experimental impact tests on conventional and auxetic PU foams
   reveal that auxetic foams are not necessarily advantageous over
   conventional ones for very high impact. This paper proposes a
   geometrical model that resembles the microstructure of auxetic foams, as
   well as elucidates both the auxetic behavior and the limiting strength

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study vibro-acoustic behavior of auxetic sandwich
   panels subjected to different excitations and boundary conditions. The
   core of this panel has the auxetic feature (with negative Poisson's
   ratio or NPR) with anti-tetrachiral honeycomb structure. Mechanical
   behavior of the core is formulated using theoretical relations presented
   for this kind of auxetic. Using the Finite Element Method, the modal
   analysis and spectral analysis of the structure are accomplished.
   Different random colored noises are applied as the system excitation.
   First, a parametric study is performed; and some interesting results are
   observed from investigating the effects of geometric parameters,
   boundary conditions, and noise color on the vibro-acoustic behavior of
   the structure. These parameters affect the natural frequencies, level of
   radiated sound, and mass of the structure. An optimization algorithm is
   applied to the geometrical parameters in order to simultaneously reduce
   the level of radiated sound and preserve the amount of total mass. By
   the use of the Genetic Algorithm (GA), we could achieve a remarkable
   noise attenuation gain. It is shown that the GA choses different
   optimized parameters for the structure according to the location of the
   load and frequency content of the load spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{Designing new two-dimensional (2D) materials, exploring their unique
   properties and diverse potential applications are of paramount
   importance to condensed matter physics and materials science. In this
   work, we predicted a novel 2D SN2 monolayer (S-SN2) by means of density
   functional theory (DFT) computations. In the S-SN2 monolayer, each S
   atom is tetracoordinated with four N atoms, and each N atom bridges two
   S atoms, thus forming a tri-sublayer structure with square lattice. The
   monolayer exhibits good stability, as demonstrated by the moderate
   cohesive energy, all positive phonon modes, and the structural integrity
   maintained through 10 ps molecular dynamics simulations up to 1000 K. It
   is an indirect-bandgap semiconductor with high hole mobility, and the
   bandgap can be tuned by changing the thickness and external strains (the
   indirect-bandgap to direct-bandgap transition occurs when the biaxial
   tensile strain reaches 4\%). Significantly, it has large Young's modulus
   and three-dimensional auxetic properties (both in-plane and out-of-plane
   negative Poisson's ratios). Therefore, the S-SN2 monolayer holds great
   potential applications in electronics, photoelectronics and mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures are attracting increasing interest because of their
   large variety of applications at both the macro and micro scales. In
   this work, an innovative auxetic unit cell is presented, numerically
   studied, fabricated at the microscale and experimentally tested. Its
   versatility in terms of stiffness and Poisson's ratio and its
   compatibility with commercial Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)
   fabrication processes suggest applications such as motion conversion and
   amplification mechanism in MEMS devices or on-chip biaxial tests. A MEMS
   auxetic and periodic structure exhibiting an overall equivalent
   Poisson's ratio lower than -1 is then proposed. The static and dynamic
   behaviours are studied both numerically and through a simplified
   analytical model. Experimental results confirm the simulated behaviour
   of the structure thus verifying the first MEMS auxetic structure with
   electrostatic actuation and capacitive readout.}},

Abstract = {{Barium chalcogenides are known for their high-technological importance
   and great scientific interest. Detailed studies of their elastic,
   mechanical, dynamical and thermodynamic properties were carried out
   using density functional theory and plane-wave pseudo potential method
   within the generalized gradient approximation. The optimized lattice
   constants were in good agreement when compared with experimental data.
   The independent elastic constants, calculated from a linear fit of the
   computed stress strain function, were used to determine the Young's
   modulus (E), bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G), Poisson's ratio
   (sigma) and Zener's anisotropy factor (A). Also, the Debye temperature
   and sound velocities for barium chalcogenides were estimated from the
   three independent elastic constants. The calculations of phonon
   dispersion showed that there are no negative frequencies throughout the
   Brillouin zone. Hence barium chalcogenides have dynamically stable
   NaCl-type crystal structure. Finally, their thermodynamic properties
   were calculated in the temperature range of 0-1000 K and their
   constant-volume specific heat capacities at room-temperature were
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{A novel hierarchical metamaterial with tunable negative Poisson's ratio

   RUC are applied as adjustable design variables to explore
   structure-property relations. Finally, the effects of the design
   parameters on mechanical behavior and relative density are
   systematically investigated, which indicate that high specific stiffness
   and large auxetic deformation can be remarkably enhanced and manipulated
   through combining parameters of both subordinate cell and parent RUC. It

Abstract = {{A band gap region, or simply a band gap, is a range of frequencies where
   vibrations of certain frequency ranges are isolated. In the present
   paper, such ranges are sought through the study of different cases for
   the shape of the unit cells of a lattice, i.e., of an assembly of
   classical structural elements, such as beams and plates. A lattice with
   a specific, special designed microstructure is considered in the present
   investigation. Each particular cell of the examined lattice is studied
   as a classical composite material consisting of a matrix and the
   reinforcing core (e.g., matrix-fiber composite), and it is discretized
   by using two-dimensional plane stress finite elements. The form of the
   core of the unit cells can be of several shapes, e.g., quadratic,
   circular, and star. Some of these shapes provide the whole lattice with
   auxetic behavior, with negative Poisson's ratio at the homogenized
   properties. The shape and the microstructure of the lattice is optimized
   in order to achieve isolation of the desired frequencies. A first
   attempt on the optimization of star-shaped microstructures is also
   presented. The optimization is carried out using powerful global
   optimization methods, such as the genetic algorithms. Results indicate
   that band gaps may appear in both conventional and auxetic
   microstructures. Moreover, the appearance and the size of the band gaps
   depend on the selected microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{Honeycomb structures have been used extensively in lightweight sandwich
   structure and impact energy absorption applications. Recently the
   research has been carried out on auxetic honeycombs that have negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR). Auxetic structures are attractive for various
   engineering applications because of their unique mechanical properties,
   volume change control and excellent impact energy absorption
   performance. In this study, novel design and performance improvement of
   new auxetic-strut structures were presented. A comparative study of
   in-plane uniaxial compression loading behavior of regular honeycomb,
   re-entrant auxetic honeycomb, locally reinforced auxetic-strut structure
   and a hybrid structure of combining regular honeycomb and auxeticstrut
   structure was conducted on 3D printed samples. The deformation and
   failure modes of the different cells were studied and their performance
   was also discussed. The new auxetic-strut structure showed better
   mechanical properties than the honeycomb and auxetic structure. For
   example, the compressive strength of the auxeticstrut design is similar
   to 300\% more than that of honeycomb structure and similar to 65\% more
   than that of auxetic structure. With lower values of the Poisson's
   ratio, the new design can absorb more energy when compared to the other
   structures. Hybrid structure of auxetic-strut and honeycomb cells allows
   us tailor the deformation paths to provide desired failure modes. (C)

Title = {{Auxetic polymeric bone plate as internal fixator for long bone
   fractures: Design, fabrication and structural analysis}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{819-833}},
Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Injuries cover about 11\% of World's Disease Burden
   depicting fractures to be the leading severe consequence of trauma.
   Fractures occur due to force impact or osteoporosis. Fracture healing is
   a complicated process. Fracture fixation techniques focus on imparting
   reduction to fractured fragments and induce healing. When considering
   possible fixation methods, the aspect of micro-movement is an important
   one, as this induces callus formation which tends to be a crucial step
   for fracture healing. Internal fixation of long bone fractures using
   metallic plates has been carried out since decades and recently
   advancements have been in synthesizing biodegradable plates as well. The
   purpose of this research was to fabricate an Auxetic Polymeric Bone
   Plate that can be used as an internal fixator for long bone fracture;
   this bone plate renders micro-movement due to its counter intuitive
   behavior, has the potential to reduce the effect of stress shielding and
   allow the same range of motion as that of natural bone.
   METHODS: Polyurethane was chosen as a material for the fabrication of
   the Auxetic device because of its biocompatibility and non-toxic
   effects. The plate was then tested for mechanical properties such as
   Tensile and Compression testing to determine the strength.
   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The tensile testing of the Auxetic polyurethane
   specimens showed that the mean of the Poisson's ratio of the samples
   lies between -0.68 and -0.87 at different uni-axial tensile load values.
   The Auxetic structure of our device has the potential to allow for
   efficient fixation because its negative Poisson's ratio offers
   micro-movement, thereby causing fixation with relative stability rather
   than absolute stability. The Auxetic bone plate can be superior to
   contemporary plate fixation systems, as it demands meaningfully small
   contact points. The suitable mechanical properties might lessen stress
   shielding effects that are normally caused by rigid bone plates. The
   Auxetic nature of the bone will help align and sustain the bone
   fragments with small fracture gaps in order to impart appropriate
   assembly to accomplish bone healing.}},

Abstract = {{Negative hypergeometric distribution arises as a waiting time
   distribution when we sample without replacement from a finite
   population. It has applications in many areas such as inspection
   sampling and estimation of wildlife populations. However, as is well
   known, the negative hypergeometric distribution is over-dispersed in the
   sense that its variance is greater than the mean. To make it more
   flexible and versatile, we propose a modified version of negative
   hypergeometric distribution called COM-Negative Hypergeometric
   distribution (COM-NH) by introducing a shape parameter as in the
   COM-Poisson and COMP-Binomial distributions. It is shown that under some
   limiting conditions, COM-NH approaches to a distribution that we call
   the COM-Negative binomial (COMP-NB), which in turn, approaches to the
   COM Poisson distribution. For the proposed model, we investigate the
   dispersion characteristics and shape of the probability mass function
   for different combinations of parameters. We also develop statistical
   inference for this model including parameter estimation and hypothesis
   tests. In particular, we investigate some properties such as bias, MSE,
   and coverage probabilities of the maximum likelihood estimators for its
   parameters by Monte Carlo simulation and likelihood ratio test to assess
   shape parameter of the underlying model. We present illustrative data to
   provide discussion.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with specific microstructural characteristics and composite
   structures are able to exhibit negative Poisson's ratio. This fact has
   been shown to be valid for certain mechanisms, composites with voids and
   frameworks and has recently been verified for microstructures optimally
   designed by the homogenization approach. For microstructures composed of
   beams, it has been postulated that nonconvex shapes (with reentrant
   corners) are responsible for this effect. In this paper, it is
   numerically shown that mainly the shape, but also the ratio of
   shear-to-bending rigidity of the beams do influence the apparent
   (phenomenological) Poisson's ratio. The same is valid for continua with
   voids, or for composites with irregular shapes of inclusions, even if
   the constituents are quite usual materials, provided that their porosity
   is strongly manifested. Elements of the numerical homogenization theory
   and first attempts towards an optimal design theory are presented in
   this paper and applied for a numerical investigation of such types of

Abstract = {{Solids that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio are called auxetic
   materials. Static behavior of the auxetic-porous structures has not been
   investigated so far, especially for structures composed of multi
   directional heterogeneous materials. The two parameter elastic
   foundation (Pasternak type) is developed by taking into account the
   torsional interaction and horizontal friction force. The material
   properties of the plate except the Poisson's ratio are assumed to be
   graded in the thickness and radial directions according to exponential
   functions. The governing state equations are derived in terms of
   displacements based on 3D poroelasticity theory. These equations are
   semi-analytically solved using state-space based differential quadrature
   method. A detailed parametric study is carried out to highlight the
   influences of key parameters on the static response of non-uniform
   bi-directional functionally graded auxetic-porous material (FGAPM)
   circular plates to compound mechanical tractions. Finally, the static
   response of circular plates composed of various functionally graded
   materials to compound mechanical loads is compared. Results reveal that
   the auxeticity of the material, torsional couples on the plate and
   rotary interaction of the elastic foundation play important roles on the
   static behavior of the plate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{An auxetic (or negative Poisson's ratio) material expands in all
   directions when pulled in only one, behaving in an opposite way compared
   with ``classical{''} materials. A structure not super-imposable with its
   mirror image is defined as chiral. A chiral structural honeycomb
   (noncentresymmetric) features auxeticity, i.e., a negative Poisson's
   ratio behaviour in the plane. Although chirality is common in nature and
   organic chemistry, it is an unusual characteristic in structural
   materials and components. We have manufactured truss assemblies based on
   cells of chiral honeycomb topology using shape memory alloy (SMA)
   ribbons as core material. The main objective of this work is to obtain a
   new functional structure combining the chiral honeycomb topology and
   shape memory alloys as a new concept of smart cellular solid. The chiral
   SMA honeycomb can be used in new types of deployable antenna reflectors,
   allowing the compression of the structure in a small volume of space for
   subsequent deployment. The new honeycomb concept could also be used in
   packaging applications to store strain energy during an impact loading

   optimization approach with polygonal finite elements}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{69-80}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Compliant mechanisms are monolithic structures where the movement is
   given by the flexibility of the structure rather than the presence of
   joints and pins. The absence of joints allows the construction of
   compliant mechanisms in microscale. In this work, the compliant
   mechanism is designed by using topology optimization to generate
   microstructure unit cells that simulate the effect of auxetic materials,
   i.e. those with negative Poisson's ratio. Polygonal finite element
   meshes are introduced in the topology optimization formulation to avoid
   the hinges (one-node connections) in the compliant mechanism design. A
   pattern repetition constraint is applied to generate auxetic
   macrostructures. An integrated approach that combines a projection
   technique with a mapping technique is adopted to include the minimum
   member size constraint, making the topology optimization results
   possible to be manufactured. The connection of the topology optimization
   approach with additive manufacturing is demonstrated using 3D printers
   based on FFF (fused filament fabrication) and PolyJet technologies.
   Thus, computational simulation in connection with rapid prototyping are
   carried out to verify the results.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In materials science and engineering, auxetic behavior refers to
   deformations of flexible structures where stretching in some direction
   involves lateral widening, rather than lateral shrinking. We address the
   problem of detecting auxetic behavior for flexible periodic
   bar-and-joint frameworks. Currently, the only known algorithmic solution
   is based on the rather heavy machinery of fixed-dimension semi-definite
   programming. In this paper we present a new, simpler algorithmic
   approach which is applicable to a natural family of three-dimensional
   periodic bar-and-joint frameworks with three degrees of freedom. This
   class includes most zeolite structures, which are important for
   applications in computational materials science. We show that the
   existence of auxetic deformations is related to properties of an
   associated elliptic curve. A fast algorithm for recognizing auxetic
   capabilities is obtained via the classical Aronhold invariants of the
   cubic form defining the curve. Related algorithmic alternatives are also
   considered. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   tendency to lower (or even negative) out-of-plane Poisson's ratio. New
   experimental data of porcine arterial layer under uniaxial tension in
   orthogonal directions are also presented and compared with the
   theoretical predictions and other literature data. The results point out
   the typical features of recent constitutive models with fibres
   concentrated in circumferential-axial plane of arterial layers and their
   potential inconsistence with some experimental data. The volumetric

   indentation}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{107-118}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Spherical indentation has a unique deformation pattern and shows a
   different deformation behavior compared with other kinds of
   indentations. In this paper, a special feature of the loading curve for
   spherical indentation was found, the loading curve transforms from
   concavity to convexity. The traditional Meyer's law failed to cover the
   transition phenomenon accurately, so a cubic-polynomial empirical model
   was proposed based on experiment results and theoretical analysis.
   Comparison results proved that this model gave a good description to the
   both loading curve and tangent slope curve of spherical indentation.
   Further study was conducted using the proposed model and finite element
   simulation method. Parameters including hardening index(n), elastic
   modulus(E) to yield stress(Y) ratio, Poisson's ratio(v), indenter
   radius(R) and friction coefficient(mu) were analyzed on their influence
   on the shape of loading curve. It was found that n had a decisive
   influence to the concavity-convexity transition phenomenon. When n <=
   0.1 the quadratic coefficient C-2 will be negative and the
   concavity-convexity transition phenomenon will never occur. When n >
   0.1, the loading curve transforms from concavity to convexity. Further
   studies found that two deformation patterns i.e. vertical indenting and
   radial expansion were the reason of the concavity convexity transition
   phenomenon. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of auxetic structural elements undergoing transverse shear
   deformation has so far been largely confined to the first-order shear
   deformation theory (FSDT), which requires a shear correction factor;
   analysis using the third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT), which
   does not require a shear correction factor, is currently lacking in
   regard to auxetic structural elements. This paper adopts the TSDT to
   evaluate the elastic stability of isotropic columns with special
   emphasis on auxetic ones for pinned-pinned columns with springs of equal
   rotational stiffness at both ends. Results on columns with pinned-pinned
   (zero stiffness) and fixed-fixed (infinite stiffness) end conditions
   with square and circular cross sections reveal that auxeticity (i)
   reduces the transverse shear deformation, (ii) allows the use of
   classical theories, and (iii) provides higher elastic stability. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THERMODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{154}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The elastic anisotropy and thermodynamic properties of MB12 (M = Hf, Y,
   Zr and Sc) compounds have been investigated by combining the first
   principles with the quasi-harmonic Debye model. The negative values of
   cohesive energy indicate these compounds are thermodynamic stability.
   The results of elastic constants and elastic modulus explain that these
   compounds exhibit high hardness and strong antiuniaxial stress ability.
   But the Vickers hardness values are all lower than that of the
   traditional threshold for superhard material (40 GPa). The BIG ratio and
   Poisson's ratio v reveal that all MB12 compounds are brittle at 0 GPa.
   ZrB12 and HfB12 possess similar fracture toughness, while ScB12
   possesses the lowest one. The 3D contours of the Young's modulus of four
   materials are very similar at both 0 GPa and 100 GPa. Also, pressure can
   increase the anisotropy for MB12 compounds. The pressure and temperature
   dependence of the heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient and Debye
   temperature of MB12 compounds are also comprehensively discussed. These
   findings are of great value for the applications of these
   multifunctional materials in electromechanical and medical engineering.

Abstract = {{Auxetic architectures with a negative Poisson's ratio have attracted
   increasing attention due to their intriguing physical properties and
   numerous promising applications and recent advancements in manufacturing
   techniques. However, fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) polymeric
   auxetic architectures with a tailored hierarchically porous structure
   and desired physical/mechanical properties remains challenging. Herein,
   3D nanofibrous Kevlar aerogel architectures with porosity at multiple
   scales have been designed and fabricated through a new additive
   manufacturing strategy,i.e., integration of direct ink writing and
   freeze-casting with non-toxic solvent-based inks followed by special
   drying techniques. The highly porous 3D nanofibrous Kevlar aerogel
   architectures achieve excellent mechanical properties with an ultralow
   density (down to 11.9 mg cm(-3)) and large specific surface area (up to
   350 m(2)g(-1)). The Poisson's ratio is tunable in a wide range, spanning
   from -0.8 to 0.4, by adjusting the spatial arrangement of the designed
   pattern struts. Finally, these nanofibrous Kevlar aerogel architectures
   have been further functionalized into hydrophobic, luminescent and
   thermoresponsive architectures by using fluorocarbon resin, functional
   dyes and organic phase-change materials respectively. The
   multi-functional auxetic aerogel architectures demonstrate potential for
   a broad range of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Previously open cell polyurethane foams have been made to be re-entrant,
   in that their cell ribs are inwardly bent, which results in the foam
   exhibiting a negative Poisson's ratio((1)). Untransformed control and
   transformed negative Poisson's ratio foams were cyclically loaded at
   various levels of pre-strain to determine their hysteresis behaviour,
   and from this, to elucidate their specific damping characteristics. Both
   untransformed and transformed foams exhibited non-linear hysteresis
   behaviour at high cyclic strains, regardless of their initial levels of
   pre-strain. The specific damping capacity of the transformed foam with
   extreme compressive pre-strain was higher than that of the untransformed
   foam. This effect was attributed to the rubbing of the inwardly buckled
   cell ribs of the transformed foam. The specific damping capacity varied
   with both the level of pre-strain and with the amplitude of cyclic
   strain about that level.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRASHWORTHINESS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{689-698}},
Abstract = {{The finite element method has been used to investigate the
   crashworthiness of regular conventional and re-entrant cellular foams in
   pristine and defect forms. Defects were introduced by randomly deleting
   vertical ribs (cell walls), diagonal ribs and vertical-plus-diagonal
   ribs from the honeycomb models, which with suitable boundary conditions
   approximated to three-dimensional foams. Generally, the calculations
   show that deleting ribs leads to a reduction in magnitude of the Young's
   moduli and Poisson's ratios, although there are some notable exceptions.
   In particular, the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio along the x-axis
   (perpendicular to the vertical ribs) actually increase in magnitude
   slightly when vertical ribs are deleted. In the case of the re-entrant
   honeycomb, a transition from auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) to
   non-auxetic (positive Poisson's ratio) behaviour occurs at a critical
   threshold for diagonal rib deletion. For the conventional honeycomb, the
   Poisson's ratio for loading in the y-direction remains approximately
   constant when diagonal ribs are deleted.}},

   metamaterials}},
Journal = {{POLYMER TESTING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{81}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and structures as a class of metamaterials have been
   extensively studied and evaluated for many applications. This paper
   focuses on the vibration damping mechanisms of composite
   three-dimensional double-arrow-head (3D DAH) auxetic metamaterial. The
   composite 3D DAH auxetic structures are made from carbon fiber
   reinforced polymer (CFRP) using an assembly method. The damping
   performances of this structure is characterized by compressive
   loading-unloading tests and sine sweep frequency experiments. Damping
   parameters and energy consumptions in unit volume are analyzed
   synthetically to explore the contribution of various damping mechanisms.
   The results show that the structure consumes more energy with the strain
   level increase, but the augment is not large; structural hysteresis
   energy dissipation due to the large deformation is not related to the
   loading speed; the contribution of macroscopic frictional energy and
   elastic buckling energy consumption is much greater than that of
   intrinsic material damping energy dissipation. It is observed that the
   Poisson's ratio of such structures is approximately linear with the
   comprehensive evaluation factor and vibration transmissibility per unit
   height respectively. The comparison in the performance of conventional
   structure materials shows that the 3D DAH structure has excellent
   comprehensive characteristics of light weight, high specific strength
   and high damping performance.}},

Abstract = {{Systems with negative Poisson ratio (NPR) behave in a counterintuitive
   way: when pulled (pushed) in one direction, they expand (shrink) in all
   directions. In this lecture we discuss application of computer
   simulations to study NPR systems and sketch an idea - based on the
   Cauchy relations - of systematic studies of mechanisms which may lead to
   NPR. Roughly speaking, the NPR systems can be divided into three groups:
   (i) systems of artificial structures (on micro-, mezo- or macroscopic
   scale), (ii) systems at special conditions (e.g. systems at negative
   pressure, systems near some phase transitions, etc.), and (iii)
   thermodynamically stable phases. We concentrate on the third group and
   study a class of two-dimensional model particles forming isotropic solid
   phases which exhibit the NPR. Depending on the interaction potential
   used, they show periodic or aperiodic structures. The Poisson ratio of
   the aperiodic solids can be decreased by transforming them into periodic
   crystals.}},

Abstract = {{An elastic layer slides on a rigid flat governed by Coulomb's friction

   the sliding localizes within stick-slip pulses, which transform into
   opening waves propagating at intersonic speed in the direction of
   sliding or, for high Poisson's ratios, at supersonic speed in the
   opposite direction. This sliding mode, characterized by marginal
   frictional dissipation, and similar to carpet fold propagation, may
   result in inversion of the frictional force direction; at longer time
   intervals, the system demonstrates stick-slip behavior. The mechanism is

Title = {{Design and modelling of auxetic double arrowhead honeycomb core sandwich
   panels for performance improvement under air blast loading}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{In the present study, a 2D-based large-scale metallic auxetic double
   arrowhead honeycomb core sandwich panel (DAHSP) was proposed and its
   deformation response, energy dissipation characteristics and associated
   mechanisms under air blasts were investigated using a validated
   numerical model. It aims at the performance improvement of DAHSPs
   through the design of core relative density with respect to different
   strategies. The DAHSPs considered mainly experienced a local dome
   superimposed upon global deformation of front face and global
   deformation of back face, while the core webs were heavily buckled and
   progressively collapsed. The results confirmed the material
   concentration effect of DAH cores induced by the negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR). It was found that the panel deformation response was highly
   related to their deformation/failure mechanisms. Relative to core web
   thickness, the increase of number of core layers led to a more
   remarkable decrease in permanent deflections. However, the decline of
   inclined angles not always reduced the back face deflection due to the
   competition between enhanced bending stiffness and deteriorated local
   contact force. An ideal means to decrease the panel deformation is to
   enlarge the inclined angles at low relative density but to decrease the
   horizontal distance when the relative density increases to a high level.
   The panel with thinner core webs at low relative density and the panel
   with narrowed inclined angles at high relative density is more
   beneficial to plastic energy absorption. In addition, a core
   configuration with a thinner tendon but a thicker stuffer promoted the
   exploitation of NPR and further improved the panel energy absorption.}},

Abstract = {{The hexachiral structure is in-plane isotropic in small deformation.
   When subjected to large elasto-plastic deformation, however, the
   hexachiral structure tends to lose its auxeticity and/or
   isotropy-properties which are desirable in many potential applications.
   The objective of this study is to improve these two mechanical
   properties, without significantly compromising the effective yield
   stress, in the regime with significant material and geometrical
   nonlinearity effects. It is found that the deformation mechanisms
   underlying the auxeticity and isotropy properties of a hexachiral
   structure are largely influenced by the extent of rotation of the
   central ring in a unit cell. To facilitate the development of this
   deformation mechanism, an improved design with wavy ligaments is
   proposed. The improved performance of the proposed hexachiral structure
   is demonstrated. An initial study on possible applications as a
   protective material is next carried out, where the improved hexachiral
   design is shown to exhibit higher specific energy absorption capacity
   compared to the original design, as well as standard honeycomb
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is produced
   via a novel thermal processing route consisting of three stages:
   compaction, sintering and extrusion. The latter stage, extrusion, is
   investigated in this paper, with particular reference to the effects of
   die geometry (cone semi-angle, exit diameter and capillary length) and
   extrusion rate on the ability of the polymer to produce an extrudate
   with a negative Poisson's ratio. It was found that a delicate balance
   must be achieved between the production of an extrudate which lacks
   structural integrity and one which is solid but possesses a conventional
   positive Poisson's ratio i.e. does not exhibit the nodule-fibril
   microstructure necessary for auxetic behaviour.
   In conjunction with the results from the first two papers in this
   series, it is possible to define a set of conditions required to produce
   auxetic UHMWPE.}},

   Glasses}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In glass materials, Poisson's ratio (nu) has been proposed to be
   correlated with a variety of features, including atomic packing density
   (C-g), liquid fragility (m), and network connectivity. To further
   investigate these correlations in oxide glasses, here, we study cesium
   borate and cesium silicate glasses with varying modifier/former ratio
   given the difference in network former coordination and because cesium
   results in relatively high nu compared to the smaller alkali modifiers.
   Within the binary glass series, we find positive correlations between nu
   on one hand andmandC(g)on the other hand. The network former is found to
   greatly influence the correlation between nu and the number of bridging
   oxygens (n(BO)), with a negative correlation for silicate glasses and
   positive correlation for borate glasses. An analysis based on
   topological constraint theory shows that this difference cannot be
   explained by the effect of superstructural units on the network
   connectivity in lithium borate glasses. Considering a wider range of
   oxide glasses from the literature, we find that nu generally decreases
   with increasing network connectivity, but with notable exceptions for
   heavy alkali borate glasses and calcium alumino tectosilicate glasses.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to understand the effect of auxeticity on shear
   deformation in thick plates. Three models for the shear correction
   factor of plates as a function of Poisson's ratio were proposed: an
   analytical model, a cubic fit model and a modified model. Of these
   three, the cubic fit model exhibits the best accuracy over the entire
   range of Poisson's ratio from -1 to 0.5. The extent of shear deformation
   is herein investigated using the example of uniformly loaded circular
   plates. It was found that the maximum deformation of such plates based
   on Mindlin theory approximates to those according to Kirchhoff theory
   when the Poisson's ratio of the plate material is highly negative. When
   the Poisson's ratio of the plate material is -1 and the edge of the
   plate is simply supported, the calculation of the maximum deflection by
   Mindlin theory simplifies into that by Kirchhoff theory. These results
   suggest that auxeticity reduces shear deformation in thick plates,
   permitting the use of classical plate theory for thick plates only if
   the plate material is highly auxetic.}},

Abstract = {{Under uniaxial compression (tension), auxetic materials would shrink
   (expand) laterally. It has been speculated that the auxetic property
   could be used to design superior nails for easier push-in and harder
   pull-out. In this study, the first auxetic nails are designed,
   fabricated and experimentally investigated. Pine timber and
   mediumdensity fibreboard are selected as testing materials. The push-in
   and pull-out performance of auxetic and nonauxetic nails is compared by
   using two key parameters of the maximum compressive force and the
   maximum tensile force. It is found that the auxetic nails do not always
   exhibit superior mechanical performance to nonauxetic ones. Also, the
   small auxetic deformation of one typical designed auxetic nail is
   revealed by the experimentally validated finite element model. The
   experimental and numerical results illustrate the limitations of
   exploiting the auxetic property in the nail application. Some
   suggestions are provided for more effective designs of future auxetic
   nails.}},

Abstract = {{In the present research, free vibration of circular and annular sandwich
   plates with auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) cores and
   isotropic/orthotropic face sheets is investigated for different
   combinations of the boundary conditions. To ensure that the results are
   accurate and reliable, a global-local layerwise plate theory is employed
   instead of the traditional equivalent single-layer theories. The
   governing equations are derived based on Hamilton's principle and solved
   using a Taylor transform whose center is located at the outer radius of
   the plate. Due to this hint, the resulting semi-analytical solution can
   be employed for both circular and annular sandwich plates. After
   investigation of vibration behavior of a single-layer annular auxetic
   plate, a comprehensive parametric study including evaluation of effects
   of the auxeticity for sandwich plates with isotropic and orthotropic
   face sheets, symmetric and asymmetric layups, different core to sheet
   thickness, radius to thickness, and inner to outer radius ratios, and
   various boundary conditions, is carried out. Results show that unlike
   the single-layer auxetic plates that exhibit a transition state, the
   auxeticity may considerably increase the natural frequencies and
   rigidities of the circular/annular sandwich plates, especially when the
   boundary conditions induce higher rigidity in the plate or when the
   fibers are along the radial direction. Accuracy of results of the
   employed layerwise theory and the proposed semi-analytical solution is
   verified by comparing the results with those of the three-dimensional
   theory of elasticity extracted from the ABAQUS software.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper uniaxial tension of two-dimensional auxetic cellular
   structures is studied experimentally. Various samples were made by the
   laser cutting method from nonauxetic polyethylene terephthalate (PET-A
   amorphous) planes of size 112.5 x 24 x 0.7 mm with central area of 28 x
   24 x 0.7 mm. The transverse size of elements of hexagons was equal to
   sample thickness. The samples were subjected to monotonous uniaxial
   tension until the last moment when they still remained plane. Comparison
   of mechanical properties of the defect-free cellular structures
   consisting of concave hexagons with straight elements and concave
   hexagons in which part of straight elements is replaced with curvilinear
   elements is given as a result of experimental analysis. Cellular
   structure with straight elements showed lower value of Poisson's ratio
   in comparison with cellular structure with curvilinear elements.
   Influence of defects on mechanical properties of cellular structure with
   curvilinear elements is studied. We conclude that for the considered
   samples of cellular structure with curvilinear elements at uniaxial
   tension, loss of one horizontal element (near the center of the sample)
   changes effective mechanical properties much less than for the case of
   same structure with one vertical element being absent. As a result,
   tensile force -displacement diagram for four samples was calculated from
   the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Systems with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic) exhibit the unexpected
   feature of expanding laterally when uniaxially stretched and becoming
   narrower when compressed. Here, we examine the role of the tetrahedra
   found in the frameworks of the predicted auxetic zeolites natrolite
   (NAT), thomsonite (THO) and edingtonite (EDI) for generating negative
   Poisson's ratios in an attempt to relate the auxeticity in the (0 0 1)
   plane to rotations of the tetrahedra in the zeolite framework. The
   behavior of the tetrahedra is then examined in terms of their 2D
   projections in the (0 0 1) plane and we show that in the extreme
   scenario, where the three-dimensional tetrahedra in the zeolite
   framework are perfectly rigid and simply rotate relative to each other,
   then their 2D projected behavior in the (0 0 1) plane becomes equivalent
   to the idealized two-dimensional `rotating squares model' with a
   Poisson's ratio of -1. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Close-in blast resistance of large-scale auxetic re-entrant honeycomb
   sandwich panels}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{The protection of critical infrastructure, including government
   buildings, airports, religious buildings, military buildings and
   military vehicles, which are at risk to blast loads, has become
   important due to increasing terrorist activities in recent years.
   Sacrificial cladding systems based on negative Poisson's ratio core
   topologies have recently received more attention as a protective
   technology due to its excellent energy absorption capability. In this
   study, field blast tests were performed on metallic re-entrant
   honeycomb-cored sacrificial cladding systems as protective structures
   for steel plate structures. This study focused on the near-field blast
   loading conditions where liquid Nitromethane (NM) spherical charges were
   detonated in close proximity to the main structure. Two 6 mm thick mild
   steel plates and two steel plates protected with re-entrant
   honeycomb-cored sacrificial cladding systems were among the specimens
   tested. The proposed auxetic cladding system was fabricated from
   aluminium sheets using a novel in-house built folding machine. Numerical
   simulations were conducted utilising LS-DYNA software and the Blast
   Impact Impulse Model (BIIM). The results obtained from the numerical
   simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results. It was
   found that the deformation pattern of the sacrificial auxetic cladding
   system varies with the intensity of the blast loading, and there is a
   limit at which the proposed protective system ceases to effectively
   absorb the applied blast loading. The variation of negative Poisson's
   ratio of the system with blast loading was studied. It was found that
   the auxetic cladding system could become a solid projectile leading to
   damage amplification for very close-range blast loads due to rapid
   densification of the auxetic core. The proposed cladding systems with
   narrow re-entrant angles performed well under blast loads due to
   relatively low stiffness of the panels. Finally, the optimisation study
   was performed for the protective system. Overall, the experimental and
   numerical results assure that auxetic-based cladding systems are
   suitable for applications requiring blast protection such as armoured
   vehicles and critical physical infrastructure but need to be carefully
   designed for the given blast threat to prevent overloading of the
   protected structures.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{125}},

Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{The discovery of auxetic behavior (negative Poisson's ratio) within
   elements and alloys had focused attention on their elastic anisotropy in
   an effort to understand the range of crystal orientations that manifest
   this property. A comparison of elastic constant data to atomistic models
   based on pair-wise, central force models provides key insights into
   deformation behavior of cubic crystals over a wide range of anisotropy,
   including, for the first time, those with Zener anisotropy ratios less
   than 1. A simple criterion is derived which dictates all cases in which
   a crystal whose atomic ordering obeys cubic symmetry will display
   auxetic deformation, where the extrema in Poisson's ratio involves (110)
   orientations. In the field of stress determination through x-ray
   diffraction, these findings also shed light on strain anisotropy in
   polycrystalline materials, where the elastic incompatibility between
   adjacent grains alters their overall deformation. By applying these same
   atomistic models, we can predict the Voigt/Reuss weighting fractions
   associated with Kroner limit x-ray elastic constants for cubic
   materials, a necessary component in quantifying stress using diffraction
   data. We also establish that greater elastic anisotropy in a constituent
   crystal leads to a more rigid mechanical response in the corresponding
   polycrystalline aggregate, with implications for auxetic crystal
   ensembles. Published under license by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Several foams of different cell-size, including Scott Industrial
   polyurethane foam with large cells (20 pores per inch, ppi, or 1.2 mm
   per pore, black), medium cells (65 ppi, or 0.4 mm per pore, green), and
   near-microcellular (100 ppi, 0.25 mm per pore, white), were processed
   over various time and temperature regimes to ascertain the role of cell
   size in transformation to negative Poisson's ratio materials. These
   foams were transformed successfully, and exhibited negative Poisson's
   ratio behavior. Poisson's ratio was measured using a new laser based
   setup. For all as-received (unprocessed) foams with different cell
   sizes, Poisson's ratio decreased with compressive axial strain and
   increased with tensile strain up to a maximum. The maximum Poisson's
   ratio In tension decreased as cell size increases. The strain at which
   maximum Poisson's ratio occurs, increased with cell size. In negative
   Poisson's ratio foams, minimum Poisson's ratios of -0.8, -0.5, and -0.4
   for 20 ppi, 65 ppi, and 100 ppi foams, respectively were observed.
   Furthermore, the cell size effects on transformation parameters were

Title = {{Assessment of negative Poisson's ratio effect on the postbuckling of
   pressure-loaded FG-CNTRC laminated cylindrical shells}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS BASED DESIGN OF STRUCTURES AND MACHINES}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the postbuckling behaviors of pressure-loaded
   laminated cylindrical shells made of carbon nanotube reinforced
   composite (CNTRC) under thermal environmental conditions. The shell has
   negative in-plane or out-of-plane effective Poisson's ratio (EPR). The
   thermo-mechanical properties of CNTRCs are temperature dependent. The
   CNT volume fraction of the shell is in a piece-wise functionally graded
   (FG) distribution across the shell thickness. The extended rule of
   mixture (EROM) model is applied to determine the thermo-mechanical
   properties of CNTRCs. Based on the framework of the Reddy's third order
   shear deformation shell theory and the von Karman-type of kinematic
   assumptions, the governing partial differential equations for
   pressure-loaded CNTRC laminated cylindrical shells are formulated. The
   thermal environmental condition effect is also included. The
   postbuckling solution for pressure-loaded FG-CNTRC laminated cylindrical
   shell is obtained in the asymptotic sense by means of a singular
   perturbation technique in associate with a two-step perturbation
   approach. Numerical investigations are carried out for the (10/60/10)(S)
   shell including in-plane NPR effect, and (20/-20/20)(S) and
   (70/-70/70)(S) shells including out-of-plane NPR effect. Assessment is
   presented through numerical comparisons.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, 2D triangular anti-trichiral structures and auxetic
   stents, under compression, were introduced. The cores of the
   anti-trichiral structures were the equilateral triangles. The
   deformation mechanisms in 2D structures were based on the rotation of
   the triangles and bending of the ligaments. A parametric study was
   carried out to investigate the dependence of the Poisson's ratio to the
   triangle edge lengths. The most auxeticity, with the values of v(yz )= -
   0.55 and v(zy) = - 1.6, was obtained in the structure in which the
   triangle edge lengths were considered 13 mm. Next, the auxetic stents
   with the aims of uniform shrinkage behaviors as well as high energy
   absorption were introduced. For this purpose, the equilateral triangles
   were distributed on the cylindrical surfaces along with the peripheral
   and longitudinal directions. Under compression, the stent with 15mm
   triangle edge lengths possessed uniform shrinkage behavior, and the
   values of Poisson's ratio were measured v(zx) = - 2.2 and v(zy) = -
   2.19. Finally, the comparisons between triangular and conventional
   anti-trichiral stents were performed. It was observed that the lateral
   displacements, as well as energy absorption of the triangular stents
   were twice and three times as high as the conventional anti-trichiral
   stents respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The crustal thickness (H) and Poisson's ratio (v) are important for
   understanding the plate motion and the interior earth structure. We
   collected teleseismic receiver functions of earthquakes, which occurred
   from 2001 to 2008, from 75 permanent seismic stations of Guangdong and
   Fujian networks. In total 74 estimations of H and v were obtained by
   making use of the H-kappa method. Combining with characteristics of the
   fault distribution, seismicity and topography, several conclusions were
   achieved below. (1) Crustal thickness ranges from 26 to 32 km, reducing
   from land to sea and from north to south. Poisson' s ratio is 0. 23
   similar to 0. 28, increasing from land to sea. Variations of H and v
   have positive and negative correlations with surface topography,
   respectively. (2) Fault activity correspond to the block-like and
   band-shaped distributions of H and v. Transitional variation zones of H
   and v spread in accordance with seismicity. Earthquake clusters and
   mantle upwelling are generally corresponding to the rapid increasing of
   v. (3) Crustal rocks in this area manly consist of intermediate and
   acidic minerals. Crustal thicknesses are positively and negatively
   related to Poisson's ratio under actions of extensional tectonics
   offshores and thrusting structure in folded regions, respectively,
   revealing the diversified evolution models in different eras and

   negative magnetic anomalies were found on the Menderes Massif and in the
   southern part of the Marmara sea. Higher heat flow values were also
   obtained from these regions. The negative correlation values can be seen
   on a profile taken along the 28 E longitude and are sourced from a large
   graben system which has been generated as a result of lithospheric
   extension in Western Anatolia since the Early Miocene. The grabens were
   filled up by approximately 2000-m-thick sediments. The negative

Abstract = {{In this study, three-dimensional tomographic studies of crustal seismic
   wave velocity structure beneath the Tibetan Plateau were carried out
   using seismic travel time data from China Digital Seismograph Network
   (CDSN) (2009-2016) seismic stations. The three-dimensional S-wave
   velocity structure and Poisson's ratio distribution of the Tibetan
   Plateau with a resolution of 1 degrees X 1 degrees X 20 km were
   obtained. The results show that the negative anomalous zones of S-wave
   velocity and high Poisson's ratio zones could be found from the upper
   crust to the lower crust under the high-potassium and potash volcanic
   belts of Kekexili and northern Qiangtang. This indicates that during the
   Tertiary Tibetan Plateau uplift, the East Kunlun Triassic suture zone
   reruptured due to continental collisions, resulting the upwelling of
   massive crust-mantle mixed molten material and volcanic eruption. This
   further reveals that the existence of Cenozoic volcanic belts in the
   northern Tibetan Plateau is closely related to the formation and uplift
   of the Tibetan Plateau. The Cenozoic rift zones of the Tibetan Plateau
   are located at both sides of the S-wave velocity negative anomaly zones
   in middle-lower crust, the Poisson's ratio below the rift zones in
   middle-lower crust are less than 0. 22. From the anomalous distribution
   of S-wave velocity and Poisson's ratio in middle-lower crust under the
   Cenozoic rift zones of Tibetan Plateau, it could be deduced that the
   Cenozoic rift of Tibetan Plateau had reached the bottom of the middle
   crust. This is consistent with the conclusions from the crustal density
   imaging study of the Tibetan Plateau using gravity inversion. The S-wave
   velocity and Poisson's ratio of the Tibetan Plateau change sharply with
   depth from lower crust to crust-mantle boundary, which indicates that
   large-scale interlayer detachment and horizontal shear occurred in the
   crust. The Poisson's ratio of the eastern tectonic syntaxis in the
   Tibetan Plateau is as high as 0. 29-0. 33, and the S-wave velocity
   perturbation under eastern tectonic syntaxis is negative. This infers
   that the crust below the eastern tectonic syntaxis is mainly composed of
   hard serpentinized peridotite. The negative anomalous zones of the
   S-wave velocity in the middle and lower crust of the Tibetan Plateau is
   widely expanded, and the bottom of the crust under Tibetan Plateau is
   almost covered by the negative anomalous zones of the S-wave velocity.
   Such characteristic of distribution of anomalous of the S-wave velocity
   may reflect the influence of pipeline flow in the lower crust.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{We analyse the propagation of elastic waves in soft materials subjected
   to finite deformations. We derive explicit phase velocity relations for
   matter with pronounced stiffening effect, namely Gent model, and apply
   these results to study elastic wave propagation in (a) nearly
   incompressible materials such as biological tissues and polymers, (b)
   highly compressible and (c) negative Poisson's ratio or auxetic
   materials. We find, that for nearly incompressible materials transverse
   wave velocities exhibit strong dependence on the direction of
   propagation and initial strain state, whereas the longitudinal wave
   velocity is not affected significantly until extreme levels of
   deformation are attained. For highly compressible materials, we show
   that both longitudinal and transversal wave velocities depend strongly
   on deformation and direction of propagation. Moreover, the dependence
   becomes stronger when stiffening effects increase. When compression is
   applied, the longitudinal wave velocity decreases regardless the
   direction of wave propagation in highly compressible materials, and
   increases for most of the directions in materials with negative
   Poisson's ratio behaviour. We demonstrate that finite deformations can
   influence elastic wave propagation through combinations of induced
   effective compressibility and stiffness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{98}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) is a counterintuitive material elastic
   constant that can lead to many unusual auxetic properties. Here, using
   first-principles calculations, we report tunable negative Poisson's
   ratio in the out-of-plane direction in group-IV monochalcogenide
   monolayers MX (M = Sn, Ge and X = S, Se). SnSe, GeS, and SnS monolayers
   have intrinsic NPR v(zx) ranging from -0.004 to -0.210 in armchair (x)
   tension, whereas GeSe monolayer possesses a much larger NPR v(zy) of
   -0.433 in zigzag (y) tension. Our analysis attributes the NPR effects to
   the relative position of M and X in the puckered structure and the
   smaller bending stiffness of M-X-M bond angle. We further established
   the correlation between electronic structures of materials and their
   crystal structures. It allows us to fine tune GeSe structure via
   electron doping, leading to a reversible and continuous change of v(zy)
   from -0.821 up to 0.895. We also demonstrate the concept of strain
   engineering GeSe monolayer to switch its Poisson's ratio v(zx) between
   two different values: 0.583 and -0.433. Our in-depth study provides not
   only fundamental knowledge but also practical routes for designing 2D
   smart materials with tunable negative Poisson's ratio, which are
   desirable for smart devices at small scale.}},

   The finite element method and plane wave expansion method are used to

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials, also known as auxetic
   materials, have many promising application areas. In recent years,
   various auxetic material structures have been designed and fabricated
   for diverse applications that utilized normal materials which follow
   Hooke's law but still show the properties of negative Poisson's ratios.
   In light of this, efforts are made to apply auxetic material structures
   to body protection pads that are comfortable to wear and effective in
   protecting body parts by reducing impact force and preventing injuries
   in high-risk individuals such as elderly people, industry workers, law
   enforcement and military personnel, and sport players. For those people,
   blunt impacts such as falls, bullets, and blast wave may reduce quality
   of life, increase the possibility of early death and generate an
   extremely high medical costs. Therefore, it is important to develop new
   body protectors that best combine each individual's requirements of
   wearing comfort (flexible, light weight), ease of fitting (customized),
   ensured protection, and cost-effectiveness. The developed protection pad
   would be made from multilayer materials with an adaptive structure to
   achieve a unique multifunctional properties such as high hardness,
   impact toughness, light weight, excellent shock absorption,
   self-assembly suitable for the needs.
   Particularly, an integrated computational (finite element analysis)
   approach is used to investigate the effect of three material structures
   (honeycomb or flexin structure, re-entrant hexagonal cells or reflexin
   structure, and arrowhead structure) in combination with three polymeric
   materials (Polylactic acid (PLA) and two thermoplastic polyurethane
   (TPU) materials). Efforts are made to relate the individual and/or
   combined effect of auxetic structure and materials to the overall
   stiffness and shock-absorption performance of the body protection pads.
   Initially, parametric 3D CAD models of auxetic polymeric structures are
   developed. Later, key structural characteristics of protectors are
   evaluated through static analyses of FEA models. Impact/shock analyses
   are conducted to validate the results obtained from the static analyses.
   The mechanism for ideal input force distribution or shunting is
   suggested for designing protectors using various shapes, thicknesses,
   and materials of auxetic materials to reduce the risk of injury. The
   results show that the auxetic material can be considered as an effective
   material structure for body protection pads.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-structured materials consisting of an array of microstructures are
   engineered to provide the specific material properties. This present
   work investigates the design of cellular materials under the framework

   homogenization method (EBHM) is applied to evaluate the material
   effective properties based on the topology of the material cell, where
   the effective elasticity property is evaluated by the average stress and
   strain theorems. Secondly, a parametric level set method (PLSM) is
   employed to optimize the microstructural topology until the specific
   mechanical properties can be achieved, including the maximum bulk
   modulus, the maximum shear modulus and their combinations, as well as
   the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The complicated topological shape
   optimization of the material microstructure has been equivalent to
   evolve the sizes of the expansion coefficients in the interpolation of
   the level set function. Finally, several numerical examples are fully
   discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method. A

   more ductile response with more than four times larger failure strain.
   The AISI316L steel provides for a much more ductile response than
   AlSi10Mg at comparable normalised load-carrying capability. The samples'
   deformation behaviour was analysed with the digital image correlation
   and tracking method, where it was shown that hexachiral samples exhibit
   a lower Poisson's ratio. The experimental results were used to validate
   the corresponding computational models, providing a more detailed
   analysis of deformation behaviour. They allow for cost-effective
   parametric studies and the development of new optimised chiral
   geometries.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional regular theoretical units that give a negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) are well documented and well understood. Predicted
   mechanical properties resulting from these models are reasonably
   accurate in two dimensions but fall down when used for heterogeneous
   real-world materials. Manufacturing processes are seldom perfect and
   some measure of heterogeneity is therefore required to account for the
   deviations from the regular unit cells in this real-life situation.
   Analysis of heterogeneous materials in three dimensions is a formidable
   problem; we must first understand heterogeneity in two dimensions. This
   paper approaches the problem of finding a link between heterogeneous
   networks and its material properties from a new angle. Existing
   optimisation tools are used to create random two-dimensional topologies
   that display NPR, and the disorder in the structure and its relationship
   with NPR is investigated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Models of smectic-C liquid-crystal elastomers predict that they can
   display soft elasticity, in which the shape of the elastomer changes at
   no energy cost. The amplitude of the soft mode and the accompanying
   shears are dependent on the orientation of the layer normal and the
   director with respect to the stretch axis. We demonstrate that in some
   geometries the director is forced to rotate perpendicular to the stretch
   axis, causing lateral expansion of the sample-a negative Poisson's
   ratio. Current models do not include the effect of imperfections that
   must be present in the physical sample. We investigate the effect of a
   simple model of these imperfections on the soft modes in monodomain
   smectic-C elastomers in a variety of geometries. When stretching
   parallel to the layer normal (with imposed strain) the elastomer has a
   negative stiffness once the director starts to rotate. We show that this
   is a result of the negative Poisson's ratio in this geometry through a
   simple scalar model.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures, which have a negative Poisson's ratio, have good

   impact loading was investigated. For the in-plane (x and y) and
   out-of-plane (z) directions, boxes with an auxetic honeycomb structure
   were produced by material extrusion method using Power ABS filament. In
   the experimental study, dynamic tests were carried out with a drop test
   machine. Besides, explicit analyses were performed by creating finite
   element models for these 3 directions. The experimental and numerical
   results have shown that the energy absorption property of auxetic
   honeycomb geometry is superior in the case of out-of-plane loading, in

Abstract = {{Chiral auxetic cellular structures were fabricated from Ti6Al4V alloy
   using the Selective Electron Beam Melting method, and tested
   experimentally under quasi-static and dynamic compression loading
   conditions. The experimental results were used to validate built
   computational models of auxetic cellular structure in LS-DYNA. The
   models were used to study the geometry effect on the Poisson's ratio of
   the analysed chiral auxetic structure. The response of sandwich
   composite panels with auxetic core under blast loading was studied
   extensively computationally, where the maximum panel displacement and
   the Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) of the composite panel were
   evaluated. Three different methods for blast loading (ConWep, Smooth
   Particle Hydrodynamic, Multi-Material Arbitrary Lagrange-Eulerian) were
   compared and validated based on the experimental data. It was determined
   that larger thickness of the cover plate lowers the panel maximum
   displacement, while the SEA is larger when thinner cover plates are
   used. Also, it was shown that the chiral unit cell amplitude effect on
   the maximum displacement and SEA is, in most analysed cases, negligible
   in comparison to the cell length effect, which is more prominent. The
   presented study illustrates great potential of using sandwich structures

Abstract = {{The cellular structure can exhibit many special mechanical behaviors due
   to its variable cell shape. A three-dimensional compression-twist cell
   structure based on the rotation mechanism of two-dimensional chiral cell
   structure is developed, which has twist deformation under axial
   compression. The shape of three-dimensional compression-twist cell
   structure is determined through cell angle, cell length, and thickness
   ratio. Analytical expressions of effective Young's modulus, Poisson's
   ratio, and twist angle are derived by using beam theory, which have a
   good agreement with the finite element calculations and the deformation
   process of the cell is discussed. To work on the effect of geometric
   parameters of cell on the mechanical properties, a finite element
   analysis model of compression-twist cell structure is carried out, which
   shows the process of elastic and plastic deformation under compression.
   Effects of cell angle, cell length, and thickness ratio are fully
   discussed, which indicate that cell angle has obvious nonlinear effect
   on relative twist angle and could stiffen it. Finally, a
   compression-twist cell structure sample is made through
   three-dimensional printing, and an in-plane compressive experiment is
   carried out to prove analytical and finite element analysis results.}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, not only the effect of cell-wall thickness on the
   deformation mode of metallic auxetic reentrant honeycomb was firstly
   studied, but also the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect on the
   crushing stress was also clarified by the quasi-static compressive
   experiments. Firstly, two types of typical reentrant hexagonal
   honeycombs with thin-walled and thick-walled cells were manufactured and
   compressive tests were carried out to characterize the deformation
   modes, negative Poisson's ratio distribution and crushing stress.
   Experiment results showed that the deformation mode of thin-walled
   honeycomb was quite different from that of thick-walled honeycomb, which
   has not been found in the existing reported papers. Secondly, a finite
   element (FE) model of the reentrant honeycomb was established and the FE
   results were systematically compared with the experimental results. The
   effects of honeycomb cell's number on the compressive deformation and
   the crushing stress of the honeycomb were studied. The results showed
   that once the honeycomb contained more than four cells in both
   transverse and horizontal directions, both the compressive deformation
   and the crushing stress were close to the experimental results. Finally,
   the energy absorption characteristics of reentrant honeycomb during
   compression were discussed. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by

   performed on wet samples, without XRD on dry samples. The tensile
   strength, the modulus of elasticity (MOE), and the elongation at

   the microfibril angle (MFA) and the deformation of crystalline cellulose
   by monitoring the reflections 200 and 004. The (X-ray) Poisson ratio of
   crystalline cellulose was calculated, both before and after the yield
   point. The tensile strength and the MOE of the wet samples were
   significantly lower than in the dry samples. The tensile properties of
   dry samples were similar to dry earlywood samples of untreated Norway
   spruce. The MFA only showed notable changes due to strain when it was
   initially large, when a diminishing effect was observed. The Poisson

Abstract = {{Developments in technology require the new materials, lighter and more
   efficient structures and also new manufacturing methods. In this study,
   after doing researches about topology optimization, regular honeycomb
   and re-entrant structures; the regular honeycomb and re-entrant
   structures were designed, and then Ti-6Al-4V material was chosen for
   these structures in finite element (FE) analyzing. The three different
   rib thickness values (t) of 1 mm, 1.5 mm and 2 mm were assigned for
   honeycomb and re-entrant structures in FE analyses. Also, the crack was
   created on the models, and then 2-D FE analyses were done for both
   cracked and un-cracked honeycomb and re-entrant structures under tensile
   forces through y axis. Afterwards, the effect of crack on stress
   intensity factor, stresses, strains and displacement were obtained and
   characterized the auxetic behavior of the regular honeycomb and
   re-entrant structures. Furthermore, increase in rib thickness decreases
   stress and strains for each structure. Moreover, re-entrant structures
   have negative Poisson's ratio due to their geometric properties and the
   notable effect of crack on the equivalent stress in re-entrant was
   emerged in comparison with honeycomb structure. As a result, the only
   possible fracture in honeycomb for thickness of 1 mm might be observed
   owing to stress intensity factor obtained from analyses bigger than
   fracture toughness of honeycomb structure.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate and rapid prediction of materials' physical properties,
   such as thermal transport and mechanical properties, are of particular
   importance for potential applications of featuring novel materials. We
   demonstrate, using graphene as an example, how machine learning
   potential, combined with the Boltzmann transport equation and molecular
   dynamics simulations, can simultaneously provide an accurate prediction
   of multiple-target physical properties, with an accuracy comparable to
   that of density functional theory calculation and/or experimental
   measurements. Benchmarked quantities include the Gruneisen parameter,
   the thermal expansion coefficient, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and
   thermal conductivity. Moreover, the transferability of commonly used
   empirical potential in predicting multiple-target physical properties is
   also examined. Our study suggests that atomic simulation, in conjunction
   with machine learning potential, represents a promising method of
   exploring the various physical properties of novel materials.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical study for a functional design of honeycomb meta-materials
   targeting flexible shear properties (about 6.5MPa effective shear
   modulus and 15\% maximum effective shear strain) is conducted with two
   material selections polycarbonate (PC) and mild-steel (MS), and five
   honeycomb configurations. Cell wall thicknesses are found for each
   material to reach the target shear modulus for available cell heights
   with five honeycomb configurations. PC honeycomb structures can be
   tailored with 0.4 to 1.3mm cell wall thicknesses to attain the 6.5MPa
   shear modulus. MS honeycombs can be built with 0.2mm or lower wall
   thicknesses to reach the target shear modulus. Sensitivity of wall
   thickness on effective properties may be a hurdle to overcome when
   designing metallic honeycombs. The sensitivity appears to be more
   significant with an increased number of unit cells in the vertical
   direction. PC auxetic honeycombs having 0.4 to 1.9 mm cell wall
   thicknesses show 15\% maximum effective shear strain without local cell
   damage. Auxetic honeycombs having negative Poisson's ratio show lower
   effective shear moduli and higher maximum effective shear strains than
   the regular counterparts, implying that auxetic honeycombs are candidate
   geometries for a shear flexure design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper mainly concerns effects of the auxetic structure on the crash

   re-entrant units for the auxetic structure are regularly arranged in the
   tube wall, which are produced by the additive manufacturing with SUS316L
   metal powder. Under the low impact condition, the auxetic does not only
   exhibit higher specific energy absorption, but also demonstrate
   substantially low deceleration due to effect of the densification during
   the axial crash compared with the conventional tube. Furthermore, while
   the honeycomb tube demonstrates oscillating behavior in the
   deceleration, the auxetic tube tends to maintain steady deceleration
   after the first peak during the axial crash, which is able to guarantee
   enhanced damping performances under the low impact condition.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we will investigate the impact of in-plane negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) on the post-buckling responses of
   graphene-reinforced metal matrix composite (GRMMC) laminated plates
   under uni- and bi-axial in-plane compressive loads. The effects of
   temperature variation and foundation support on the post-buckling
   responses of GRMMC laminated plates are also taken into consideration.
   The graphene volume fractions in each layer of a GRMMC plate may vary
   along the plate thickness direction to achieve a functionally graded
   (FG) arrangement. The GRMMC layers have temperature-dependent material
   properties that can be modeled by the extended Halpin-Tsai model.
   Employing the Reddy's third order shear deformation plate theory, the
   governing equations containing both thermal and foundation effects for
   the post-buckling problem of FG-GRMMC plates are formulated. The von
   Karman geometrical nonlinearity is also considered. The post-buckling
   responses of the FG-GRMMC laminated plates are obtained by solving the
   governing equations using a two-step perturbation approach. The results
   have revealed that in-plane NPR has a substantial impact on the
   post-buckling responses of GRMMC laminated plates.}},

Title = {{A biomechanical study of clamping technique on patellar tendon surface
   strain and material properties using digital image correlation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{113}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Several clamping techniques exist for ex vivo mechanical testing of
   tendon. For the patellar tendon, one can choose to clamp directly to the
   bony attachment sites, the tendon itself, or a combination of the two;
   however, the influence of these techniques on localized strains and
   gross material properties is unknown. To this end, uniaxial tensile
   tests were performed on eleven porcine patellar tendons in three
   clamping setups while digital image correlation was used to measure
   axial and transverse strains, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio. The
   setups involved clamping to: 1) the patella and tibia, 2) the patella
   and the dissected distal tendon, and 3) the dissected proximal and
   distal tendon. Axial strains in the tendon-tendon clamping setup were
   181\% higher than patella-tibia clamping (p = 0.002) and 131\% higher
   than patella-tendon clamping (p = 0.006). Transverse strains were not
   significantly different between clamping conditions (p >= 0.118).
   Young's modulus was 50\% (p < 0.001) greater for patella-tibia clamping
   and 42\% (p < 0.001) greater for patella-tendon clamping when compared
   to tendon-tendon clamping. For all clamping setups, the tendon
   illustrated auxetic behaviour (i.e., negative Poisson's ratio); however,
   the Poisson's ratios were 80\% smaller in the patella-tibia setup (p =
   0.006) and 71\% smaller patella-tendon setup (p = 0.007) compared to the
   tendon-tendon setup. These results illustrate that discretion should be
   utilized when reporting material properties derived from mechanical
   tests involving direct clamping to the dissected patellar tendon at both
   ends, as this clamping technique significantly increases axial strains,

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{949-963}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Curved-Layer Manufacturing (CLM) is a method of depositing material
   along the local curvature of the manufactured part, rather than building
   up parts in planar layers like traditional additive manufacturing.
   Lattice-based materials have been shown to have useful structural
   properties and wide-ranging applications, though they are limited to
   patterns along Cartesian axes. Additionally, materials with a negative
   Poisson's ratio, called auxetics, can be created with engineered
   lattices and have wide applications across biomedical, aeronautical, and
   structural fields, though manufacturing is often limited to 2D. This
   provides an opportunity to explore applications of CLM in the
   fabrication of metamaterial lattices such as auxetics outside of
   Cartesian planes. Here, the development of a process for the fabrication
   of non-planar lattice-shells along parametric surfaces is described.
   This method employs Bezier surfaces of arbitrary order, allowing a wide
   variety of parent surfaces. Using this method, a variety of lattices
   were fabricated on Bezier surfaces to demonstrate the propensity of the
   method, while showing it has zero waste material when a reusable mandrel
   is used. Further, a brief experimental exploration demonstrates the
   differences among lattice types, finding that significantly auxetic
   lattice-shells are more resistant to fracture than quadratic and
   disrupted lattices of similar patterns and densities. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Title = {{Higher-order shear deformation of very thick simply supported

Journal = {{MECHANICS BASED DESIGN OF STRUCTURES AND MACHINES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{514-522}},
Abstract = {{Where deflections of thick plates are concerned, sufficient studies have
   been performed on circular and rectangular plates using first-order
   shear deformation theory (FSDT). Less attention, however, has been
   placed on the use of higher-order theories and plates of other shapes.
   This article proposes a deflection model for a simply supported and
   under uniformly loaded equilateral triangular plate that fulfils the
   third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT). Comparison of maximum plate
   deflections using this exact TSDT model with the FSDT and the simplified
   TSDT models reveals that the former exhibits better correlation
   agreement with the exact TSDT. Using the plate deflection from the exact
   TSDT, a refined shear correction factor, which is a function of
   Poisson's ratio, relative thickness, and location on plate, is extracted
   for the FSDT model. Results suggest that the usual shear correction
   model of 5/6 in Mindlin plates is highly accurate when dealing with
   moderately thick triangular plates made from negative Poisson's ratio
   materials, while the prescription of the refined shear correction factor
   obtained herein is advised for very thick triangular plates made from
   large Poisson's ratio materials. The results avail an FSDT deflection
   model for very thick triangular plates with the accuracy of exact TSDT.}},

Title = {{Thickness effect on mechanical behavior of auxetic sintered metal fiber
   sheets}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{167}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{Sintered metal fiber sheets (MFSs) made by sequential-overlap method are
   transversely isotropic open-cell cellular materials with paper-like
   fiber network architectures, which exhibit auxeticity and are promising
   for various potential applications due to the reentrant micro-structure.
   The thickness effect on the out-of-plane auxeticity (negative Poisson's
   ratio) of MFSs samples of 2-20 mm thick subjected to in-plane tensile
   loading is investigated with digital image correlation technique.
   Furthermore, the deformation modes of fibers within MFSs during various
   loading stages are examined with X-ray tomography. It is found that in
   addition to the straightening of reentrant fibers, fiber layers with
   defects and joints failure induced slippage between adjacent layers
   leads to local shear and results in unique umbrella-like local
   deformation termed umbrella effect, which gradually dominates the
   auxeticity during tensile loading. Although remarkably increasing
   lateral deformation, the umbrella effect significantly diminishes the
   in-plane mechanical performance such as rigidity and strength. In
   particular, this effect is suppressed by sample thickness: the overall
   performance tends to stabilize with sample thickness greater than a
   certain value, provided that the MFS is uniform with all fibers randomly
   distributed. The finding facilitates wider application of auxetic MFSs
   with further understanding on the relationship between the thickness
   effect and performance. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Models for the nano/micro-structural deformation and mechanical
   properties of auxetic materials (i.e. materials with a negative
   Poisson's ratio) have been previously developed. However, most of these
   models have been two-dimensional, were usually designed specifically to
   describe some particular class of auxetic materials, and generally only
   described the behaviour of one particular plane whilst completely
   ignoring the out-of-plane behaviour of the material. A three-dimensional
   model has been developed which can be applied to several classes of
   auxetic materials, including microporous expanded polymers such as
   e-PTFE, e-UHMWPE and e-PA, body-centered cubic metals and foams. It is
   generalised that its underlying structure is not specific to a
   lengthscale or material as the previous list shows. The new model offers
   a better insight into the underlying principles behind the observed
   auxetic behaviour and offers a significant improvement in the agreement
   of the models with existing experimental data. It is shown that there
   are geometric limitations to the number of planes that can
   simultanesously display auxetic behaviour. This has ramifications on the
   design of ordered auxetic materials.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, nanocellulose aerogels with a tunable Poisson's ratio
   were fabricated. Tissue engineering scaffolds with a tunable Poisson's
   ratio may be better able to simulate the mechanical behavior of natural
   tissues. A mixture of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and polyethylene
   glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) was used as the raw material to prepare
   CNF/PEGDA aerogels with a multiscale pore structure through a
   combination of stereolithography (SLA) and freeze-drying. The aerogels
   were fabricated with a regular macropore network structure and a random
   and homogeneous distribution of micropores. The macropore structure of
   the scaffolds could be customized through SLA, which resulted in
   scaffolds that exhibited one of three different mechanical behaviors:
   positive Poisson's ratio (PPR), negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) or zero
   Poisson's ratio (ZPR). Then, the hydrogel scaffolds were transformed
   into aerogel scaffolds through the freeze-drying method, which endowed
   the scaffolds with homogeneously distributed micropores. The material
   ratio and exposure were adjusted to obtain scaffolds with a clear pore
   structure. Then, the CNF/PEGDA scaffolds with different Poisson's ratios
   were subjected to mechanical tests, and their chondrogenic induction
   characteristics were determined. The NPR scaffold not only provided a
   good environment for cell growth but also affected mouse bone marrow
   mesenchymal stem cell (mBMSC) proliferation and chondrogenic induction.
   Thus, we provide a feasible scheme for the preparation of
   three-dimensional scaffolds with a multiscale pore structure and tunable
   Poisson's ratio, which contributes to cartilage repair in tissue
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have introduced the auxetic effect in black phosphorus
   (BP) analog Sb and achieved auxetic modulations in monolayer As and Sb
   via first-principles calculations. Compared with monolayer As, the
   monolayer Sb is phonon unstable. By applying uniaxial strain along each
   direction, we discovered zigzag-vertical reversibility on out-of-plane
   auxeticity, and the negative Poisson's ratios for monolayer As and Sb
   were simulated to be -0.125/-0.172 and -0.036/-0.063, respectively, by
   applying the strain along zigzag/vertical directions. The negative
   Poisson's ratio could be significantly manipulated by applying a
   vertical electric field as it can be increased up to 70.3\% for
   monolayer As and decreased up to 55.6\% for monolayer Sb. Such an
   intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio and electric field modulation could
   endow these monolayers with potential applications in auxetic
   optoelectronic devices, electrodes and sensors, leading to novel
   multi-functionalities.}},

Abstract = {{A set of models of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) with alkali cations

   techniques, the objective was to study how the Young's, bulk, and shear
   modulus, as well as the Poisson's ratio changed due to the presence of
   monovalent ions. The effect of density on the elastic moduli was
   neglected, thus the NVT ensemble was used. Comparing the different
   simulation cells, it was found that models with sodium and potassium
   ions in the structure and an alkali/silicon ratio of 0.18 showed
   negative effects on the elastic moduli of C-S-H. This could be mainly
   ascribed to the shielding effect of the alkali on the interlaminar
   interactions that contribute to the cohesion between the layers of
   C-S-H.}},

Abstract = {{Results of examination of experimental data on non-linear elasticity of
   rocks using experimentally determined pressure dependences of P- and
   S-wave velocities from various literature sources are presented.
   Overall, over 90 rock samples are considered. Interpretation of the data
   is performed using an effective-medium description in which cracks are
   considered as compliant defects with explicitly introduced shear and
   normal compliances without specifying a particular crack model with an a
   priori given ratio of the compliances. Comparison with the experimental
   data indicated abundance (similar to 80 \%) of cracks with the
   normal-toshear compliance ratios that significantly exceed the values
   typical of conventionally used crack models (such as penny-shaped cuts
   or thin ellipsoidal cracks). Correspondingly, rocks with such cracks
   demonstrate a strongly decreased Poisson ratio including a significant
   (similar to 45 \%) portion of rocks exhibiting negative Poisson ratios
   at lower pressures, for which the concentration of not yet closed cracks
   is maximal. The obtained results indicate the necessity for further
   development of crack models to account for the revealed numerous
   examples of cracks with strong domination of normal compliance.
   Discovering such a significant number of naturally auxetic rocks is in
   contrast to the conventional viewpoint that occurrence of a negative
   Poisson ratio is an exotic fact that is mostly discussed for artificial
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear compressive response and deformation of an auxetic
   cellular structure that has periodic negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) cell
   were studied through theoretical and numerical method. The in-plane
   deformation and process of absorbing energy of this NPR cellular
   structure were discussed. The relative density of NPR cell was
   determined by geometric parameters and a theoretical approach to the
   strength of NPR cell was carried out to analyze the failure process
   under in-plane compression. Thus, to prove the effective of unit cell
   mechanical model, the size effect of this NPR cellular structure was
   discussed. The simulations of two different NPR cellular structures
   under in-plane compression were generated and their effective
   properties, strain-stress curves, and absorbed energy were analyzed. It
   can be concluded that the NPR cell that has lower relative density may
   have better capability of absorbing energy with enhanced Young's
   modulus. Finally the parametric analyses related to relative density
   were presented with NPR unit cell model and a set of quasistatic
   compressive experiments was carried out, which can be used to reveal the
   nonlinear properties of NPR cellular structure and to prove the
   effectiveness of theoretical method.}},

Abstract = {{Fasteners are used in every industry, and in virtually every component.
   The ideal fastener would be relatively easy to insert or push into a
   hole, but take much more force to remove or pull out of the hole. Such
   fasteners would not require nuts screwed onto bolts, or other retaining
   rings. The current work attempts to develop a simple fastener with a low
   Insertion Force / Removal Force ratio by exploiting auxetic behavior.
   Auxetic materials or negative Poisson's Ratio materials have properties
   that are counter-intuitive. A rubber band, for example, becomes thinner
   in width when pulled lengthwise Auxetic materials, however, will expand
   in width, when pulled along their length, or when compressed along their
   length, will also contract in width. Hence, normal materials have
   positive Poisson's Ratios while auxetic materials are revealed to have
   negative Poisson's Ratio. By exploiting the theory behind negative
   Poisson's Ratios, a suitably designed fastener can exhibit auxetic
   behavior. Specifically, a properly designed fastener will decrease in
   diameter when pushed/compressed through a hole and increase in diameter
   when pulled out of the hole. Using previously developed theory, several
   cylindrical fasteners were fabricated that exhibited auxetic behavior.
   Aluminum sleeves were fabricated with holes of slightly different
   diameters, such that when the fasteners were inserted they must contract
   slightly. Insertion/Removal force ratios as low as 18\% were observed.
   The project is considered a success and could lead to patents and be a
   boon to the fastener industry.
   Based on the research experience a learning module to be implemented in
   an Algebra I class has been designed. The paper describes the learning
   module that is based on an active learning methodology known as Legacy
   Cycle. It will be implemented in the spring semester in Algebra I
   classes in a high school with majority of Hispanic students.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{256}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics) are counter
   intuitive because their mechanical response is unusual. On the other
   hand, instabilities are usually regarded as deleterious phenomena and
   thus their prevention is needed. Here, numerical and theoretical
   evidences have been provided to show that two different elastic
   instabilities are, rather than deleterious, useful phenomena that cause
   auxeticity. It has been shown that a negative Poisson's ratio can be
   found in some face-centered cubic (FCC) single crystals at a finite
   strain as they are under uniaxial stress along the {[}100]-direction.
   The auxeticity is associated with a phase transformation induced by the
   Born-Hill's elastic instability, i.e., an elastic material instability.
   In addition, it has been found that periodic metallic porous structures
   can also show a negative Poisson's ratio at finite compressive strain.
   In this case, buckling of the micro-structure of the porous structures,
   which is an elastic and geometric instability, is respondent for the
   auxeticity.}},

Title = {{Structural phase transition in monolayer gold(I) telluride: From a
   room-temperature topological insulator to an auxetic semiconductor}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{103}},

Abstract = {{Structural phase transitions between semiconductors and topological
   insulators have rich applications in nanoelectronics but are rarely
   found in two-dimensional (2D) materials. In this work, by combining ab
   initio computations and evolutionary structure search, we investigate
   two stable 2D forms of gold(I) telluride (Au2Te) with square symmetry,
   noted as s(I)- and s(II)-Au2Te. s(II)-Au2Te is the global minimum
   structure and is a room-temperature topological insulator. s(I)-Au2Te is
   a direct-gap semiconductor with high carrier mobilities and unusual
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio. Both s(I) and s(II) phases have
   ultralow Young's modulus, implying high flexibility. By applying a small
   tensile strain, s(II)-Au2Te can be transformed into s(I)-Au2Te. Hence, a
   structural phase transition from a room-temperature topological
   insulator to an auxetic semiconductor is found in the 2D forms of Au2Te,
   which enables potential applications in phase-change electronic devices.
   Moreover, we elucidate the mechanism of the phase transition with the
   help of phonon spectra and group theory analysis.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2019}},
Abstract = {{The intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio effect in 2-dimensional
   nanomaterials have attracted a lot of research interests due to its
   superior mechanical properties, and new mechanisms have emerged in the
   nanoscale. In this paper, we designed a novel graphyne-like
   two-dimensional carbon nanostructure with a butterfly shape (GL-2D-1)
   and its configuration isomer with a herring-bone form (GL-2D-2) by means
   of density functional theoretical calculation and predicted their
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio effect and other mechanical
   properties. Both GL-2D-1 and GL-2D-2 present a significant negative
   Poisson's ratio effect under different specific strains conditions. By
   contrast, GL-2D-2 presents a much stronger negative Poisson's ratio
   effect and mechanical stability than does GL-2D-1. It is hoped that this
   work could be a useful structural design strategy for the development of
   the 2D carbon nanostructure with the intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Micromachined polymeric honeycomb membranes having conventional and
   re-entrant cell geometries have been fabricated using femtosecond laser
   ablation. Mechanical properties characterization confirms that the
   re-entrant membrane is auxetic (possesses negative Poisson's ratios:
   nu(xy) = -1.82 +/- 0.05 and nu(yx) = -0.51 +/- 0.01) whereas the
   conventional membrane possesses positive Poisson's ratios (nu(xy) =
   +0.86 +/- 0.06 and nu(yx) = +0.6 +/- 0.1). Comparison with honeycomb
   theory confirms that the dominant deformation mechanism is flexure of
   the honeycomb ribs. The auxetic membrane has been challenged with
   single-sized glass chromatography beads such that the beads were
   initially resting on the re-entrant cells. Subsequent tensile loading of
   the membrane showed the auxetic cells opening during deformation,
   enabling the beads to pass through the membrane. We have modeled the
   pare-opening properties of both types of membranes, and the observed
   behavior for the auxetic membrane is consistent with the model. This is
   a clear proof-of-concept demonstration of the potential of auxetic
   materials and structures in filter defouling or cleaning operations.
   This paper, therefore, demonstrates the successful design and
   fabrication of a micromachined auxetic structure having specifically
   tailored mechanical properties that show enhanced functional performance
   over the conventional filter structure.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber networks with out-of-plane auxetic behavior have been sporadically
   investigated. One of the major challenges is to design such materials
   with giant negative Poisson's ratio over large deformations. Here in, we
   report a systematic investigation to create three-dimensional (3D) fiber
   networks in the form of needlepunched nonwoven materials with
   out-of-plane auxetic behavior over large deformations via theoretical
   modeling and extensive set of experiments. The experimental matrix has
   encapsulated the key parameters of the needlepunching nonwoven process.
   Under uniaxial tensile loading, the anisotropy coupled with local fiber
   densification in networks has yielded large negative Poisson's ratio (up
   to -5.7) specifically in the preferential direction. The in-plane and
   out-of-plane Poisson's ratios of fiber networks have been predicted and,
   subsequently, compared with the experimental results. Fiber orientation
   was found to be a core parameter that modulated the in-plane Poisson's
   ratio of fiber networks. A parametric analysis has revealed the
   interplay between the anisotropy of the fiber network and the
   out-of-plane Poisson's ratio based upon constant volume consideration.}},

Abstract = {{We present a theoretical study of the effective Poisson's ratio of
   elastic solids weakened by porosity and microcracks. Explicit
   expressions of the effective Poisson's ratio are obtained using the
   Mori-Tanaka mean-field approach as applied to macroscopically isotropic
   solids containing randomly distributed and randomly oriented spheroidal
   pores. We focus on the influence of pore shape and concentration and
   devote special attention to the limiting cases of spherical,
   penny-shape, and needle-shape pores. A key result of this study is that
   the effective Poisson's ratio depends only on pore concentration, pore
   shape, and Poisson's ratio of the bulk solid. In other words, it is
   independent of any other elastic constants of the bulk solid. Also, the
   ratio of the shear and bulk moduli behaves similarly. Unlike other
   elastic constants which monotonically decrease with pore concentration,
   Poisson's ratio may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged as a
   function of pore concentration, depending on the pore shape and
   Poisson's ratio of the bulk solid. We discuss ramifications of these
   findings with regard to the elastic constants of oxide superconductors,
   especially the bismuth cuprates, which show unusually low Poisson's
   ratios. We also discuss these low Poisson's ratios, including the
   possibility of negative Poisson's ratios.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{167}},

Abstract = {{Tensegrities consisting of axially loaded strings and bars have various
   technologically important applications. In this paper, we design a
   mechanical metamaterial with tunable and programmable Poisson's ratio on
   the basis of truncated regular octahedral tensegrity (TROT). A
   theoretical model for evaluating the deformation behaviors of TROT is
   established by involving the principle of virtual work. Our experimental
   data obtained from the tests of 3D printed TROT sculptures agree well
   with theoretical predictions. By systemically investigating the
   mechanical properties of the TROT metamaterial, it is found that the
   Poisson's ratio can be programmed to a desired value in a wide
   positive/negative range through the structural prestress, initial twist
   angle, and the stiffnesses of strings/bars. This mechanical metamaterial
   can be utilized not only as elementary cells to assemble other larger
   scale of metamaterials, and also as prototypes with tunable properties
   in designing advanced machineries for applications such as robotics and

Journal = {{GEOFLUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{The time-dependent behaviors of the sedimentary rocks which refer to the
   altering of the mechanical and deformable properties of rock elements in
   the long-term period are of increasing importance in the investigation
   of the failure mechanism of the rock strata in underground coal mines.
   In order to obtain the accurate and reliable mechanical parameters of
   the sedimentary rocks at different weathering grades, the extensive
   experimental programs including the Brazilian splitting test, uniaxial
   compression tests, and direct shear tests have been carried out on the
   specimens that exposed to the nature environments at different
   durations. The correlation between the weathering grades and mechanical
   parameters including uniaxial tensile strength, uniaxial compression
   strength, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, cohesion, and friction
   coefficient was proposed. The obtained results suggested that uniaxial
   tensile strength, uniaxial compressive strength, elastic modulus, and
   cohesion dramatically decreased with increasing weathering time,
   characterized as the negative exponential relationship in general. The
   influences of various weathering grades on fracture behavior of the rock
   specimens were discussed. The cumulative damage of the rock by the
   weathering time decreased the friction coefficient of the specimens
   which led to the initiation and propagation of microcrack within the
   rock at lower stress conditions. The obtained results improved the
   understanding of the roles of weathering on the mechanical properties of
   sedimentary rocks, which is helpful in the design of the underground
   geotechnical structures.}},

Abstract = {{The wave propagation in and the vibration of sandwich plates with
   cellular core are analyzed and controlled. Negative Poisson's ratio
   (auxetic) core materials of different geometry placed periodically in
   the plate introduce the proper impedance mismatch necessary to obstruct
   the propagation of waves over specified frequency bands (stop bands) and
   in particular directions. The location and the extension of the stop
   bands and the directions of wave propagation can be modified by proper
   selection of the periodicity and of the geometrical and physical
   properties of the core.
   A finite element model is developed to predict the dynamic response of
   three-layered sandwich panels with honeycomb core. The finite element
   model along with the theory of periodic structures evaluates the
   influence of core materials of different geometry placed periodically
   along the two dimensions of the structure. This combined analysis yields
   the phase constant surfaces for the considered sandwich plates, which
   define location and extension of the stop bands, as well as the
   directions of wave propagation at assigned frequency values. The
   analysis of the phase constant surfaces and the evaluation of the
   harmonic response at specified frequencies demonstrate the plates'
   directional properties, whose spatial patterns strongly depend on the
   configuration of the periodic core and on the excitation frequency.
   Auxetic honeycombs are here considered as core materials in order to
   obtain maximum design flexibility. Their elastic and inertial
   characteristics in fact vary substantially with their internal geometry.
   For given configurations they outcast up to five times the corresponding
   properties of traditional hexagonal honeycombs.
   The presented numerical results demonstrate the unique characteristics
   of this class of two-dimensional periodic structures, which behave as
   directional mechanical filters. The findings of the study suggest that
   optimal configurations for the periodic cellular core may be identified
   in order to design passive composite panels, which are stable and quiet
   over desired frequency bands and which fit desired transmissibility
   levels in particular directions. Such unique filtering capabilities are
   achieved without requiring additional passive or active control devices
   and therefore without compromising the size and the weight of the
   layered structure.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials (materials with negative Poisson's ratio) and
   nanomaterials have independently been, for many years, two of the most
   active research fields in material science. Recently, these formerly
   independent fields have begun to intersect in new and interesting ways
   due to the recent discovery of auxeticity in nanomaterials like
   graphene, metal nanoplates, black phosphorus, and others. Here, we
   review the research emerging at the intersection of auxeticity and
   nanomaterials. We first survey the atomistic mechanisms, both intrinsic
   and extrinsic, that have been found, primarily through atomistic
   simulations, to cause auxeticity in nanomaterials. We then outline the
   available experimental evidence for auxetic nanomaterials. In order to
   lay the groundwork for future work in this exciting area, we close by
   discussing several future prospects as well as the current challenges in
   this field. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{THE field of supramolecular chemistry has advanced to a stage at which
   it is possible to select building blocks that will self-assemble into
   structures with specific network topologies(1-3). This makes possible
   the rational design and synthesis of molecular solids with potentially
   interesting properties. Here we report the construction of open, hinged
   networks from molecular building blocks, This class of materials has
   been predicted to exhibit unusual mechanical properties, including
   auxetic behaviour (negative Poisson's ratio) and negative coefficients
   of thermal expansion(4-6). Our approach relies on the notion that rigid
   organic molecules of high symmetry will adopt one of only a few possible
   structures when linked via hydrogen bonds or coordination to
   metals(7-9). We use trigonal ligands to make networks joined at the
   vertices by metal ions; the resulting networks are homeotypic(10) with
   the honeycomb-like AIB(2) and the hinge-like ThSi2 phases. The
   hinge-like network has channels of inner diameter 15 Angstrom, within
   which included molecules can be exchanged while the framework remains
   intact, We have not yet determined whether this material is auxetic.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of theoretical calculations, computer simulations, and

   re-entrant honeycomb auxetic structure. Optimal honeycomb cell
   parameters were determined for 3D-printed samples made from

   3D-printed re-entrant honeycomb auxetic samples showed that the
   structure based on auxetic hexagonal cell can withstand almost 1.75
   times more very low cycle fatigue cycles than the similar non-auxetic
   structure. Neither failure nor layer delamination in 3D structures were
   detected in the auxetic sample after 500 compression cycles. 3D-printed
   auxetic structures offer a promising candidate for applications in
   medicine and sports.}},

Abstract = {{Masonry walls allow easy intrusion of the impacting vehicles into the
   impacted buildings. The cause of the damage due to vehicular impacts in
   masonry walls is the generation of tensile stresses due to ``Poisson's
   effect{''}. Auxetic foams, due to their negative Poisson's ratio, can
   eliminate these tensile stresses. In this study, masonry walls with and
   without Auxetic foam renders subject to lateral impact were analysed
   using an explicit finite element method incorporating shell elements.
   Masonry was considered as a homogenised continuum with distinct
   directional properties. The Poisson's ratio of the Auxetic layers was
   considered as -0.2 and -0.9. The impact scenario was simulated using
   applied velocities. The results show that Auxetic layer reduced stresses
   in the masonry wall. The detailed deformation and failure results of the
   numerical examples encourage the potential for developing Auxetic
   composite render material, and methods of design and application to
   masonry walls to mitigate vehicular intrusions.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical procedure has been presented to study the vibrational

Title = {{On the wave propagation properties and Poisson's ratio of the Star-3/6
   structures}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{270}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study, wave propagation characteristics of the Star-3/6
   structures are studied, and the effects of geometric parameters on the
   wave propagation are analyzed. Especially, Poisson's ratio is studied
   based on the long wavelength approximation of band structure. The
   Star-3/6 structures are assembled to be hexagonal and triangular
   topologies with re-entrant angles. By using the finite element method
   and Bloch's theorem, the dynamic models of the Star-3/6 structures are
   established, and the elastic wave behaviors are calculated. The effects
   of geometric parameters on distribution of band gaps are studied in
   detail. By applying the long wavelength approximation of band structure,
   the Poisson's ratio of the macrostructure is predicted, which is also
   obtained by the commercial finite element software for the comparisons.
   This paper confirms that the Star-3/6 structures have a positive
   Poisson's ratio rather than the visual negative Poisson's ratio.
   Additionally, the isotropic features of the Star-3/6 structures are
   evaluated by the group velocity. The Star-3/6 structures show effective
   isotropic features in the low frequency range. As the frequency of
   elastic waves increases, the propagation speed of elastic waves
   decreases, and the wave propagation gradually becomes anisotropic.}},

Title = {{Voltage-dependent modulation of elastic moduli in lattice metamaterials:
   Emergence of a programmable state-transition capability}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{208}},
Pages = {{31-48}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional lattices are ideal candidate for developing artificially
   engineered materials and structures across different length-scales,
   leading to unprecedented multi-functional mechanical properties which
   can not be achieved in naturally occurring materials and systems.
   Characterization of effective elastic properties of these lattices is
   essential for their adoption as structural elements of various devices
   and systems. An enormous amount of research has been conducted on
   different geometry of lattices to identify and characterize various
   parameters which affect the elastic properties. However, till date we
   can not control the elastic properties actively for a lattice
   microstructure, meaning that the elastic properties of such lattices are
   not truly programmable. All the parameters that control the effective
   elastic properties are passive in nature. After manufacturing the
   lattice structure with a certain set of geometric or material-based
   parameters, there is no room to modulate the properties further. In this
   article, we propose a hybrid lattice micro-structure by integrating
   piezo-electric materials with the members of the lattice for active
   voltage-dependent modulation of elastic properties. A bottom-up
   multi-physics based analytical framework leading to closed-form formulae
   is derived for hexagonal lattices to demonstrate the concept of active
   lattices. It is noticed that the Young's moduli are voltage-dependent,
   while the shear modulus and the Poisson's ratios are not functions of
   the applied voltage. Thus, the compound mechanics of deformation induced
   by external mechanical stresses and electric field lead to an active
   control over the Young's moduli as a function of voltage. Interestingly,
   it turns out that a programmable state-transition of the Young's moduli
   from positive to negative values with a wide range can be achieved in
   such hybrid lattices. The physics-based analytical framework for active
   modulation of voltage-dependent elastic properties on the basis of
   operational demands provide the necessary physical insights and
   confidence for potential practical exploitation of the proposed concept
   in various futuristic multifunctional structural systems and devices
   across different length-scales. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{In-plane dynamic crushing behaviors of a novel auxetic honeycomb with
   two plateau stress regions}},

Abstract = {{In order to obtain honeycomb structure with higher energy absorption
   capacity, a novel honeycomb is proposed by adding double arrowhead
   honeycomb (DAH) cells into star-shaped honeycomb (SSH), and therefore
   named as star-arrowhead honeycomb (SAH). An analytical model is built to
   investigate the in-plane elastic properties of the newly proposed
   honeycomb and the results are in good agreement with the finite element
   simulations. The in-plane dynamic crushing behaviors and energy
   absorption capabilities of SAH are studied systematically by finite
   element method and are compared with that of SSH and DAH. Two plateau
   stress regions in the stress-strain curves of SAH are observed under
   low-velocity impact loading, and the second plateau stress is over three
   times higher than the first one. The in-plane Poisson's ratio of SAH
   under static and high-velocity impact loading always shows negative
   value. However, the Poisson's ratio of SAH changes from negative to
   positive under low-velocity and medium-velocity impact loading. In
   addition, the Poisson's ratio of SSH and DAH are negative during the
   entire dynamic deformation processes. The results of finite element
   simulations show that SAH can absorb much more energy than SSH with the
   same relative densities under different impact velocities, especially
   under low-velocity impact loading. Furthermore, the effects of the cell
   wall thickness and the impact velocity on plateau stress of SAH are
   discussed, and therefore a deformation map is summarized. It can be
   concluded that SAH is a better choice for energy absorption. This study
   may provide a new design concept for the high performance honeycomb
   structure with multi plateau stress regions.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic systems have the anomalous property of becoming wider when
   uniaxially stretched, i.e. exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. One of
   the mechanisms which can give rise to this property is based on rotating
   rigid units, in particular 2D rigid polygons which are connected
   together at their corners through hinges and rotate relative to each
   other when uniaxially stretched. This work extends earlier preliminary
   work on connected rigid parallelograms and presents expressions for the
   mechanical properties for all the types of planar systems that can be
   constructed from rigid parallelograms of equal size connected at their
   vartices through flexible hinges. In particular, we drive and discuss
   the mechanical properties for the Type 1 alpha, 1 beta and 1 beta
   rotating parallelograms which were not previously analysed and compare
   them with the properties of the Type II alpha systems. We show that
   despite being rather similar to each other, the different types of
   `rotating parallelograms' have very different mechanical properties and
   different abilities to exhibit auxetic behaviour. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{As a main research object in underground engineering, rock has obvious
   rheological properties due to its material composition and complicated
   geological environment. Applying Burgers constitutive model (which is
   formed with a series of Kelvin model and Maxwell model) to particle flow
   code in three dimensions (PFC3D), this research analyzes the impact of
   different parameters (including elastic coefficients E-m and E-k,
   viscosity coefficients eta(m) and eta(k), and friction factor f) on the
   instantaneous and rheological properties. The controlling variable
   method is used. Conclusions can be drawn as follows. The instantaneous
   strength properties are mainly affected by Maxwell's elastic coefficient
   Em and friction factor f. The elastic modulus and uniaxial compression
   strength have positive correlation with E-m and f. However, Poisson's
   ratio is positively correlated with E-m and negatively correlated with
   f. Meanwhile negative correlations are observed among rheological
   properties and these parameters. Based on these conclusions, a staged
   increment loading creep experiment of red shale is simulated.
   Comparisons with results from laboratory experiments prove the
   feasibility of Burgers constitutive model in PFC3D for creep
   experiments. At the same time, this method is used in staged increment
   cyclic loading and unloading experiment and triaxial creep experiment.
   This research is also a new attempt to analyze creep properties of rock

Title = {{Evolutionary design of nonuniform cellular structures with optimized
   Poisson's ratio distribution}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{384-394}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{For negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) cellular structures, most previous
   research focus on the design of unit cells, and then repeat the unit
   cell to construct uniform cellular structures. However, there is a
   disadvantage that these structures do not have much design freedom to
   achieve high-level functions, such as performing a desired deformation.
   As a solution, an evolutionary design method is proposed to develop
   nonuniform cellular structures. To conduct this method, the design
   domain is divided into finite unit cells with tunable Poisson's ratio
   (PR). With a given objective deformation, the value of each unit cell's
   PR is optimized using evolutionary algorithm (EA). In order to reduce
   the computational cost of the algorithm, discrete cosine transform (DCT)
   is applied to encode the structure for evolving. Considering the
   geometrical complexity of the optimized nonuniform cellular structures,
   additive manufacturing (AM) is chosen to build them physically. Both
   two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) design cases were
   developed and analyzed to validate the proposed method. The
   computational and experimental results showed good conformation with
   each other. Most importantly, this novel design method brings huge
   potential to NPR cellular structures with high-level functions and much
   wider applications. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials, known as materials with negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR), have many promising application areas. However, there are only
   few natural and man-made materials such as certain living bone tissues,
   certain rocks and minerals, polymeric honeycombs, microporous
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), foams, and carbon-fiber-reinforced epoxy
   composite laminate panels that possess this property.
   In recent years, various auxetic material structures have been designed
   and fabricated for diverse applications that utilized normal materials
   which follow Hooke's law but still show the NPR properties. One of the
   applications is body protection pads that are comfortable to wear and
   effective in protecting body parts by reducing impact force and
   preventing injuries in high-risk individuals such as elderly people,
   industry workers, law enforcement and military personnel, and sports
   players. It is important to develop new body protectors that best
   combine each individual's requirements for wearing comfort (flexible,
   light-weight), ease of fitting (customized), ensured protection, and
   cost-effectiveness. The protection pad would be made from multilayer
   materials and adaptive structures to achieve unique multifunctional
   properties such as high hardness, impact toughness, light weight, and
   excellent shock absorption suitable for the needs.
   This paper reports an integrated theoretical, computational (finite
   element analysis), and experimental investigation conducted for typical
   auxetic polymeric materials that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   effect: Parametric 3D CAD models of auxetic polymeric structures such as
   re-entrant hexagonal cells and arrowhead were developed. Then, key
   structural characteristics of protectors were evaluated through static
   analyses of FEA models. In addition, impact/shock analyses were
   conducted through dynamic analyses of FEA models to validate the results
   obtained from the static analyses. Particularly, an advanced additive
   manufacturing (3D printing) technique was used to build prototypes of
   the auxetic polymeric structures. Specifically, three different
   materials typically used for FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) technology
   such as Polylactic acid (PLA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)
   material (NinjaFlex and SemiFlex) were used for different stiffness and
   shock-absorption performances. The 3D printed prototypes were then
   tested and the results were compared with the computational prediction.
   The results showed that the auxetic material can be effective for body
   protection pads. Each structure and material had unique structural
   properties such as stiffness, Poisson's ratio, and efficiency in shock
   absorption. Particularly, auxtetic structures showed better shock
   absorption performance than non-auxetic ones. The mechanism for ideal
   input force distribution or shunting could be suggested for designing
   protectors using various shapes, thicknesses, and materials of auxetic
   materials to reduce the risk of injury.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio cellular materials, with advantages of
   lightweight, excellent damping property and unique auxetic effect
   (becoming wider when stretched and narrower when squashed), have
   tremendous application prospects in the field of vibration reduction.
   The important factors that affect mechanical properties and vibration
   reduction performance of auxetic cellular materials and structures are
   relative density, cell angle and aspect ratio. In this paper, the
   influences of cell angle and thickness on the Poisson's ratio and
   relative density of the foldable (the aspect ratio of the cell is 2)
   thick-wall re-entrant hexagonal auxetic cellular materials are studied
   through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. The variation
   curves of vibration level difference with respect to the Poisson's ratio
   and relative density of cellular materials indicate that vibration
   reduction performance improves with the decrease of cell angle and
   thickness. Furthermore, an empirical formula for calculating vibration
   level difference with the given relative density of auxetic cellular
   materials and structures is presented to guide engineering application.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson regression model has been considered as a standard method for
   modeling count data. However, count data often display overdispersion,
   and thus, negative binomial (NB) regression model has been suggested for
   handling overdispersed count data. In addition, generalized Poisson (GP)
   regression model has been proposed for handling both over-and
   underdispersed count data. This study proposes the score test for
   testing Poisson regression against GP alternatives and proves that it is
   equal to the score test for testing Poisson regression against NB
   alternatives. The advantage of score test over other alternative tests
   such as likelihood ratio and Wald is that the score test can be used to
   determine whether a more complex model is appropriate without fitting
   the more complex model. Application of the proposed score test on the
   Malaysian private car claim count data is illustrated.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in worldwide shortages of
   nasopharyngeal swabs required for sample collection. While the shortages
   are becoming acute due to supply chain disruptions, the demand for
   testing has increased both as a prerequisite to lifting restrictions and
   in preparation for the second wave. One of the potential solutions to
   this crisis is the development of 3D printed nasopharyngeal swabs that
   behave like traditional swabs. However, the opportunity to digitally
   conceive and fabricate swabs allows for design improvements that can
   potentially reduce patient pain and discomfort. The study reports the
   progress that has been made on the development of auxetic nasopharyngeal
   swabs that can shrink under axial resistance. This allows the swab to
   navigate through the nasal cavity with significantly less stress on the
   surrounding tissues. This is achieved through systematically conceived
   negative Poisson's ratio (-upsilon) structures in a biocompatible
   material. Finite element (FE) and surrogate modelling techniques were
   employed to identify the most optimal swab shape that allows for the
   highest negative strain (-epsilon(lat)) under safe stress (-sigma(von)).
   The influence and interaction effects of the geometrical parameters on
   the swab's performance were also characterised. The research
   demonstrates a new viewpoint for the development of functional
   nasopharyngeal swabs that can be 3D printed to reduce patient
   discomfort. The methodology can be further exploited to address various
   challenges in biomedical devices and redistributed manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of the inner surface of an infinitely long
   circular-cylindrical cavity in an isotropic elastic medium is studied in
   the whole range of the Poisson's ratio including negative values
   characteristic of auxetic materials. The existence of the unique
   long-lived propagation mode (true surface wave, TSW) has been confirmed
   on the clean surface with the following properties: (i) existence of a
   low frequency cut-off for all the azimuthal indices n except for n=1
   (flexural mode), (ii) polarization tending to that of the Rayleigh wave
   in the short wavelength limit, (iii) Airy phases (inflection points of
   dispersion curves) for n<6 that shift towards short wave region when the
   Poisson's ratio becomes negative. A number of propagation modes with
   complex frequencies, i.e., with finite life times (surface leaky waves,
   pseudo surface waves) are found. The torsional leaky mode transforms
   into the skimming shear-horizontal wave (Love wave) in the short
   wavelength limit. An axial-radial leaky mode, similar to the Rayleigh
   wave but with reverse elliptical polarization turns out a physical
   solution except for extremely short wavelengths. A strong radial
   component of the longitudinal resonance occurs at wavelengths comparable
   to the cavity's radius especially in the incompressible limit. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper examines the thermal post-buckling behaviors of
   graphene-reinforced metal matrix composite (GRMMC) laminated cylindrical
   panels which possess in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and rest on

   varying graphene volume fractions to obtain functionally graded (FG)
   patterns. Based on the MD simulation results, the GRMMCs exhibit
   in-plane NPR as well as temperature-dependent material properties. The
   governing equations for the thermal post-buckling of panels are based on
   the Reddy's third order shear deformation shell theory. The von Karman

   are also included. The nonlinear partial differential equations for
   GRMMC laminated cylindrical panels are solved by means of a singular

Abstract = {{In this work, we predicted three new two-dimensional (2D) Be2C
   structures, namely, alpha-Be2C, beta-Be2C, and gamma-Be2C, on the basis
   of density functional theory (DFT) computations and the particle-swarm
   optimization (PSO) method. In alpha-Be2C, a carbon atom binds to eight
   Be atoms, forming an octacoordinate carbon moiety. This is the first
   example of an octacoordinate carbon containing material. The other two
   structures, beta-Be2C and gamma-Be2C, are quasi planar hexacoordinate
   carbon (phC) containing 2D materials. Good stability with these three
   phases is revealed by their lower cohesive energy and positive phonon
   modes. More interestingly, these predicted new phases of Be2C are all
   semiconductors and have unusual negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs). If
   synthesized, 2D Be2C materials will have a broad range of applications
   in electronics and mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Laminates that exhibit high and negative Poisson's ratios can be used as
   solid-state actuators, passive and active vibration dampers, and for
   morphing aircraft structures. Recently, fiber-re in forced elastomer
   (FRE) laminates have been fabricated that exhibit extreme (high and
   negative) Poisson's ratios {[}1]. The current research explores twisted
   fiber bundle elastomeric laminates (both single and double helix) which
   are being investigated using experimentation, linear and non-linear
   finite element analysis (FEA). Twisted fiber bundles can be made from
   carbon fibers, fiberglass, etc, but for simplicity the current work uses
   twisted cotton string. It is observed that uniaxial fiber-reinforced
   elastomer laminates, where the fibers are twisted as shown in Figure 1,
   exhibit stress stiffening. Negative Poisson's ratios may be produced if
   the fiber bundles have a double helical path as simulated by a series of
   laminated tubes. Future auxetic FRE laminates may be developed that do
   experience extreme shear.

Abstract = {{The behaviour of the auxetic structure under external load was regarded
   as the behaviour of the compliant (flexible) mechanism. The
   multi-objective topological optimization, based on genetic algorithms
   and the finite element method, was used to find the optimal shape of
   such two-dimensional compliant mechanism in this study. The optimization
   was performed on a quarter of a double-symmetric representative unit
   cell, which is a building block of the symmetrical auxetic structure.
   Static linear computational simulations were performed to determine the
   mechanical response of cell topologies. The proposed method leads to a
   set of best solutions positioned on the Pareto front with different
   topologies and gives a broad overview of possible designs of new auxetic
   structures. The method is highly effective and can be easily extended to
   large deformation formulations, nonlinear elasticity or
   elasto-plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Flat knitting is a widely used fabric manufacturing technology. Compared
   with warp knitting and circular knitting, flat knitting is characterized
   by its higher process flexibility and greater fabric structure variety.
   In this work, flat knitting technology was exploited to fabricate
   auxetic fabrics which laterally expand when stretched. Three kinds of
   geometrical structures, i.e. foldable structure, rotating rectangle and
   reentrant hexagon, were employed as basic reference structures for the
   development of these kinds of auxetic fabrics. The weft knitting
   processes based on these structures were specially developed and auxetic
   fabrics were fabricated using the computerized flat knitting machines.
   The Poisson's ratio-strain curves of the developed fabrics were plotted
   and compared with those calculated using existing models to demonstrate
   the variation trends of Poisson's ratio with the axial strain. The
   results reveal that except the folded fabric formed with the face loops
   and reverse loops in a rectangular arrangement, of which the auxetic
   effect firstly increases and then decreases with the axial strain, the
   auxetic effects of all other fabrics decrease with an increase of the
   axial strain. The work also shows that auxetic fabrics can be realized
   based on knitted structures and that flat knitting technology can
   provide a simple, but highly effective way of fabricating auxetic
   fabrics from conventional yarns.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{1305-1321}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a comparative study on the reliability of auxetic
   (re-entrant honeycomb) and non-auxetic (diamond lattice and conventional
   honeycomb) lattice composites. The analyzed specimen consists of two
   unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced composite (CFRP) face sheets and
   a 3D-printed polymeric core. Low velocity impact tests are conducted
   first to characterize the unit cell deformation pattern, and we further
   explore its influence on core structure behavior as well as sandwich
   panel performance. It is found that the re-entrant topology exhibits
   lower energy absorption capacity but superior robustness and durability.
   Consequently, the re-entrant panel performs best in both force
   mitigation and energy dissipation, provided that the impact energy is
   appropriate. Furthermore, employing re-entrant core not only stabilizes
   the occurrences of the face sheet penetration as the impact energy
   increases, but also grants the sandwich panel consistent behaviors under
   multi-cycle impacts. These unique performances are due to the global
   instability of the auxetic structure, which yields more compliant
   deformation and less stress concentration. Resultant discrepancies shall
   be interpreted with the sandwich core deformation for validation. These
   findings pave the way for developing new class of auxetic lattice
   composites, especially under cyclic loading conditions, through a
   combination of rational design and 3D printing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

   ferroelasticity and bidirectional negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic ferroelasticity and bidirectional
   auxeticity are highly sought for next-generation nanoelectronics,
   spintronics, or mechanical devices, but are rarely reported. Herein,
   using first-principles calculations, we report the coexistence of these
   intriguing properties in the vanadium tetrafluoride (VF4) monolayer. 2D
   VF4 is a direct wide-gap semiconductor with antiferromagnetic order
   stemming from the synergy between the direct exchange and superexchange
   of the d(xy) orbitals in adjacent V atoms. Notably, 2D VF4 features
   ferroelasticity with a moderate reversible strain and low transition
   barrier, enabling manipulation of the in-plane magnetic easy axis via
   external strain. Additionally, 2D VF4 simultaneously harbors an
   ultra-large negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in both the in-plane and
   out-of-plane directions due to the hinged connection between the
   neighboring VF6 octahedra. Our work highlights a new material for the
   exploration of 2D multiferroic physics and the integration of
   antiferromagnetic ferroelasticity and large bidirectional auxeticity
   renders 2D VF4 a versatile candidate for the development of novel
   multifunctional devices.}},

Title = {{Examination of thermal postbuckling of temperature dependent FG-GRMMC
   laminated beams with negative Poisson's ratio on elastic foundations}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect
   on the thermal postbuckling of graphene-reinforced metal matrix
   composite (GRMMC) laminated beams subjected to a uniform temperature
   rise and supported by an elastic foundation. GRMMC layers having
   different graphene volume fractions can facilitate the formation of
   functionally graded (FG) patterns of the beams. The
   temperature-dependent material properties of GRMMC layers can be
   estimated by a nonlinear function of temperature from the results of the
   molecular dynamics simulations. The governing equations for the beam
   thermal postbuckling problem can be derived based on a higher order
   shear deformation beam theory and solved by applying the two-step
   perturbation approach. The von Karman geometric nonlinearity, the
   elastic foundation support and the thermal effect are considered in the
   modeling. Numerical investigations are carried out for
   (10/-10/10/-10/10)S and (10/-10/10)S GRMMC beams with in-plane NPR. The
   results show that the buckling temperature of (10/10/10)S UD beam is
   slightly higher than that of (10/-10/10/-10/10)S UD beam. The thermal
   postbuckling capacity for the (10/-10/10)S FG-X beam becomes much higher
   than that of the (10/-10/10/-10/10)S FG-X beam, when the beam deflection
   is sufficiently large.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the comparative advantage of auxetic membranes over
   non-auxetic ones by geometrical analysis. It is herein demonstrated
   that, unlike non-auxetic sieves, the auxetic sieve exhibits an almost
   linear correlation with the applied strain, thereby demonstrating the
   higher tunability of auxetic sieves. Further investigation on the
   performance of auxetic sieves by varying the initial inclination angle
   shows that the sieving sensitivity is inversely proportional to the
   initial inclination angle. Finally a calculation based on
   (1,4)-reflexyne as a molecular auxetic sieve reveals that such as filter
   can block out impurities of sub-nanoscale size, while enabling the
   transport of biochemicals. The obtained results suggest the use of
   auxetic molecular sieves as high performance bandage, filters and other
   devices that require ultra-clean environment with biochemical
   permeability.}},

Volume = {{118}},

Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, also known as auxetics, have
   attracted a lot attention as they have shown innovation potential in
   applications for energy damping, modern fasteners, biomedical implants,
   piezoelectric sensors, and soft actuators. In this study, we introduce
   different patterns of graded distribution of unit cells with positive
   and negative Poisson's ratio in tubular configurations. Seven types of
   patterns are programmed into the fabric of the metamaterial to create
   desired shape changes upon applying far-field external loads. Two of the
   patterns demonstrate near-zero Poisson's ratio even at axial strains as
   high as 44\%. Other pattern distributions convert the initially
   cylindrical shape of the tubes to vase, barrel, hourglass,
   nonsymmetrical vase, and nonsymmetrical hourglass geometries. The
   experimental Poisson's ratio values for the linear
   negative-to-positive-to-negative gradient (resulting in hourglass shape)
   and linear positive-to-negative-to-positive gradient (resulting in
   barrel shape) cases are +0.53 and -0.47, respectively. The measured
   Poisson's ratio values at tube level are in good accordance with the
   analytical values of +0.5 and -0.5. Benefits of the proposed designs in
   applications such as action-at-a-distance actuators and wrinkle-free
   jointless hinges in both 3D and 2D configurations are demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Professor Lakes created foams with negative Poisson's ratio:; in 1987.
   Since then he has examined interesting and fantastic characteristics of
   such foams and proposed their realistic and future possible
   applications. The present study was motivated by our interest in how
   such a foam behaves for a sudden loading if it is saturated with fluid.
   To highlight mechanical interactions between elastic deformation of such
   a foam and diffusion of the saturating fluid, we solved four problems in
   a unified manner: 2D and 3D, Cryer and Mandel problems. It is found that
   for all these problems the pore fluid pressure near the sample center
   climbs up from its initial pressure and then declines and vanishes; its
   peak is much higher for negative Poisson's ratios, that is, much more
   remarkable Mandel-Cryer effect. Stress components such as tangential
   stress also show similar behavior, and the tangential stress has tension
   near the sample surface in spite of compressive loading. It is also
   found that for the step-like axial compression the Mandel cylinder
   sample laterally expands immediately after the loading, then shrinks and
   finally becomes thinner than its original thickness; a possible
   application is proposed.}},

Title = {{Analyzing hospitalization data: potential limitations of Poisson
   regression}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background. Poisson regression is commonly used to analyze
   hospitalization data when outcomes are expressed as counts (e.g. number
   of days in hospital). However, data often violate the assumptions on
   which Poisson regression is based. More appropriate extensions of this
   model, while available, are rarely used.
   Methods. We compared hospitalization data between 206 patients treated
   with hemodialysis (HD) and 107 treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD)
   using Poisson regression and compared results from standard Poisson
   regression with those obtained using three other approaches for modeling
   count data: negative binomial (NB) regression, zero-inflated Poisson
   (ZIP) regression and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression.
   We examined the appropriateness of each model and compared the results
   obtained with each approach.
   Results. During a mean 1.9 years of follow-up, 183 of 313 patients
   (58\%) were never hospitalized (indicating an excess of `zeros'). The
   data also displayed overdispersion (variance greater than mean),
   violating another assumption of the Poisson model. Using four criteria,
   we determined that the NB and ZINB models performed best. According to
   these two models, patients treated with HD experienced similar
   hospitalization rates as those receiving PD \{NB rate ratio (RR): 1.04
   {[}bootstrapped 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.49-2.20]; ZINB summary
   RR: 1.21 (bootstrapped 95\% CI 0.60-2.46)\}. Poisson and ZIP models fit
   the data poorly and had much larger point estimates than the NB and ZINB
   models {[}Poisson RR: 1.93 (bootstrapped 95\% CI 0.88-4.23); ZIP summary
   RR: 1.84 (bootstrapped 95\% CI 0.88-3.84)].
   Conclusions. We found substantially different results when modeling
   hospitalization data, depending on the approach used. Our results argue
   strongly for a sound model selection process and improved reporting
   around statistical methods used for modeling count data.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of flexible and stretchable sensors relies on the
   optimization of both the flexible substrate and the sensing element, and
   their synergistic interactions. Herein, a novel strategy is reported for
   cost-effective and scalable manufacturing of a new class of porous
   materials as 3D flexible and stretchable piezoresistive sensors, by
   assembling carbon nanotubes onto porous substrates of tunable Poisson
   ratios. It is shown that the piezoresistive sensitivity of the sensors
   increases as the substrate's Poisson's ratio decreases. Substrates with
   negative Poisson ratios (auxetic foams) exhibit significantly higher
   piezoresistive sensitivity, resulting from the coherent mode of
   deformation of the auxetic foam and enhanced changes of tunneling
   resistance of the carbon nanotube networks. Compared with conventional
   foam sensors, the auxetic foam sensor (AFS) with a Poisson's ratio of
   -0.5 demonstrates a 300\% improvement in piezoresistive sensitivity and
   the gauge factor increases as much as 500\%. The AFS has high sensing
   capability, is extremely robust, and capable of multimodal sensing, such
   as large deformation sensing, pressure sensing, shear/torsion sensing,
   and underwater sensing. AFS shows great potential for a broad range of
   wearable and portable devices applications, which are described by
   reporting on a series of demonstrations.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the complexity that can exist in the modelling of auxetic
   lattices. By introducing pin-jointed members and large deformations to
   the analysis of a re-entrant structure, we create a material which has
   both auxetic and non-auxetic phases. Such lattices exhibit complex
   equilibrium behaviour during the highly nonlinear transition between
   these two states. The local response is seen to switch many times
   between stable and unstable states, exhibiting both positive and
   negative stiffnesses. However, there is shown to exist an underlying
   emergent modulus over the transitional phase, to describe the average
   axial stiffness of a system comprising a large number of cells.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the traffic accident at the S-ramps of trumpet
   interchanges. The purposes of the study are to analyze the relations
   between the driving conditions of ramps and traffic accidents, and to
   develop the accident models. In pursuing the above, 142 trumpet
   interchange (AO, AU, BO and BU) are classified into 4 types; the
   characteristic data of ramp alignments are investigated; the expressway
   traffic accident records (the 720 case of traffic accidents from
   September 1, 1998. to December 31, 2003) are collected; and the data of
   expressway traffic volume are calculated (the average annual daily
   traffic of each ramp is calibrated by the expressway origin destination
   survey). In this study, the accident models, using by Poisson, Negative
   Binomial (NB) and Zero-Altered Model (ZAM) which are all statistically
   significant were developed. The likelihood ratio of Poisson model is
   0.1212 and that of Zero Inflated Poisson (ZIP) model is 0.2020. Also,
   the analysis shows that the likelihood ratio of Negative binominal
   regression model is 0.1918 and that of Zero Inflated Negative Binomial
   (ZINB) model is 0.1993. In summary, it is analyzed that NB model is the
   greatest among the above 4 models on the trumpet interchange S-type

Abstract = {{Expanded Polystyrene Styrofoam (EPS) geofoam is widely used in various
   civil engineering applications. To predict the responses of structures
   to external loading, when in the presence of geofoam, understanding
   physical and mechanical behavior of geofoam, both short and long term,
   is very essential. A series of laboratory experiments was conducted on
   EPS15, EPS20, and EPS25 geofoam specimens under different loading
   conditions. To understand the short-term behavior, static uniaxial
   compression and cyclic uniaxial compression (CUC) tests were performed;
   however, for long-term behavior, accelerated creep and pseudo long-term
   tests were conducted on geofoam samples. CUC tests were performed at
   different static and cyclic stress amplitudes and loading frequencies
   for 5,000 load cycles, and the results reveal that, irrespective of
   geofoam density, secant modulus (E-dyn) decreases and the damping ratio
   of geofoam increases with the increase in cyclic axial strain. Also, it
   was observed that an increase in cyclic axial strain and the number of
   loading cycles reduced the Poisson's ratio of geofoam from positive to
   negative values. From the time-temperature-stress superposition
   accelerated creep testing method, creep strains developed in EPS15,
   EPS20, and EPS25 geofoam samples at the end of 100 years were 2.12, 2.4,
   and 2.11 \%, respectively. From pseudo long-term tests, the estimated
   Young's modulus (E) of geofoam decreases with the increase in
   compressive creep strain for all three densities of geofoam.}},

Journal = {{AIP ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This letter presents a piezoelectric bimorph with auxetic (negative
   Poisson's ratio) behaviors for increased power output in vibration
   energy harvesting. The piezoelectric bimorph comprises a 2D auxetic
   substrate sandwiched between two piezoelectric layers. The auxetic
   substrate is capable of introducing auxetic behaviors and thus
   increasing the transverse stress in the piezoelectric layers when the
   bimorph is subjected to a longitudinal stretching load. As a result,
   both 31- and 32-modes are simultaneously exploited to generate electric
   power, leading to an increased power output. The increasing power output
   principle was theoretically analyzed and verified by finite element (FE)
   modelling. The FE modelling results showed that the auxetic substrate
   can increase the transverse stress of a bimorph by 16.7 times. The
   average power generated by the auxetic bimorph is 2.76 times of that
   generated by a conventional bimorph. (C) 2017 Author(s).}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{An auxetic tow or fiber bundle that will expand in diameter when
   extended axially would be very useful. It could be woven into a
   shape-changing cloth, perhaps used for ballistic protection, or as an
   easily cleaned filter. To explore this concept, spiral fiber bundle
   structures under tension were explored. Theory describing the geometry
   of spiral structures was developed. Several types of finite element
   models for these spiral structures using laminated plate elements, beam
   elements and solid elements with contact were then developed and
   compared at a range of angles. The beam and solid element models provide
   the best approximation and indicate that a 30 degrees/45 degrees fiber
   structure is a good angle combination to not only provide significant
   radial expansion but also show a relatively low stress. Several
   polymeric specimens were 3D-printed and tested under tension. Testing
   confirmed that the spiral fiber systems exhibited auxetic behavior. The
   polymeric specimens exhibited more radial expansion than the finite
   element predictions. Thus, spiral fiber bundles show promise and will be
   explored further.}},

   two-dimensional emergent fermions}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) emergent fermions and negative Poisson's ratio in
   2D materials are fascinating subjects of research. Here, based on
   first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we predict that
   the hexacoordinated Mg2C monolayer hosts both exotic properties. We
   analyze its phonon spectrum, reveal the Raman-active modes, and show
   that it has small in-plane stiffness constants. Particularly, under the
   tensile strain in the zigzag direction, the Mg2C monolayer shows an
   intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio similar to - 0.023, stemming from its
   unique puckered hinge structure. The material is metallic at its
   equilibrium state. A moderate biaxial strain can induce a
   metal-semimetal-semiconductor phase transition, during which several
   types of 2D unconventional fermions emerge, including the anisotropic
   Dirac fermions around 12 tilted Dirac points in the metallic phase, the
   2D double Weyl fermions in the semimetal phase where the conduction and
   valence bands touch quadratically at a single Fermi point, and the 2D
   pseudospin-1 fermions at the critical point of the
   semimetal-semiconductor phase transition where three bands cross at a
   single point on the Fermi level. In addition, uniaxial strains along the
   high-symmetry directions break the threefold rotational symmetry and
   reduce the number of Dirac points. Interestingly, it also generates 2D
   type-II Dirac points. We construct effective models to characterize the
   properties of these fermions. Our result reveals Mg2C monolayer as an
   intriguing platform for the study of 2D unconventional fermions, and
   also suggests its great potential for nanoscale device applications.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional diborides MB2, featured in stacking the M layer above
   the middle of the honeycomb boron layer, have been extensively studied.
   However, little a) available. Here, by means of evolutionary algorithm
   and first-principles calculations, we extensively studied the monolayer
   MB2 crystal with M elements ranging from group IIA to IVA covering 34
   candidates. Our computations screened out eight stable monolayers MB2 (M
   = Be, Mg, Fe, Ti, Hf, V, Nb, Ta), and they exhibit Dirac-like band
   structures. Dramatically, among them, groups IVB-VB transition-metal
   diboride MB2 (M = Ti, Hf, V, Nb, Ta) are predicted to be a new class of
   auxetic materials. They harbor in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   arising mainly from the orbital hybridization between M d and Boron p
   orbitals, which is distinct from previously reported auxetic materials.
   The unusual NPR and the Dirac transport channel of these materials are
   applicable to nanoelectronics and nanomechanics.}},

Title = {{A flexible porous chiral auxetic tracheal stent with ciliated epithelium}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{153-165}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Tracheal stent placement is a principal treatment for tracheobronchial
   stenosis, but complications such as mucus plugging, secondary stenosis,
   migration, and strong foreign body sensation remain unavoid-able
   challenges. In this study, we designed a flexible porous chiral tracheal
   stent intended to reduce or overcome these complications. The stent was
   innovatively designed with a flexible tetrachiral and anti-tetrachiral
   hybrid structure as the frame and hollows filled with porous silicone
   sponge. Detailed finite element analysis (FEA) showed that the designed
   frame can maintain a Poisson's ratio that is negative or close to zero
   at up to 50\% tensile strain. This contributes to improved airway
   ventilation and better resis-tance to migration during physiological
   activities such as respiration and neck movement. The preparation
   process combined indirect 3D printing with gas foaming and particulate
   leaching methods to efficiently fabricate the stent. The stent was then
   subjected to uniaxial tension and local radial compression tests, which
   indicated that it not only has the same desirable auxetic performance
   but also has flexibility sim-ilar to the native trachea. The porous
   sponge facilitated the adhesion of cells, allowed nutrient diffusion,
   and would prevent the ingrowth of granulation tissue. Furthermore, a
   ciliated tracheal epithelium similar to that of the native trachea was
   differentiated from normal human bronchial primary epithelial cells on
   the internal wall of the stent under air-liquid interface conditions.
   These results suggest that the designed stent has the potential for
   application in the treatment of tracheobronchial stenosis.
   Statement of significance
   In this study, a new flexible porous chiral auxetic tracheal stent with
   ciliated epithelium was developed. Its auxetic properties provide a
   larger ventilation cross-sectional area and greater anti-migration
   force. It is also compatible with the tracheal growth of pediatric
   patients. It is flexible enough to reduce foreign body sensation and can
   be compressed for stent delivery. The stent can be optimized for each
   patient using indirect 3D printing. The porous sponge filler prevents
   granulation tissue ingrowth and provides a suitable environment for
   epithelial cells. The ciliated epithelium on the inner wall of the stent
   is expected to have a clearing function similar to the native trachea.
   This flexible auxetic tracheal stent provides new opportunities and
   insights into the treatment of tracheobronchial stenosis.

Abstract = {{In this letter, we developed a piezoresistive auxetic sensor structure
   based on a silicone elastomer and carbon-based conductive thermoplastic
   elastomer fiber sensor (CTPE fiber). Liquid silicone has been used as
   the matrix material. In addition silicone has been mixed with silica
   filler to tailor the stiffness of an auxetic elastic structure that
   improved the sensor behavior of silicone-based CTPE fiber composites.
   The 2D auxetic structures with and without silica fillers have been
   successfully printed with the direct ink writing method. The
   piezoresistive fiber was integrated and the auxetic structure were
   embedded in the silicone matrix in a second step, via casting method. To
   detect the electrical signal behavior of the integrated fiber sensor,
   the hybrid manufactured auxetic fiber sensor composite was investigated
   using dynamic cycle testing between 0 and 20\% strain. Using silicone
   with silica filler for the printing of the auxetic structure, the sensor
   behavior of the piezoresistive fiber elastomer composite was improved
   and a secondary peak of the sensor signal could be avoided at low
   strains. Unfortunately, a constant gauge factor between 0 and 20\%
   strain could not be obtained by implementing the auxetic structure
   element inside the CTPE fiber composite. However, this structure can
   already be integrated into a watchband and used for gesture-controlled
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a level set-based robust topology optimization (RTO)
   method for computational design of metamaterials under hybrid
   uncertainties, e.g. auxetics with negative Poisson's ratio, where the
   Young's modulus of the solid is described as a random variable while the
   Poisson's ratio is regarded as an interval variable. Firstly, the robust
   objective function is formulated by a combination of interval mean and
   interval variance of the deterministic objective function. Secondly, the
   interval mean and interval variance are computed by a hybrid uncertain
   analysis approach, termed as Polynomial Chaos-Chebyshev Interval (PCCI)
   method. Thirdly, the design sensitivities of the robust objective
   function are obtained after the implementation of the PCCI method.
   Finally, a powerful parametric level set method (PLSM) in conjunction
   with the numerical homogenization method is applied to achieve the
   robust topological design for the auxetic microstructure. Several
   numerical cases are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed method for the robust topology optimization problems. This
   method is non-intrusive and general, and can be easily extended to a
   range of design problems of micro-structured metamaterials. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Nanoporous gold (np-Au) exhibits variations in the value of the plastic
   Poisson's ratio, nu(p) - ranging from negative to positive - often for
   similar relative densities and ligament diameters. We investigate the
   effect of pre-existing lattice defects on nu(p) of np-Au using molecular
   dynamics simulations. Uniaxial compression of np-Au samples that have
   the same porous morphology, but distinct defect densities, shows that a
   high density of pre-existing defects reduces nu(p). We interpret this
   observation by linking nanoscale tension-compression asymmetry in
   individual ligaments to the synergistic interplay between defects and
   surfaces, and ultimately to the plastic transverse coupling in np-Au.

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new concept to enhance the efficiency of the
   vibration energy harvesting via an intermediate booster. The boosters
   have auxetic structures and exert extra stretching strain in two
   perpendicular directions. The concept is tested on a conventional
   cantilever beam under the base excitation. The problem consists of a
   cantilever beam subjected to a body load at low frequencies. An auxetic
   substrate is bonded to the beam with a thin epoxy layer, and the
   piezoelectric (PZT) element is attached on top of it. Two different
   auxetic structures are investigated in this study. It is shown that
   employing these kinds of boosters can remarkably enhance the performance
   of the energy harvesting system. The harvesting efficiency is
   numerically evaluated in different load amplitudes and frequencies. A
   parametric study is then carried out, and effects of different
   geometrical design parameters of the auxetic boosters on the performance
   of the energy harvesting system are investigated. Comparing with the
   case in which the PZT is straightly attached to the cantilever, it is
   shown that adding such intermediate boosters at low -frequency range can
   increase the extracted power by factors of 3.9 and 7.0 for the two
   proposed geometries.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of cellular materials depend as much on their
   architecture as on their composition. Auxetic materials are a novel
   class of mechanical metamaterials which exhibit an interesting property
   of negative Poisson's ratio by virtue of their architecture rather than
   composition. One of their most interesting aspects is their improved
   indentation resistance, impact resistance and fracture toughness. Thus,
   they have potential applications in wearable impact protection. The
   classical re-entrant structure has been a focus of research for many
   years because of its well established auxetic behaviour. However, the
   stiff re-entrant corners, buckling of struts, less strain sensitivity
   and limited cellular stiffness limit its applications in wearable impact
   protection devices. In this work, multi-material cellular designs are
   proposed which have the capability to fulfill the requirements for
   wearable impact protection devices. With the advancements in 3D
   printing, multi-material cellular designs can be realized in practice.
   Using Finite Elements approach, two-material and multi material cellular
   designs are investigated. It was observed that introduction of material
   gradient/distribution in the cell provides a means to tailor auxetic
   behaviour, cellular stiffness and strain-sensitivity as per the specific
   requirement. The results will lead to a better understanding of
   tailoring auxeticity in cellular materials and will aid in the design of
   auxetic wearable impact protection devices which rely on auxeticity
   gradients and variable auxeticity as well.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we use computer simulations (Molecular Dynamics) to
   analyse the behaviour of a specific auxetic hierarchical mechanical
   metamaterial composed of square-like elements. We show that, depending
   on the design of hinges connecting structural elements, the system can
   exhibit a controllable behaviour where different hierarchical levels can
   deform to the desired extent. We also show that the use of different
   hinges within the same structure can enhance the control over its
   deformation and mechanical properties, whose results can be applied to
   other mechanical metamaterials. In addition, we analyse the effect of
   the size of the system as well as the variation in the stiffness of its
   hinges on the range of the exhibited auxetic behaviour (negative
   Poisson's ratio). Finally, it is discussed that the concept presented in
   this work can be used amongst others in the design of highly efficient
   protective devices capable of adjusting their response to a specific

   well as rectangular cross sections of various aspect ratios. Emphasis is
   given to the loci of conventional, moderately auxetic and highly auxetic

   biaxial order. Our study relies on understanding order parameters (OPs),
   determined via Raman scattering, for LCEs strained either parallel or
   perpendicular to the director and explaining their relevance in terms of
   existing LCE theory. In particular, we consider a 3D interpretation of
   the orientational distribution function. We use uniaxial and biaxial
   models to deduce that (i) a changing nematic order drives the mechanical
   Freedericksz transition (MFT), (ii) the apparent semi-soft elasticity
   exhibited by this LCE is related to this change in order, (iii) there is
   also an emergence of biaxial order in the LCE, and (iv) the emergence of
   biaxiality explains the auxetic response. Uniaxial OPs, < P-200 > and <
   P-400 >, initially take values of 0.6 and 0.3 and, for strains parallel
   to the director, increase by 20\%. For perpendicular strains, the OPs
   reduce dramatically with increasing strain, becoming zero at the MFT,
   where the director reorients to align with the strain axis; the auxetic
   behavior emerges in the same strain regime. Our explanation identifies
   key parameters in determining the requirements for auxetic behavior in
   LCEs.}},

Abstract = {{Knitted auxetic fabrics (AF) are in common practice but their stability
   and thickness are major problems in commercial applications. Therefore,
   a simple method of developing woven AF is proposed here. Differential
   shrinking property of different weaves is utilized to visualize auxetic
   honey comb geometry in fabric structure. Based on this fabric structure,
   auxeticity is induced in 2-D-woven fabric. AF is developed using
   conventional nonauxetic materials (i.e., cotton in warp and elastane
   {[}Lycra] yarn in the weft). Auxetic nature and auxetic structure in the
   fabric were characterized by microscope. Comfort properties (air
   permeability, thermal resistance, stiffness, and wicking) of AF were
   compared with conventional nonauxetic fabrics (NAF). Piezoresistive
   nature of conductive AF and NAF is also compared. AF showed superior
   comfort properties and higher sensitivity as compared to conventional
   NAF. Based on results, AF can be considered better replacement of
   conventional NAF in wearable and medical applications.}},

Title = {{The influence of large deformations on mechanical properties of
   sinusoidal ligament structures}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Studies of mechanical properties of materials, both theoretical and
   experimental, usually deal with linear characteristics assuming a small
   range of deformations. In particular, not much research has been
   published devoted to large deformations of auxetic structures - i.e.
   structures exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio. This paper is focused on
   mechanical properties of selected structures that are subject to large
   deformations. Four examples of structure built of sinusoidal ligaments
   are studied and for each geometry the impact of deformation size and
   geometrical parameters on the effective mechanical properties of these
   structures are investigated. It is shown that some of them are auxetic
   when compressed and non-auxetic when stretched. Geometrical parameters
   describing sinusoidal shape of ligaments strongly affect effective
   mechanical properties of the structure. In some cases of deformation,
   the increase of the value of amplitude of the sinusoidal shape decreases
   the effective Poisson's ratio by 0.7. Therefore the influence of
   geometry, as well as the arrangement of ligaments allows for smart
   control of mechanical properties of the sinusoidal ligament structure
   being considered. Given the large deformation of the structure, both a
   linear elastic material model, and a hyperelastic Neo-Hookean material
   model are used.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel two-dimensional SnS allotrope (monolayer delta-SnS)
   based on an auxetic delta-phosphorene configuration using
   first-principles calculations. This monolayer appears to have
   outstanding stability as revealed by its energetic, kinetic,
   thermodynamic, and mechanic calculations, and it can withstand
   temperatures as high as 900 K. Monolayer delta-SnS is a wide
   direct-bandgap (2.354 eV) semiconductor, and its electron mobility is as
   high as similar to 1.25 x 10(3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), higher than that of
   monolayer KTlO (similar to 450 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) and MoS2 (similar to 200
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1)). Optical absorption spectra, reaching up to the order
   of similar to 10(5) cm(-1), are obviously excellent in the visible-light
   region, suggesting efficient harvesting of solar radiation. Because of
   its unique atomic motif, monolayer delta-SnS presents an unusual
   bidirectional auxetic effect: a high negative in-plane Poisson's ratio
   (-0.048 and -0.068), which is larger than those for many recently
   reported two-dimensional auxetic materials, e.g., black phosphorene
   (-0.027), borophene (-0.04), and monolayer penta-B2N4 (-0.02). The
   bandgap and band edge can be substantially manipulated under strain to
   meet the requirement of the water-splitting reaction. Particularly, when
   pH = 7, suitable band-edge alignments and small overpotentials of the
   photocatalytic OER (oxygen evolution reaction) and HER (hydrogen
   evolution reaction) appear, endowing monolayer delta-SnS with great
   potential as an efficient visible-light-driven bifunctional
   photocatalyst for water splitting.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{286-295}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are a class of materials that expand transversely when
   stretched longitudinally. Recently, auxetic materials are gaining
   special interest in the technical sectors mainly due to their attractive
   mechanical behavior. This paper reports, for the first time, the
   development of auxetic structures from composite materials and the
   characterization of their auxetic as well as mechanical properties. Five
   different auxetic structures were developed varying their structural
   angle using core reinforced braided composite rods, containing glass
   fibers for axial reinforcement, polyester filaments for braided
   structure and epoxy resin as the matrix. Auxetic behavior of these
   structures was studied in a tensile testing machine using an image-based
   tracking method. Additionally, an analytical model was used to calculate
   Poisson's ratio of these structures. According to experimental and
   analytical results, auxetic behavior and tensile characteristics of
   these structures were strongly dependant on their initial geometric
   configuration (i.e. structural angle). These novel auxetic structures
   exhibited Poisson's ratio in the range of -0.30 to -5.20. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A 2D (two-dimensional) random cellular solid model was built using FEM
   (finite element method) based on a modified Voronoi tessellation
   technique. A sequence of permanent biaxial compression deformations was
   applied on the model to obtain a series of re-entrant random cellular
   solid structures with different area compression ratios. The Poisson's
   ratio and energy absorption capacity of cellular solid models with
   different initial relative densities (0.032 and 0.039) were studied at
   different area compression ratios. The results showed that the Poisson's
   ratio first decreased and then increased with increasing compression
   strain. A minimum Poisson's ratio of approximately -0.38 was achieved
   with an appropriate compression strain. An empirical fitting rule was
   established which can best fit the 2D simulation to 3D experimental
   results for foams. The cellular solids with minimum negative Poisson's
   ratio can exhibit the highest energy absorption capacity. Furthermore,
   mechanical properties of the random cellular solid model were compared
   with 2D regular honeycomb models with both concave- and convex-shaped
   cells. Results showed that the energy absorption capacity of the three
   models increased with an increasing dynamic compression velocity. The
   random foam model exhibited the highest increase rate in energy
   absorption capacity with the increasing compression velocity.}},

Abstract = {{The wave propagation in and the vibration of sandwich plates with
   cellular core are analyzed and controlled. Negative Poisson's ratio
   (auxetic) core materials of different geometry placed periodically in
   the plate introduce the proper impedance mismatch necessary to obstruct
   the propagation of waves over specified frequency bands (stop bands) and
   in particular directions. The location and the extension of the stop
   bands and the directions of wave propagation can be modified by proper
   selection of the periodicity and of the geometrical and physical
   properties of the core.
   A Finite Element model is developed to predict the dynamic response of
   three-layered sandwich panels with honeycomb core. The Finite Element
   model along with the theory of periodic structures is used to evaluate
   the influence of core materials of different geometry placed
   periodically along the two dimensions of the structure. This combined
   analysis yields the phase constant surfaces for the considered sandwich
   plates, which define location and extension of the stop bands, as well
   as the directions of wave propagation at assigned frequency values. The
   analysis of the phase constant surfaces and the evaluation of the
   harmonic response at specified frequencies indicate that the plates are
   characterized by dynamic behaviors with directional properties, with
   spatial patterns strongly dependent on the configuration of the periodic
   core and on the excitation frequency. Auxetic honeycombs are considered
   as core materials in order to obtain maximum design flexibility. The
   elastic and inertial characteristics of auxetic honeycombs in fact vary
   substantially with their internal geometry and for given configurations
   outcast up to five times the corresponding properties of traditional
   hexagonal honeycombs.
   The presented numerical results demonstrate the unique characteristics
   of this class of two-dimensional periodic structures, which behave as
   directional mechanical filters. The findings of this study suggest that
   optimal configurations for the periodic cellular core can be identified
   in order to design passive composite panels, which are stable and quiet
   over desired frequency bands and which fit desired transmissibility
   levels in particular directions. Such unique filtering capabilities are
   achieved without requiring additional passive or active control devices
   and therefore without compromising the size and the weight of the
   layered structure.}},

Journal = {{BIORESOURCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{8823-8838}},
Abstract = {{Lattice truss cores are used to reduce the mass and increase the
   strength of sandwich boards. These panels are typically manufactured
   from metal or carbon composites. As a rule, they do not exhibit auxetic
   properties. Auxetic structures have several extraordinary mechanical
   properties. The aim of this study was to manufacture lattice auxetic
   cores from a biodegradable material and determine their elastic
   properties. The structures were produced from LayWood Olive, a composite
   containing polylactic acid and 40\% wood dust. The cores had comparable
   relative densities, but their geometry and number of cells differed. As
   a result of uniaxial compression in individual lattice truss cores, it
   was shown that the cores whose cells were square in the top view were
   isotropic. In contrast, cores with rectangular cells were strongly
   orthotropic. Moreover, the Poisson's ratio changed depending on the cell
   size and rib angle. Among the cores that exhibited isotropic properties,
   the lowest Poisson's ratio and modulus of elasticity were recorded for
   the structure composed of 49 cells with ribs that were 2 mm thick. The
   highest Poisson's ratio and modulus of linear elasticity were found with
   the orthotropic structure composed of 15 cells with ribs that were 3 mm
   thick. This paper was based on numerical calculations that were verified
   by experimental studies.}},

Title = {{Testing approaches for overdispersion in Poisson regression versus the
   generalized Poisson model}},
Journal = {{BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{565-584}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Overdispersion is a common phenomenon in Poisson modeling, and the
   negative binomial (NB) model is frequently used to account for
   overdispersion. Testing approaches (Wald test, likelihood ratio test
   (LRT), and score test) for overdispersion in the Poisson regression
   versus the NB model are available. Because the generalized Poisson (GP)
   model is similar to the NB model, we consider the former as an alternate
   model for overdispersed count data. The score test has an advantage over
   the LRT and the Wald test in that the score test only requires that the
   parameter of interest be estimated under the null hypothesis. This paper
   proposes a score test for overdispersion based on the GP model and
   compares the power of the test with the LRT and Wald tests. A simulation
   study indicates the score test based on asymptotic standard Normal
   distribution is more appropriate in practical application for higher
   empirical power, however, it underestimates the nominal significance
   level, especially in small sample situations, and examples illustrate
   the results of comparing the candidate tests between the Poisson and GP
   models. A bootstrap test is also proposed to adjust the underestimation
   of nominal level in the score statistic when the sample size is small.
   The simulation study indicates the bootstrap test has significance level
   closer to nominal size and has uniformly greater power than the score
   test based on asymptotic standard Normal distribution. From a practical
   perspective, we suggest that, if the score test gives even a weak
   indication that the Poisson model is inappropriate, say at the 0.10
   significance level, we advise the more accurate bootstrap procedure as a
   better test for comparing whether the GP model is more appropriate than
   Poisson model. Finally, the Vuong test is illustrated to choose between
   GP and NB2 models for the same dataset.}},

Title = {{Odds ratios from logistic, geometric, Poisson, and negative binomial
   regression models}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundThe odds ratio (OR) is used as an important metric of
   comparison of two or more groups in many biomedical applications when
   the data measure the presence or absence of an event or represent the
   frequency of its occurrence. In the latter case, researchers often
   dichotomize the count data into binary form and apply the well-known
   logistic regression technique to estimate the OR. In the process of
   dichotomizing the data, however, information is lost about the
   underlying counts which can reduce the precision of inferences on the
   OR.MethodsWe propose analyzing the count data directly using regression
   models with the log odds link function. With this approach, the
   parameter estimates in the model have the exact same interpretation as
   in a logistic regression of the dichotomized data, yielding comparable
   estimates of the OR. We prove analytically, using the Fisher information
   matrix, that our approach produces more precise estimates of the OR than
   logistic regression of the dichotomized data. We also show the gains in
   precision using simulation studies and real-world datasets. We focus on
   three related distributions for count data: geometric, Poisson, and
   negative binomial.ResultsIn simulation studies, confidence intervals for
   the OR were 56-65\% as wide (geometric model), 75-79\% as wide (Poisson
   model), and 61-69\% as wide (negative binomial model) as the
   corresponding interval from a logistic regression produced by
   dichotomizing the data. When we analyzed existing datasets using our
   approach, we found that confidence intervals for the OR could be up to
   64\% shorter (36\% as wide) compared to if the data had been
   dichotomized and analyzed using logistic regression.ConclusionsMore
   precise estimates of the OR can be obtained directly from the count data
   by using the log odds link function. This analytic approach is easy to
   implement in software packages that are capable of fitting generalized
   linear models or of maximizing user-defined likelihood functions.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials with multi-nonpositive indexes, especially for
   a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)/zero Poisson's ratio (ZPR), negative
   stiffness (NS)/zero stiffness (ZS), and negative thermal expansion
   (NTE)/zero thermal expansion (ZTE), have garnered significant interest
   due to their unprecedented mechanical properties and functional
   applications for advanced materials and devices. Architected materials
   with one abnormal index, such as auxetic materials, have been widely
   studied based on mature and diverse underlying mechanisms. However,
   metastructures with double or multiple abnormal indexes are rarely
   reported due to the possible coupling effects between the indexes.
   Herein, triple-negative-index (NPR, NS, and NTE) structural bistability
   is achieved using assembled composite materials with hexagonal auxetic
   frameworks and compressed buckled bistable snapping segments.
   Double-negative-one-zero-index (NS, NTE, and ZPR) or
   double-zero-one-negative-index (ZPR, ZTE, and NS) structural
   multistability is achieved using assembled composites with rectangular
   frameworks and compressed buckled bistable snapping segments.
   Particularly, angle-dependent transitions between robust structural
   bistability and multistability are achieved with controllable isotropic
   or anisotropic thermal expansion. This study demonstrates rationally
   designed metastructures with multiple abnormal indexes and the potential
   applications of multifunctional metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic constants of two-dimensional soft cyclic trimers, exhibiting
   asymmetry and atomic size dispersion, are studied at zero temperature.
   The molecules interact through a short-range, site-site, purely
   repulsive, n-inverse-power potential. The essential influence of the
   molecular asymmetry on the elastic properties is shown. Negative values
   of the Poisson's ratio are found for strongly asymmetric molecules. It
   is also shown that, at fixed number density in the system, by increasing
   the size dispersion of particles one can significantly increase the
   elastic constants and the Poisson's ratio. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The radial and axial thermal expansion of various ceramic fibres are
   assessed by direct measurements at 25-800-degrees-C. The room

   equipped either with a hot stage or with a tensile device. The
   experimental procedure is validated with gold and platinum wires. There
   is significant scatter of the data for all fibres which is tentatively
   ascribed to filament microtwists coupled with non-circular
   cross-sections, to departure from transverse isotropy, and to various
   fibre inhomogeneities. High modulus carbon fibres exhibit a thermal
   expansion which is higher radially than axially, the latter being often
   negative whereas the anisotropy is less pronounced for the high strength
   carbon fibre and almost nil for polycarbosilane Si-C-O fibre. The

Title = {{An analytical model for pore volume compressibility of reservoir rock}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{543-549}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The pore volume compressibility of reservoir rock is usually measured by
   volume method and the relation between compressibility and porosity
   follows the Hall plot. However, the volume method yields a high pore
   volume compressibility value and a negative correlation between
   compressibility and porosity. Both results illustrate that
   unconventional reservoirs with low porosity has higher elastic energy
   than conventional reservoirs with high porosity, which disagrees with
   the production practice.
   In this paper, volume method of pore volume compressibility is
   investigated and problems of Hall plot are analyzed. Then a novel
   analytical model on pore volume compressibility of reservoir rock is
   derived to resolve these problems. The reason on the improper results
   using volume method is discussed. The calculated results from our new
   model are validated by the experimental tests using mercury immersion
   method for pore volume compressibility measurement. The effects of
   compressibility on original oil in place and the flow radius are
   analyzed.
   The analytical model shows that pore volume compressibility of reservoir
   rock is related not only to porosity but also to elastic modulus and
   Poisson's ratio. There is a positive correlation between pore volume
   compressibility and porosity. The compressibility value of our model is
   much lower than that measured using volume method. The reason of the
   improper results from volume method is the micro interstice in core
   holder. Without the effects of micro interstice (mercury immersion
   method or loading and unloading stress treatment before the test), the
   measured pore volume compressibility shows a relatively low value and a
   positive correlation between pore compressibility and porosity, which
   validate the results of our analytical model. The pore volume
   compressibility calculated by volume method and Hall plot will
   overestimate the elastic energy of the reservoir and bring substantial
   errors in evaluation of original oil in place and the flow radius.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally and numerically investigate instability-induced
   pattern transformations and switchable auxetic behavior in multiphase
   composites consisted of circular voids and stiff inclusions periodically
   distributed in a soft elastomer. We specifically focus on the role of
   inclusion distribution on the behavior of the soft transformative
   composites. The inclusions are distributed in either square or
   triangular periodic configurations, while the voids are distributed in
   the triangular periodic array - the configurations enabling cooperative
   buckling induced transformations of the unit cells. Through the survey
   of microstructure parameter, we show that tailored positioning of the
   stiff inclusions can be exploited to expand the set of admissible
   switchable patterns in multiphase composites. Thus, extreme values of
   negative Poisson's ratio can be attained through applied strains;
   moreover, the onset of instabilities, and the corresponding switches to
   extremely soft behavior are shown to be controlled by the inclusion
   arrangements and volume fractions. Furthermore, the dependence of the
   microstructure buckling and post-buckling behavior on loading direction
   is investigated, and the composite anisotropic properties depending on
   the microstructure parameters are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging techniques involve counting of photons striking a detector. Due
   to fluctuations in the counting process, the measured photon counts are
   known to be corrupted by Poisson noise. In this paper, we propose a

   photographic image data from Poisson corrupted measurements acquired by
   a compressive camera. We exploit the inherent non-negativity of the data
   by modeling the dictionary as well as the sparse dictionary coefficients
   as non-negative entities, and infer these directly from the compressed
   measurements in a Poisson maximum likelihood framework. We
   experimentally demonstrate the advantage of this in situ dictionary

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of the uranyl squarate monohydrate material,
   (UO2) (C4O4) center dot H2O, were studied using theoretical solid-state
   methods based in density functional theory employing plane waves and
   pseudopotentials. Very demanding calculation parameters were utilized in
   order to obtain a realistic description of the mechanical behavior of
   this material. Since the determination of the positions of the hydrogen
   atoms in the unit cell of uranyl squarate monohydrate was not possible
   from x-ray diffraction data by structure refinement, they were fully
   optimized theoretically. The computed lattice parameters, bond
   distances, angles, and x-ray powder diffraction patterns of this
   material were in very good agreement with the experimental data. This
   material was found to be mechanically and dynamically stable since the
   corresponding stability conditions were satisfied. The values of the
   bulk modulus and its pressure derivatives, shear and Young moduli,
   Poisson ratio, ductility, hardness, and mechanical anisotropy indices of
   this material were reported. Furthermore, this study showed that this
   material exhibits the important negative Poisson ratio (NPR) and
   negative linear compressibility (NLC) phenomena. Uranyl squarate
   monohydrate is a very anisotropic brittle material characterized by a
   bulk modulus of similar to 33 GPa, which shows a minimum value of the
   NPR of the order of -0.5. Besides, this material displays NLC values for
   a limited range of positive pressures, from 0.025 GPa to 0.094GPa,
   applied along the direction of minimum negative Poisson ratio. The

Abstract = {{Aging, accidents and diseases are the leading causes of disability in
   today's world. Therefore, implants and prostheses for hard and soft
   tissues are becoming increasingly common to restore daily activity and
   improve the quality of life of patients. Although implants have been
   extensively developed and are in the clinical use, deformation
   mechanism, inflexibility and mismatch of the elastic and mechanical
   behavior of the implants with native tissues are challenges for tissue
   engineering. The objective of this study was to characterize auxetic
   polyurethane foam as an auxetic soft tissue implant based on
   mathematical modeling using a nonlinear elasticity theory. The
   compressibility effects on auxetic soft tissue implants due to
   equibiaxial loading were studied. Numerical results were computed using
   experimentally obtained data and compared with the non-auxetic behavior
   of a soft tissue.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation explored the viability of using open cell
   polyurethane auxetic foams to augment the conformable layer in a sports
   helmet and improve its linear impact acceleration attenuation. Foam
   types were compared by examining the impact severity on an instrumented
   anthropomorphic headform within a helmet consisting of three layers: a
   rigid shell, a stiff closed cell foam, and an open cell foam as a
   conformable layer. Auxetic and conventional foams were interchanged to
   act as the helmet's conformable component. Attenuation of linear
   acceleration was examined by dropping the combined helmet and headform
   on the front and the side. The helmet with auxetic foam reduced peak
   linear accelerations (p < 0.05) relative to its conventional counterpart
   at the highest impact energy in both orientations. Gadd Severity Index
   reduced by 11\% for frontal impacts (38.9 J) and 44\% for side impacts
   (24.3 J). The conformable layer within a helmet can influence the
   overall impact attenuating properties. The helmet fitted with auxetic
   foam can attenuate impact severity more than when fitted with
   conventional foam, and warrants further investigation for its potential
   to reduce the risk of traumatic brain injuries in sport specific
   impacts.}},

Title = {{Refined shear correction factor for very thick simply supported and
   uniformly loaded isosceles right triangular auxetic plates}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{For moderately thick plates, the use of First order Shear Deformation
   Theory (FSDT) with a constant shear correction factor of 5/6 is
   sufficient to take into account the plate deflection arising from
   transverse shear deformation. For very thick plates, the use of Third
   order Shear Deformation Theory (TSDT) is preferred as it allows the
   shear strain distribution to be varied through the plate thickness.
   Therefore no correction factor is required in TSDT, unlike FSDT. Due to
   the complexity involved in TSDT, this paper obtains a more accurate
   shear correction factor for use in FSDT of very thick simply supported
   and uniformly loaded isosceles right triangular plates based on the
   TSDT. By matching the maximum deflections for this plate according to
   FSDT and TSDT, a variable shear correction factor is obtained. Results
   show that the shear correction factor for the simplified TSDT, i.e.
   14/17, is least accurate. The commonly adopted shear correction factor
   of 5/6 in FSDT is valid only for very thin or highly auxetic plates.
   This paper provides a variable shear correction for FSDT deflection that
   matches the plate deflection by TSDT. This variable shear correction
   factor allows designers to justify the use of a commonly adopted shear
   correction factor of 5/6 even for very thick plates as long as the
   Poisson's ratio of the plate material is sufficiently negative.}},

Abstract = {{The torsion of a prismatic beam has been a classic problem of structural
   mechanics since the famous works of Saint-Venant. In this paper, an
   analysis is extended on a composite beam with elliptical cross-section.
   We consider a beam in which the elliptical cross-sectionis split into
   sectors in which two materials, one of which is auxetic, are distributed
   alternately. The influence of auxetic phase on the total elastic strain
   energy is analyzed as well as geometrical parameters representing both
   the shape of the cross- section, and the arrangements of sectors. An
   unexpected behavior of a beam with strong auxetic phase is presented as,
   in the case of selected parameters, the beam with elliptical
   cross-section is more rigid than the beam with a circular one. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In recent years, many structural motifs have been designed with the aim
   of creating auxetic metamaterials. One area of particular interest in
   this subject is the creation of auxetic material properties through
   elastic instability. Such metamaterials switch from conventional
   behaviour to an auxetic response for loads greater than some threshold
   value. This paper develops a novel methodology in the analysis of
   auxetic metamaterials which exhibit elastic instability through analogy
   with rigid link lattice systems. The results of our analytic approach
   are confirmed by finite-element simulations for both the onset of
   elastic instability and post-buckling behaviour including Poisson's
   ratio. The method gives insight into the relationships between
   mechanisms within lattices and their mechanical behaviour; as such, it
   has the potential to allow existing knowledge of rigid link lattices
   with auxetic paths to be used in the design of future buckling-induced
   auxetic metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the dynamic response of sandwich plates subjected
   to blast load. The sandwich plate is composed of auxetic honeycombs core
   layer with negative Poisson's ratio integrated with nanocomposite at the
   top and bottom surfaces. The nanocomposite layers are reinforced by
   carbon nanotubes (CNTs) where the effective material properties are
   calculated by Mori-Tanaka approach considering agglomeration effects.
   Due to the existence of CNTs, the structure is subjected to magnetic
   field. Based on the Kelvin-Voigt theory, the viscoelastic properties of
   the structure are considered. The viscoelastic medium is simulated by
   orthotropic visco-Pasternak model. Utilizing sinusoidal shear
   deformation theory (SSDT), the motion equations are derived based on
   Hamilton's principle. Differential cubature method (DCM) in conjunction
   with Newmark method is used for obtaining the dynamic deflection of the
   sandwich structure for different boundary conditions. The effects of
   various parameters such as structural damping, viscoelastic medium
   constants, geometric parameters of plates, volume fraction and
   agglomeration of CNTs, duration of blast pulse, geometrical parameters
   of auxetic honeycombs core and magnetic field on the dynamic deflection

Abstract = {{Poly(phenylacetylene) sheets that mimic the geometry of a wine-rack-like
   structure have been predicted to exhibit negative Poisson's ratios
   off-axis. However, their potential to exhibit negative linear
   compressibility (NLC) has remained largely unexplored. In this work, the
   compressibility and other mechanical properties of wine-rack-like
   poly(phenylacetylene) networks with 1,2,4,5 tetra-substituted phenyls as
   well as their equivalent with allene or cyclobutadiene centres are
   simulated to assess their ability to exhibit negative linear
   compressibility on-axis and off-axis. It is shown that some of these
   systems can indeed exhibit negative linear compressibility whilst others
   exhibit a near-zero compressibility. The results are compared to the
   compressibility properties of other poly(phenylacetylene) networks
   reported in literature as well as with those predicted from the
   analytical model for an idealised wine-rack structure deforming through
   hinging. Results suggest that these mechanical properties are arising
   from a wine-rack-like mechanism, and there is a good agreement with the
   theoretical model, especially for systems with longer acetylene chains
   whose geometry is closer to that of the idealised wine-rack.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the mechanical properties of the
   three-dimensional(3D) double-V honeycomb intersected by a
   two-dimensional double-V structure with negative Poisson's ratio.
   Considering the effect of the adjacent unit cells, the Poisson's ratio
   and Young'smodulus of the honeycomb under axial loading are derived
   theoretically. The finite element (FE) model of the 3D double-V
   honeycomb (DVH) is conducted to verify the theoretical solutions. It is
   found that the constraint of the adjacent cells does not affect the
   negative Poisson's ratio but enhance Young'smodulus a lot, and the two
   properties are determined by the stuffer/tensor angles. Then, the
   prototypes of the 3D DVH is manufactured to carry out the quasi-static
   experiments. The stiffness and the collapse stress of the theoretical,
   numerical and experimental solutions are compared, and it is evident
   that these results agree very well which indicates the analyses of these
   solutions are convinced. And the quasi-static collapse stress increases
   with the increment of tensor angle theta(1) and the reduction of stuffer
   angle theta(2). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the auxetic materials, auxetic reinforcement as well as
   auxetic composite are under the great attention of scientific research
   due to having excellent mechanical properties. In the current research
   work, the impact resistance of composite was improved by modifying the
   four layer through the thickness woven structure, that was used as
   reinforcement. A comparison was made between the standard four layer
   through the thickness and modified four layer through the thickness
   woven structure in terms of auxeticity and penetration. The modified
   four layer through the thickness woven structure showed auxetic behavior
   in both warp and weft direction having less penetration resistance as
   compared to standard sample. The four layer through the thickness
   non-auxetic woven structures and modified auxetic four layer thorough
   the thickness woven structures were used as reinforcements to develop
   composite for impact resistance comparison. The result showed that
   impact resistance of auxetic composite was 6.7\% greater as compared to
   the non-auxetic composite. It was concluded that the greater value of
   impact resistance was due to the auxetic behavior of modified four layer

Abstract = {{In this paper, impact testing of auxetic structures filled with strain
   rate sensitive material is presented. Two dimensional missing rib, 2D
   re-entrant honeycomb, and 3D re-entrant honeycomb lattices are
   investigated. Structures are divided into three groups according to type
   of filling: no filling, low expansion polyurethane foam, and ordnance
   gelatine. Samples from each group are tested under quasi-static loading
   and dynamic compression using Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar. Digital
   image correlation is used for assessment of in-plane displacement and
   strain fields. Ratios between quasi-static and dynamic results for
   plateau stresses and specific energy absorption in the plateau are
   calculated. It is found out that not only the manufactured structures,
   but also the wrought material exhibit strain rate dependent properties.
   Evaluation of influence of filling on mechanical properties shows that
   polyurethane increases specific absorbed energy by a factor of 1.05-1.4,
   whereas the effect of gelatine leads to increase of only 5-10\%.
   Analysis of the Poisson's function reveals influence of filling on
   achievable (negative) values of Poisson's ratio, when compared to
   unfilled specimens. The results for the Poisson's function yielded
   apparently different values as the assessed minima of quasi-static
   Poisson's ratio in small deformations are constrained by a factor of 15.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson ratio (NPR) materials based on a re-entrant honeycomb
   structure expand in the direction perpendicular to an externally exerted
   tension. This feature makes NPR structures attractive for use in
   microsensors and actuators as versatile motion transformers. When
   implemented in microdevices, where slender and flexible micromachined
   elements are widely used, the NPR material can tolerate large
   deflections. In the present work, motivated by the development of an
   optical sensor based on a photonic crystal device attached to a NPR
   based structure, we analyze the behavior of re-entrant honeycomb
   structures under large deflections. The model of the structure is built
   using extensible elastica theory for the description of geometrically
   nonlinear beams with an extensible axis. Results provided by the
   analytical model are compared with numerical results obtained by the
   finite element method. It is shown that the Poisson ratio (nu), which is
   defined entirely by the initial geometry of the structure undergoing
   small deflections, becomes strain dependent at large deflections. The
   extensibility of the beam's axis has a strong influence on the. of the
   structure at large deflections and leads to the appearance of a minimum
   on the strain-nu curve. An example of design is demonstrated which
   yields a desired strain-independent nu of the NPR structure under large
   deflections.}},

   geometrical structures. In most cases, however, the metamaterials built
   upon such geometries are foams or cellular solids. In this paper, a

Abstract = {{This study attempted to maximize the cell proliferation by delivering
   effective physical stimulation to cells by creating a negative Poisson's
   ratio by modifying the shape of the pores of the scaffold to cause
   effective bone cell proliferation in bone tissue regeneration. Polymer
   and ceramic materials used as scaffolds are poly(lactic-co-glycolic
   acid) (PLGA), hydroxyapatite (HA), and beta-tricalcium phosphate
   (beta-TCP). The support was prepared by salt leaching to provide an
   environment for cell survival, seeding MG-63 cells, and stimulating the
   support with a negative Poisson's ratio so that the cells were
   sufficiently stimulated. In the case of the control (PLGA/HA) support
   specimen, the cell proliferation rate when compressed stimulation was
   applied was about 21.4, 25.8, and 39.9\% higher than the proliferation
   rate without stimulation over 1, 3, and 5 days, respectively. The
   results showed that the experimental group (PLGA/HA/beta-TCP) scaffold
   specimens showed high results of 37.6, 57.7 and 71.6\% when compression
   stimulation was applied. This means that the PLGA/HA/beta-TCP scaffolds,
   which replaced the amount of HA with beta-TCP about 40\%, helped the
   growth of bone cells by about 30\%, compared with the previous study
   PLGA/HA composite scaffolds in compression stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{Within this study, new bolt heads were designed to be able to expand in
   drill holes as the load applied on the bolt shank increases. The heads
   of newly designed rock bolts include a conic part and split rings
   encircling them. To determine load bearing capacities of new rock bolts
   with varying angles of the conic parts and expansion properties, a
   series of deformation controlled pull-out tests were carried out by
   using bolt samples grouted in rock blocks. In addition to the
   experimental studies, numerical modelling analyses were performed to
   better understand the support properties of newly designed rock bolts.
   Because of a negative Poisson's ratio effect supplied by the head part
   expansion with the tension of the shank, new bolt heads are suggested to
   be defined as auxetic. According to the results of this study, the new
   head designs significantly improve the load bearing and energy
   absorption capacities of grouted rock bolts.}},

Abstract = {{The innovative design of orthopedic implants could play an important
   role in the development of life-lasting implants, by improving both
   primary and secondary implant fixations. The concept of
   meta-biomaterials aims to achieve a unique combination of mechanical,
   mass transport, and biological properties through optimized topological
   design of additively manufactured (AM) porous biomaterials. In this
   study, we primarily focused on a specific class of meta-biomaterials,
   namely auxetic meta-biomaterials. Their extraordinary behavior of
   lateral expansion in response to axial tension could potentially improve
   implant-bone contact in certain orthopedic applications. In this work, a
   multitude of auxetic meta-biomaterials were rationally designed and
   printed from Ti-6Al-4V using a commercially available laser powder bed
   fusion process called selective laser melting. The reentrant hexagonal
   honeycomb unit cell was used as a starting point, which was then
   parametrically tuned to obtain a variety of mechanical and morphological
   properties. In this two-step study, the morphology and quasistatic
   properties of the developed meta-biomaterials were assessed using
   mechanical experiments accompanied with full-field strain measurements
   using digital image correlation. In addition, all our designs were
   computationally modelled using the finite element method. Our results
   showed the limits of the AM processes for the production of auxetic
   meta-biomaterials in terms of which values of the design parameters
   (e.g., re-entrant angle, relative density, and aspect ratio) could be
   successfully manufactured. We also found that the AM process itself
   imparts significant influence on the morphological and mechanical
   properties of the resulting auxetic metabiomaterials. This further
   highlights the importance of experimental studies to determine the
   actual mechanical properties of such metamaterials. The elastic modulus
   and strength of many of our designs fell within the range of those
   reported for both trabecular and cortical bone. Unprecedented properties
   like these could be used to simultaneously address the different
   challenges faced in the mechanical design of orthopedic implants.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops an auxetic cantilever beam energy harvester (ACBEH)
   to enhance the harvesting power from ambient vibration sources. A finite
   element analysis was performed to verify the power increase mechanism of
   the ACBEH. The simulation model of the ACBEH comprises of three main
   components: support, tip mass, and cantilever beam with a re-entrant
   hexagonal auxetic structure in which a piezoelectric element bonded to
   top of the auxetic region by using a thin elastic layer of epoxy. The
   performance of the ACBEH was computationally investigated and compared
   with an equivalent conventional energy harvester with a plain cantilever
   beam where they are attached to a bridge stay cable. The simulation
   result shows that the ACBEH excited by a harmonic acceleration of 1
   m/s(2) at 3 Hz is able to produce electric power of 427.22 mu W, which
   is 2.51 times that of the power produced by the equivalent plain
   cantilever beam energy harvester (170.17 mu W). This paper opens up a
   great potential of using auxetic cantilever beam applications for
   different energy harvesting systems in Metamaterials, Acoustics, Civil,

Abstract = {{The main goal of this study is using analytical solution to investigate
   the nonlinear dynamic response and vibration of sandwich auxetic
   composite cylindrical panels. The sandwich composite panels have three
   layers in which the top and bottom outer skins are isotropic aluminum
   materials, the central auxetic core layer-honeycomb structures with
   negative Poisson's ratio using the same aluminum material. The panels
   are resting on elastic foundations and subjected to mechanical, blast
   and damping loads. Based on Reddy's first order shear deformation theory
   (FSDT) with the geometrical nonlinear in von Karman and using the Airy
   stress functions method, Galerkin method and fourth-order Runge-Kutta
   method, the resulting equations are solved to obtain expressions for
   nonlinear motion equations. The effects of geometrical parameters,
   material properties, elastic Winkler and Pasternak foundations,
   mechanical, blast and damping loads on the nonlinear dynamic response
   and the natural frequencies of sandwich composite cylindrical panels are
   studied. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Within nowadays research, when it comes to lightweight sandwich panels,
   periodic cellular structures are considered real trendsetters. One of
   the most used type of core in producing sandwich panels is the
   honeycomb. However, due to its relatively high manufacturing cost, this
   structure has limited applications; therefore, research has been earned
   out in order to develop alternative solutions. An example in this sense
   is the ExpaAsym cellular structure, developed at the Transilvania
   University of Brasov; it represents a periodic cellular structure
   manufactured through a mechanically expansion process of a previously
   cut and perforated sheet material. The relative density of the structure
   was proven to be significantly lower than the one of the honeycomb. This
   gives a great advantage to the structure, due to the fact that when the
   internal angle A of the unit cell is 60, after the mechanical expansion
   it results a hexagonal structure. The main objective of this paper is to
   estimate the in-plane Poisson ratios of the structure, in terms of its
   geometrical parameters. it is therefore analytically shown that for
   certain values of the geometric parameters, the in-plane Poisson ratios
   have negative values when the internal angle exceeds 90, which
   determines its auxetic behavior.}},

   deformation}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic behavior (i.e., a negative value of Poisson's ratio) has been
   reported for a variety of cellular networks including truss structures.
   Commonly, this implies that the geometric arrangement of truss members
   within a periodic unit cell is designed to achieve the negative Poisson
   effect, e.g., in the reentrant honeycomb configuration. Here, we show
   that elastic periodic truss lattices can be tuned to display auxeticity
   by controlling the ratio of bending to stretching stiffness. If the
   nodal stiffness (or the bending stiffness) is low compared to the
   stretching stiffness of individual truss members, then the lattice is
   expected to exhibit a positive Poisson's ratio, showing lateral
   expansion upon uniaxial compression. In contrast, if the nodal or
   bending stiffness is high (and buckling is prevented), the lattice may
   reveal auxetic behavior, contracting laterally under uniaxial
   compression. This effect is demonstrated in two dimensions for the
   examples of square and triangular lattices, and it is confirmed both
   analytically in the limit of small strains as well as numerically for
   finite elastic deformation. Under large deformation, instability
   additionally gives rise to auxetic behavior due to truss buckling.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation of the mechanical behaviors on hierarchical re-entrant
   honeycomb structures was undertaken using finite element method. The
   hierarchical structure with a hierarchy order n (n >= 1) was constructed
   by replacing each vertex of a re-entrant hexagonal structure of
   hierarchy order n - 1 with a smaller re-entrant hexagon with identical
   geometry aspect ratio. The Poisson's ratio and energy absorption
   capacity of re-entrant structures of different hierarchy orders were
   studied under various compression velocities. The minimum Poisson's
   ratios of the first-order (n = 1) and second-order (n = 2) hierarchical
   re-entrant structures were - 1.581 and - 1.823, respectively; they were
   32.9 and 53.2\% lower than that of a zeroth-order hierarchical structure
   (i.e., conventional re-entrant hexagon). The second-order hierarchical
   structure exhibited the highest rate of increase in energy absorption
   capacity with an increasing compression velocity. The plateau stresses
   of the first- and second-order hierarchical structures were lower than
   that of the zeroth-order hierarchical structure; however, the
   second-order hierarchical structure exhibited the highest energy
   absorption capacity at high compression velocity rate (v > 40 m/s). The
   energy absorption capacities of the first- and second-order hierarchical
   structures proposed in the present study are 1.5 and 1.8 times,
   respectively, higher than those of the hierarchical re-entrant
   structures proposed in our previous work (Li et al. in Smart Mater
   Struct 26:025014, 2017).}},

   negative Poisson's ratio and tunable magnetism by doping}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Based on first-principles calculations, we predict a stable
   two-dimensional semiconductor, namely tin dioxide SnO2. By investigating
   its dynamical, thermal, and mechanical properties, we find that SnO2
   monolayer is an auxetic material with a large in-plane negative
   Poisson's ratio. Furthermore, our results show that SnO2 is an
   indirect-gap semiconductor with a band gap in the region of 3.7 eV and
   an extremely high electron mobility, similar to 10(3) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1).
   Interestingly, the band structure of SnO2 presents double
   Mexican-hat-like band edges in the valence bands near the Fermi level.
   Due to such a unique band feature, a ferromagnetic phase transition
   takes place with a half-metallic ground state that can be induced by
   hole doping within a very wide concentration range. Such a magnetic
   phase can be well explained by the Stoner mechanism. A peculiar feature
   of the magnetic state is the presence of large magnetocrystalline
   anisotropy that can switch from in-plane to out-of-plane upon hole
   doping. Hence, SnO2 monolayer can be tuned to be either an XY magnet or
   an Ising one, with a magnetic critical temperature above room
   temperature at proper hole concentrations. These findings demonstrate
   that the predicted phase of SnO2 is a rare example of p-type magnetism
   and a possible candidate for spintronic applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper effect of the orientation of the main crystallographic
   axes on the piezoelectric anisotropy and hydrostatic parameters of 2-2
   parallel-connected single crystal (SC) / auxetic polymer composites is
   analysed. SCs are chosen among the perovskite-type relaxor-ferroelectric
   solid solutions of (1 - x)Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O-3-xPbTiO(3) and
   xPb(In1/2Nb1/2)O-3-yPb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3-(1 - x - y)PbTiO3. The SC layers
   in a composite sample are poled along the perovskite unit-cell {[} 011]
   direction and characterised by mm2 symmetry. The orientation of the main
   crystallographic axes in the SC layer is observed to strongly influence
   the effective piezoelectric coefficients d(3j){*}, g(3j){*}, squared
   figured of merit d(3j){*} g(3j){*}, electromechanical coupling factors
   k(3j){*} (j = 1, 2 and 3), and hydrostatic analogs of these parameters
   of the 2-2 composite. A comparison of values of d(3j){*}g(3j){*} was
   first carried out at d(31){*} not equal d(32){*} in a wide range of
   orientations and volume-fraction. Large values of the effective
   parameters and inequalities vertical bar d(33){*} / d(3f){*}vertical bar
   > 5 and vertical bar k(33){*} / k(3f){*}vertical bar > 5 (f = 1 and 2)
   are achieved at specific orientations of the main crystallographic axes
   due to the anisotropy of elastic and piezoelectric properties of the SC
   component. The use of an auxetic polyethylene with a negative Poisson's
   ratio leads to a significant increase in the hydrostatic parameters of
   the 2-2 composite. Particular advantages of the studied composites over
   the conventional ceramic / polymer composites are taken into account for
   transducer, hydroacoustic and energyharvesting applications.}},

   a conventional soft foam, and two auxetic foams. We find that for the
   first two materials, having nu >= 0.2, the experimental determinations
   of Poisson's ratio are in good agreement with values calculated from the
   shear and tensile moduli using the equations of classical elasticity.
   However, for the two auxetic materials (nu < 0), the equations of
   classical elasticity give values significantly different from the
   measured nu. We offer an interpretation of these results based on a
   recently published analysis of the bounds on Poisson's ratio for
   classical elasticity to be applicable. Copyright 2013 Author(s). All

Abstract = {{The elastic properties of cristobalite and quartz, the typical
   polymorphs of SiO2, are studied with particular emphasis on the
   structural phase transition and the high-temperature phase. Using the
   equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) method with a stress-fluctuation
   formula, we have successfully evaluated the adiabatic elastic constants
   (C-ij) of both cristobalite and quartz in a wide temperature range,
   including the alpha-beta phase-transition region. In the results for
   cristobalite, the anomalous property of a negative Poisson's ratio
   appears over the entire temperature range of 300-1800 K, where the bulk
   modulus is extremely low compared with the shear modulus. However, the
   mechanisms differ between the alpha- and beta phases, according to the
   structural data obtained from the MD simulations. On the other hand,
   quartz exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio in the narrow temperature
   region between ca. 750 and 825 K before the phase transition occurs.
   After the transition to the beta-phase, the bulk modulus is shown to
   increase sharply, and a positive value of Poisson's ratio is recovered.
   For cristobalite as well as quartz, we have confirmed that the recovery
   of bulk C-ij's in the beta-phase can be attributed to internal
   relaxations, which arise from the cooperative motions of corner-linked
   SiO4, tetrahedra. (c) 2005 WILEYNCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures exhibiting non-linear deformation are a prevalent
   research topic in the material sciences due to their negative Poisson's
   ratio. The auxetic behavior is most efficiently accomplished through
   buckling or hinging of 3d printed structures created with soft or
   flexible materials. These structures have been hypothesized to have some
   unique characteristics and may provide advantages over conventional
   engineering materials in certain applications. The objective of present
   study is to gain a better understanding of behavior of auxetic
   structures subjected to tensile, compressive and impact loads and assess
   geometric parameters affecting these structures in applications such as
   impact shielding or biomedicine. Analytical and experimental methods
   were employed to investigate two different types of auxetic structures
   which were 3d-printed with TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane). The first
   was based on symmetric re-entrant angles cells patterned to form
   sheet-like structure. Rotation of members in opposite directions in a
   cell induces negative Poisson's ratio when the structure is subjected to
   tensile loading. The second structure was based on rectangular lattice
   of circular holes. This structure exhibited auxeticity due to formation
   of pattern of alternating mutually orthogonal ellipses when subjected to
   compressive and impact loads. Parameters of interest in this study
   included hardness of the plastic used in printing the structures, the
   fill pattern of 3d-printed solid parts, porosity of cylinders in the
   lattice structure, angles and thickness of members in the re-entrant
   structure. Preliminary results indicated that per unit weight of
   material, the re-entrant structure requires less tensile load to strain
   than a solid structure. This is advantageous in applications where
   expansion in lateral direction is required. The lattice of circular
   holes structure exhibited similar trend in impact and compressive
   loading. The results indicate that geometric parameters influence
   auxeticity of the structure a great deal. When the porosity of the
   lattice is too small, positive Poisson's ratio is observed. The length
   to height ratio of the re-entrant cell has similar effect on the
   structure's Poisson's ratio. The main advantage gained by employing such
   structures is their overall ability to resist buckling and withstand
   impact load without cracking. This study will help to develop
   3D-printing techniques in manufacturing better performing structures
   under similar conditions.}},

Title = {{The Development of a New Shock Absorbing Uniaxial Graded Auxetic Damper
   (UGAD)}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic structures are efficient cellular materials that can absorb
   blast/impact energy through plastic deformation, thus protecting the
   structure. They are developing sacrificial solutions with light weight,
   high specific strength, high specific toughness and excellent energy
   dissipating properties, due to its negative Poison's ratio nature. The
   use of auxetic and non-auxetic panels in blast resistant structures had
   been relatively perceived by researchers. Nonetheless, implementation of
   those energy dissipaters, explicitly as a uni-axial passive damper is
   restrained to limited studies, which highlight the potential need for
   further explorations. The aim of this paper is the design of a new
   uniaxial graded auxetic damper (UGAD) that can be used as a
   blast/impact/shock absorber in different scales for different structural
   applications. First, the geometry, material, numerical model and loading
   are introduced. Then, a detailed parametric study is conducted to
   achieve the most efficient graded auxetic system. Moreover, the designed
   auxetic damper is numerically tested and its static and dynamic
   constitutive relations are derived and validated analytically. The
   selection of optimum parameters was based on the ratio of the reaction
   force to the applied load (RFd/P) and plastic dissipation energy (PDE).
   The final designed UGAD contains three auxetic cores that have the same
   geometry, material grade (6063-T4), size and number of layers equal to
   eight. The cell-wall thickness t of the three auxetic cores is 1.4 mm,
   1.8 mm and 2.2 mm, respectively; composing a graded auxetic system. The
   performance of the three auxetic cores together have led to a wide
   plateau region (80\% of total crushing strain) and variant strength
   range (1-10 MPa), which in return, can justify the superior performance
   of the UGAD under different blast levels. Finally, the 3D printed
   prototype of the UGAD is presented and the possible applications are
   covered.}},

   using PLA/TPU/CNT filament embedded synergistically with continuous
   carbon fiber: A theoretical \& experimental analysis}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{220}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{A novel strategy is proposed to fabricate continuous fiber-reinforced
   electro-induced shape memory auxetic composites (CFRSMCs) by combining
   conductive filaments and continuous carbon fiber through 3D printing
   technology. In the first step, the conductive filaments were
   manufactured based on Poly-lactic-acid/
   Thermoplastic-urethane/Carbon-nanotube (PLA/TPU/CNT) blend
   nanocomposite, and the CFRSMCs were then prepared, composing different
   carbonaceous fiber content with a variety of extrusion width. The main
   aim of the present work is to evaluate the mechanical, electrical, and
   thermal properties as well as the shape memory effect (SME). With regard
   to this, the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the printed CFRSMCs was
   precisely assessed through tensile measurement, and a well-adjusted
   theoretical model was employed for further predictions. Accordingly, as
   compared to free-fiber printed samples, the CFRSMCs exhibited superb
   mechanical properties and rapid electro-induced SME (a recovery ratio of
   94\% under 10 V within 25 s). Moreover, due to tailoring coconductive
   networks by the CNTs and carbon fibers in the printed composites, a
   great deal of activation capability in the auxetic CFRSMCs could be
   revealed by various stimuli and for smart applications. This advanced
   strategy indicates a great potential to fabricate various auxetic
   electro-induced CFRSMCs used in small scale of deployable trusses or
   other lightweight smart components like adaptive energy absorption
   devices and humanscale orthopedic materials.}},

Title = {{Tuning the Performance of Metallic Auxetic Metamaterials by Using
   Buckling and Plasticity}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Metallic auxetic metamaterials are of great potential to be used in many
   applications because of their superior mechanical performance to
   elastomer-based auxetic materials. Due to the limited knowledge on this
   new type of materials under large plastic deformation, the
   implementation of such materials in practical applications remains
   elusive. In contrast to the elastomer-based metamaterials, metallic ones
   possess new features as a result of the nonlinear deformation of their
   metallic microstructures under large deformation. The loss of auxetic
   behavior in metallic metamaterials led us to carry out a numerical and
   experimental study to investigate the mechanism of the observed
   phenomenon. A general approach was proposed to tune the performance of
   auxetic metallic metamaterials undergoing large plastic deformation
   using buckling behavior and the plasticity of base material. Both
   experiments and finite element simulations were used to verify the
   effectiveness of the developed approach. By employing this approach, a
   2D auxetic metamaterial was derived from a regular square lattice. Then,
   by altering the initial geometry of microstructure with the desired
   buckling pattern, the metallic metamaterials exhibit auxetic behavior
   with tuneable mechanical properties. A systematic parametric study using
   the validated finite element models was conducted to reveal the novel
   features of metallic auxetic metamaterials undergoing large plastic
   deformation. The results of this study provide a useful guideline for
   the design of 2D metallic auxetic metamaterials for various
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The radial stretching of a hollow thin membrane without compressive
   strength is considered within the framework of the small strain tension
   field theory. For each type of the uniform boundary conditions, the
   loading plane is partitioned into the domains of biaxial tension,
   tension field and buckling. The extent of these domains critically
   depends on the value of the Poisson's coefficient and on the aspect
   ratio of the membrane. The stress and displacement fields are determined
   at an arbitrary stage of loading, when the outer biaxially stressed
   (taut) annulus surrounds the inner (tension field) portion of the
   membrane, characterized by continuously distributed infinitesimal
   wrinkles. The growth of the tension field as the loading increases is
   analyzed. It is shown that, depending on the Poisson's coefficient and
   the aspect ratio of the membrane, the tension field may or may not
   spread throughout the whole membrane. For the fixed outer boundary, and
   the applied tension or a negative displacement at the inner boundary,
   and for a particular combination of the material and geometric
   parameters, the tension field instantly spreads to a specific depth
   within the membrane, dependent on the Poisson's ratio and the outer
   radius of the membrane, remaining constant during further increase of
   the loading.}},

Abstract = {{The critical buckling loads of pinned-pinned and cantilever beams are

   interest are beams that are either anisotropic or auxetic. For

Abstract = {{An extensive investigation is carried out on the missing rib square grid
   structure using finite element simulations. This showed that, in the
   cases considered in this study, the type of deformation is primarily
   dependent on the ratio of the thickness of different ribs with the
   structure behaving like an anti-tetrachiral at particular ratios. The
   analysis also showed that the ability of the structure to deform
   predominantly through the bending of the ligament allows it to achieve
   much more negative values of the Poisson's ratio than previously
   reported. Confirmation of the numerical results is obtained through
   experimental methods involving the 3D printing of representative
   structures which are subsequently subjected to compression.}},

Title = {{Multi-objective crashworthiness optimization for an auxetic cylindrical
   structure under axial impact loading}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in designing lightweight automobile
   parts to enhance the passive safety of automobiles and reduce the fuel
   cost consumption. Variable kinds of novel smart structures/materials
   have been studied to apply in the field of the crashworthiness of the
   automobile. In this paper, a novel crash box based on the cylindrical
   cellular structure with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) is proposed. The
   unit cell for the NPR structure is the double-V configuration. The
   structure can contract in the radial direction when compressed to
   enhance the stiffness. Then the parametric finite element (FE) model is
   constructed with MATLAB scripts to study the influence of the
   geometrical parameters on the crashworthiness. During the analysis, the
   Rescaled Range Analysis (RRA) is utilized. Then the specific energy
   absorption (SEA) and peak crushing force (PCF) are chosen as the
   optimization objective, and the Pareto fronts are attained by employing
   the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm. Also,
   the optimal results are compared with the initial model to verify the
   effectiveness of the approach. It is found that the SEA increases from
   4.33 M/Kg to 6.06 KJ/kg by 39.3\% and PCF decreases to 78.89 KN by
   10.3\% when the geometry parameters are optimized. Compared with the
   thin-walled circle structure, the cylindrical NPR structure has lower
   peak crushing force and higher energy absorption. Also, the crushing
   force is more stable under the impact loading. Therefore, the
   cylindrical NPR structure has a great prospect in the application of the
   energy absorber of the automobile. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS}},

Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{443-449}},

Abstract = {{The combined influence of material auxeticity, strain and lateral
   boundary condition on the longitudinal wave speed in a prismatic rod of
   circular cross-section is developed herein. The lateral surface of the
   rod is elastically restrained in the radial direction such that twisting
   and bending are prevented while the axial displacement is fully
   permitted. As such, the imposition of zero and infinite radial spring
   stiffness reduces this model into longitudinal wave motion in a
   prismatic rod with free side surface and a plane wave of dilatation,
   respectively. The wave speed was made dimensionless by two ways, i.e. by
   normalizing against the elementary wave speed in prismatic rods and
   against the speed of plane waves of dilatation. Both approaches
   demonstrate the manner by which the wave speed transits between the two
   extreme lateral boundary conditions: from being a purely rod (1D stress
   with 3D strain) to a purely bulk (3D stress with 1D strain) wave motion,
   with the strain and material properties taken into consideration.
   Results indicate that the wave speed is increased by (a) greater radial
   elastic restraint stiffness, (b) more positive longitudinal strain, and
   (c) the higher Poisson's ratio magnitude of the rod material. These
   results also suggest that the adjustment of wave speed is more easily
   controlled in the auxetic region than in the conventional region.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an effective and efficient topology optimization method,
   termed as Isogeometric Topology Optimization (ITO), is proposed for
   systematic design of both 2D and 3D auxetic metamaterials based on
   isogeometric analysis (IGA). Firstly, a density distribution function
   (DDF) with the desired smoothness and continuity, to represent the
   topological changes of structures, is constructed using the Shepard
   function and non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) basis functions.
   Secondly, an energy-based homogenization method (EBHM) to evaluate
   material effective properties is numerically implemented by IGA, with
   the imposing of the periodic boundary formulation on material
   microstructure. Thirdly, a topology optimization formulation for 2D and
   3D auxetic metamaterials is developed based on the DDF, where the
   objective function is defined as a combination of the homogenized
   elastic tensor and the IGA is applied to solve the structural responses.
   A relaxed optimality criteria (OC) method is used to update the design
   variables, due to the non-monotonic property of the problem. Finally,
   several numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed method. A series of auxetic microstructures
   with different deformation mechanisms (e.g. the re-entrant and chiral)
   can be obtained. The auxetic behavior of material microstructures are
   numerically validated using ANSYS, and the optimized designs are
   prototyped using the Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technique. (C) 2019

   the culture through periodic sampling where knowledge about the spatial
   distribution of the pest is a fundamental part to improve sampling and
   control decisions. The objective of this work was to study the spatial
   distribution pattern and build a sequential sampling plan for the pest.
   The data used were gathered from two blocks of Valencia sweet orange on
   a farm in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, by 40 inspectors trained for the data
   collection. The following aggregation indices were calculated:
   variance/mean ratio, Morisita index, Green's coefficient, and k
   parameter of the negative binomial distribution. The data were tested
   for fit with Poisson and negative binomial distributions using the
   chi-square goodness of fit test. The sequential sampling was developed
   using Wald's Sequential Probability Ratio Test and validated through
   simulations. We concluded that the spatial distribution of B. phoenicis
   is aggregated, its behavior best fitted to the negative binomial
   distribution and we built and validated a sequential sampling plan for
   control decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed study of the behavior under pressure of four important
   organic acids using the first-principles solid-state methodology is
   presented. These organic acids are the l-(+)-lactic, maleic, succinic
   and citric acids. The citric acid monohydrate is also investigated. The
   computed crystal structures and associated X-ray diffraction patterns
   are in very good agreement with their experimental counterparts. The
   elastic tensors of these materials are determined using the finite
   deformation method and the mechanical stability of their structures is
   studied. A set of relevant elastic properties is obtained in terms of
   the computed elastic tensors. This set includes the bulk, shear and
   Young moduli, the Poisson's ratio, the ductility, hardness and
   anisotropy indices and the bulk modulus pressure derivatives. In the
   solid state, these organic acids are shown to be stable, relatively weak
   and very anisotropic materials and, with the exception of citric acid
   monohydrate, all of them exhibit the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   phenomenon. The deformation of the crystal structures under isotropic
   pressures and anisotropic stresses is then evaluated and analyzed. The
   organic acids considered display the negative linear compressibility
   (NLC) phenomenon in several narrow pressure ranges. The presence of
   large NLC effects in these materials is mainly related to the onset of
   pressure induced phase transitions or sudden structural rearrangements.
   The lactic acid exhibits a large NLC effect under the effect of
   isotropic pressures due to the proximity of a pressure induced phase
   transition occurring at a pressure of P similar to 1.0 GPa. The maleic
   acid shows NLC under isotropic pressures of the order of P similar to
   1.1 GPa but no phase transition is observed. Under anisotropic stresses
   directed along the minimum Poisson's ratio direction, maleic acid also
   shows a large NLC effect at small external pressures of P similar to 0.1
   GPa. Succinic acid displays small NLC effects in several pressure ranges
   under isotropic pressures but large NLC values under anisotropic
   stresses directed along the minimum NPR direction because it undergoes a
   pressure induced phase transition near P similar to 1.5 GPa. Finally,
   the citric acid shows small NLC values for negative isotropic pressures
   near -0.5 GPa and a large NLC effect under low anisotropic stresses (P
   similar to 0.1 GPa) which is accompanied by the breaking of one
   intramolecular hydrogen bond present in this material at zero pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Phytophagous stink bugs are major soybean pests, and knowledge of
   spatial distribution models of the pest in the crop is fundamental to
   establishing an appropriate sequential sampling plan, and thus, allowing
   the correct utilization of control strategies. This work aimed to study
   the spatial distribution of phytophagous stink bugs in soybean grown in
   different cropping systems and determine a sequential sampling plan. The
   experiment was conducted in Maracaju, MS, Brazil, during the
   agricultural year of 2012/2013. Soybean cultivars BRS 284 and SYN 1163
   RR were placed in an experimental area comprising six fields (two
   soybean cultivars x three cropping systems). Sampling was performed
   weekly, using a beat cloth per plot and counting the number of stink
   bugs found, virtually throughout the soybean reproductive period.
   Concerning the statistical analyses, we used the dispersion indexes
   (variance-to-mean ratio, Morisita's index, exponent k of the negative
   binomial and Green's coefficient) and probabilistic methods of frequency
   adjustment (negative binomial and Poisson). Adult and nymph phytophagous
   stink bugs showed aggregate disposition in the field regardless of the
   cropping system, and their numbers were adjusted to the negative
   binomial probability distribution. There was no difference in the
   behaviour of adult and nymphs considering the tested cultivars. We
   elaborated a practical sequential sampling plan for phytophagous stink
   bug complexes, considering crops intended for the production of grains
   and seeds.}},

   derived parameters such as Young's modulus (220-240 GPa), Poisson's
   ratio (0.163-0.188), and the Debye temperature (503.33 K). Moreover, the
   compound has an indirect bandgap of 1.37 eV, which is close to the ideal
   value of 1.40 eV for the solar light absorber. Its merit factor (ZT)
   varies from 0.96 and 0.92 for temperatures ranging between 300 and 900 K
   and a high value of the Seebeck coefficient (S) of 2750 mu V/K at 300;
   these two important parameters allow the B2BiN structure to have an
   improvement in thermoelectric performance and can be a potential
   candidate for solar panel devices. To the best of our knowledge and

Abstract = {{In this research, first-principles calculations were carried out within
   the density functional theory (DFT) framework, using LDA and GGA, in
   order to study the structural, elastic, electronic and thermal
   properties of InAs in the zinc-blende structure. The results of the
   structural properties (a, B-0, B'(0)) agree with the theoretical and
   experimental results reported by other authors. Additionally, the
   elastic properties, the elastic constants (C-11, C-12 and C-44), the
   anisotropy coefficient (A) and the predicted speeds of the sound (V-1,
   V-2 and V-s2) are in agreement with the results reported by other
   authors. In contrast, the shear modulus (G), the Young's modulus (Y) and
   the Poisson's ratio (v) show some discrepancy with respect to the
   experimental values, although, the values obtained are reasonable. On
   the other hand, it is evident the tendency of the LDA and GGA approaches
   to underestimate the value of the band-gap energy in semiconductors. The
   thermal properties (V, B-0, theta(D)yC(V)) of InAs, calculated using the
   quasi-harmonic Debye model, are slightly sensitive as the temperature
   increases. According to the stability criteria and the negative value of
   the enthalpy of formation, InAs is mechanically and thermodynamically
   stable. Therefore, this work can be used as a future reference for
   theoretical and experimental studies based on InAs.}},

Abstract = {{Thermo-mechanical buckling analysis of the orthotropic auxetic plates
   (with negative Poisson ratios) has not been performed so far,
   especially, in the hygrothermal environments. The complexity increases
   when the auxetic plate is fabricated from functionally graded
   orthotropic materials and surrounded by an elastic foundation. The
   aforementioned analyses are carried out in the present research, for the
   first time. The buckling loads may be uniaxial or biaxial ones.
   Moreover, temperature and moisture dependent material properties are
   considered. The pre-buckling effects are also considered in the paper.
   The high-order shear-deformation governing differential equations are
   solved based on a new differential quadrature method (DQM). The
   resulting solution may cover many practical simpler applications. A
   comprehensive parametric study is accomplished for a wide range of
   geometric and material properties parameters and various boundary
   conditions. Results reveal that the hygrothermal conditions lead to
   degradations in the material properties and buckling strengths,
   especially for higher gradation exponents, the elastic foundation may
   enhance the buckling behavior through monitoring the buckling pattern,
   the buckling load decreases as the orthotropy angle increases, and the
   auxeticity has reduced the buckling strength for the employed material
   and environmental information. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Through the achievement of elastic parameter equivalence by the
   structural mechanics method, the beam truss space frame model for
   graphene sheet has been simplified; moreover a representative unit cell
   of the periodic grapheme structure has been extracted. On this basis,
   the Bloch theorem is combined with the finite element method to
   determine the phonon dispersion relation of graphene. For the widely
   used thickness values of the carbon-carbon (C-C) bond, the aspect ratios
   (thickness/length) are so large that the shear deformation should be
   considered such that as a result, the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   characteristic of the C-C bond is observed. Analytical expressions for
   the elastic constants of graphene sheet have been obtained with varied
   C-C bond Poisson's ratios. The reasonable coherence with previous
   results reveals the effectiveness of the structural mechanics method for
   analysing the mechanical properties of nanostructures. The effect of
   deformation modes on the phonon dispersion relation of graphene sheet is
   further discussed; it is concluded that the acoustic phonon modes are
   sensitive to the deformation modes of the C-C bond, whereas these
   deformation modes negligibly influence the optical phonon modes. The
   numerical results also reveal that the shear deformation and the
   resulting NPR effect play an important role in the mechanical property
   analysis of graphene sheet. To summarise, the interrelation between NPR
   materials and nano materials has stimulated a wide field of research;
   moreover, numerous novel phenomena have been observed.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic instability has been increasingly used to design
   buckling-induced auxetic metamaterials. However, only limited patterns
   of existing three dimensional (3D) buckling-induced auxetic
   metamaterials exhibit a reliable 3D auxetic behaviour, i.e., the
   material will contract along two normal lateral directions under
   compression along the third direction. In this paper, we study a simple
   geometrical shape for achieving 3D auxetic behaviour. The unit cell of
   the proposed 3D design is composed of a solid sphere and three cuboids.
   Two representative models, one with slender connecting bars and the
   other with thick connecting bars, are investigated both numerically and
   experimentally. The results indicate that the designed material with
   thick connecting bars did not exhibit auxetic behaviour while the one
   with slender connecting bars did. However, the anticipated 3D auxetic
   behaviour degraded to a two dimensional (2D) auxetic behaviour, i.e.,
   the material would contract only in one lateral direction and maintain
   nearly the same dimension in the other lateral direction. This finding
   was further confirmed by experiments. This research has demonstrated
   challenges in designing and manufacturing of buckling-induced auxetic
   metamaterials with 3D auxetic behaviour and highlighted the importance
   of optimising and fine-tuning the auxetic unit cell using the pattern
   scale factor. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials have evolved growing beyond the cellular material
   structures and offering unique combinations of both auxetic and
   mechanical properties. However, the understanding and development of
   these promising material structures have been predominantly based on
   analytical evaluation methods, as practical implementation was
   restricted by manufacturing limitations. The manufacturing limitation
   has changed quite significantly with the advent of additive
   manufacturing methods, particularly with direct metal printing, such as
   selective laser melting. Ever since, the auxetic meta material
   structures began attracting renewed interests, and several different new
   structural forms and hybridisation of certain existing models followed,
   focussing specifically on enhancing auxeticity as well as other
   mechanical attributes. A recently developed and novel S-shaped unit cell
   based auxetic structure is hybridised with star re-entrant unit cells
   and analysed both numerically and experimentally based on physical forms
   produced by selective laser melting as part of the research reported
   here. Numerical and experimental results correlated sufficiently,
   depitcing significant enhanced auxeticity as high as -3, and mechanical
   property with the hybrid structures.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials (when stretched longitudinally,
   the thickness of these materials increases along the lateral direction)
   are widely used in engineering because of their good resistance to
   shear, denting, and fracture. Observance of a negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) in two-dimensional (2D) single-layer materials presently has two
   explanations. The first, from mechanical principles, is that it derives
   from the presence of a special structure (hinge structure), such as in
   single-layer black phosphorus (BP) or black arsenic (beta-As). The
   second, from electronic effects, is that it derives from
   (non-hinge-like) planar honeycomb structures and transition-metal
   dichalcogenides, MX2. Through first-principle calculations, we show that
   2D single-layer materials with a hinge structure also have distinct
   electronic effects, similar to those observed from 2D planar honeycomb
   materials. Under strain, electronic effects of Px orbitals lead to the
   inherent NPR of the 2D single-layer material with a hinge structure. We
   discuss the influencing factors of the hinge structure on the NPR and
   demonstrate that the electronic effects inside the hinge structure are
   the fundamental factor in determining the inherent NPR.}},

Abstract = {{Quasi-static behavior of a poroelastic circular cylinder subjected to
   constant strain-rate axial compression was analyzed within the framework
   of the continuum mechanics of fluid-saturated, linear, poroelastic
   materials. The solutions obtained in the Laplace space were numerically
   inversed into the time domain. The results were illustrated in the form
   of curves for a wide range of drained Poisson's ratio (from positive to
   negative). It was found that, although the axial strain increases
   linearly with respect to time, all other strains, pore fluid pressure
   and all stresses do not; especially, in the case of the negative
   Poisson's ratio, the tangential strain becomes tensile immediately after
   loading and reverses its sign after a while; thereafter the compressive
   strain grows up to infinity. The pore fluid pressure and the tangential
   stress approach a steady state (constant) value after experiencing their
   transient process. Apparent stress-strain curves are nonlinear due to
   the pore fluid diffusion, with the more nonlinear for the smaller
   Poisson's ratio, especially for the negative ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the identification of the shear modulus of open cell
   polyurethane thermoformed auxetic foams from 3- and 4-point bending
   tests. The foams are incorporated in sandwich beams with carbon
   fibre/epoxy face skins, and benchmarked against similar sandwich
   structures made with the conventional counterpart open cell foam. Three
   types of beams are tested: one with auxetic foams, another type related
   to a conventional foam core with the same thickness of the auxetic
   porous materials, and a third type of beam consisting in conventional
   foam with a thickness corresponding to an iso-weight configuration to
   the auxetic specimen. The auxetic foam has a shear modulus 7\% lower
   than the one of the bulk conventional specimens, but higher shear
   stresses at large deformations and a smoother strain stiffening response
   compared to the beams with the conventional thinner core. The paper also
   highlights the low shear wave speed of these auxetic foams compared to
   other porous polymers used in helmet and head protection applications,
   as well as potential uses of the quasi-zero-stiffness behavior here
   observed for the auxetic foam sandwich beam.}},

Title = {{Multifunctional Polymer-Based Graphene Foams with Buckled Structure and
   Negative Poisson's Ratio}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 9}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we report the polymer-based graphene foams through
   combination of bottom-up assembly and simple triaxially buckled
   structure design. The resulting polymer-based graphene foams not only
   effectively transfer the functional properties of graphene, but also
   exhibit novel negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) behaviors due to the
   presence of buckled structure. Our results show that after the
   introduction of buckled structure, improvement in stretchability,
   toughness, flexibility, energy absorbing ability, hydrophobicity,
   conductivity, piezoresistive sensitivity and crack resistance could be
   achieved simultaneously. The combination of mechanical properties,
   multifunctional performance and unusual deformation behavior would lead
   to the use of our polymer-based graphene foams for a variety of novel
   applications in future such as stretchable capacitors or conductors,
   sensors and oil/water separators and so on.}},

Title = {{Mechanical properties of hybrid metamaterial with auxetic chiral
   cellular structure and silicon filler}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{234}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid metamaterial with auxetic cellular structure and silicon filler
   was manufactured and mechanically tested for the first time with aim to
   study its enhanced mechanical properties. The uniform and graded base
   specimens with auxetic chiral cellular structure were fabricated from
   copper alloy using the Selective Electron Beam Melting (SEBM) method.
   The fabricated specimens were then fully infiltrated with silicone
   filler under vacuum conditions to avoid any voids (air gaps) and to
   achieve a high degree of homogeneity in the composite structure. The
   mechanical behaviour of hybrid specimens under quasi-static and dynamic
   compressive loading conditions was investigated experimentally. The
   results show that hybrid specimens with auxetic cellular structure and
   silicon filler exhibit much better mechanical response with increased
   stiffness and smooth response in comparison to specimens with
   conventional (non-hybrid) auxetic cellular structure. They also have a
   higher plateau stress but lower densification strain and possess much
   higher energy absorption capacity in comparison to the base specimens
   with chiral auxetic structure. This is attributed to the interaction
   between the filler and the structure, which results in the improvement
   of the macroscopic mechanical properties.}},

   Coupling in Compressible Circular Tubes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELASTICITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{175-201}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We present effects of intrinsic twist and material orthotropy on
   extension-twist-inflation coupling in circular tubes about their
   stress-free state. Simple analytical expressions for coupling
   stiffnesses corresponding to extension-twist, twist-inflation and
   extension-inflation couplings are obtained. We show that the sign of the
   extension-twist coupling stiffness, which governs initial
   overwinding/unwinding in tubes during their extension, is not just
   dependent on the tube's intrinsic twist but also on two other
   parameters: ratio of the Young's moduli in the lateral surface of
   orthotropic tube and the excess of the Poisson's ratio from an isotropy
   condition. By tuning these two parameters, one can generate the
   counter-intuitive overwinding as reported earlier in the case of DNA.
   Similarly, we show that even with positive Poisson's ratio, an
   intrinsically twisted tube could inflate on being stretched. We also
   present a scheme to obtain all the relevant stiffnesses of chiral
   single-walled carbon nanotubes from a ``one-atom unit cell{''}
   calculation. These stiffnesses, when plotted vs. the nanotube's
   chirality, exhibit interesting periodicity which has its origin in the
   6-fold symmetry of graphene. This trend is captured in the continuum
   model for a nanotube when it is assumed to be comprised of three
   families of parallel fibers on its lateral surface.}},

Title = {{Numerical and experimental investigation of FDM fabricated re-entrant
   auxetic structures of ABS and PLA materials under compressive loading}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{223-244}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Auxetic structures are one type of mechanical meta-materials
   mainly used for energy absorption applications because of their unique
   negative Poisson's ratio. This study is focused on numerical and
   experimental investigations of fused deposition modeling (FDM)
   fabricated re-entrant auxetic structures of acrylonitrile butadiene
   styrene (ABS) and poly-lactic acid (PLA) materials under compressive
   loading. Influence of geometric parameters, namely, re-entrant angle,
   height and arm-length on strength, stiffness and specific energy
   absorption (SEA) of auxetic structures under compressive loading.
   Optimization of significant parameters is also performed to maximize
   these responses and minimize weight and time of fabrication. Further,
   efforts have also been made to develop predictive models for strength,
   stiffness and SEA of auxetic structures.
   Design/methodology/approach - A full factorial design of experiment is
   used for planning experiments. Auxetic structures of ABS and PLA are
   fabricated by FDM technique of additive manufacturing within the
   constrained range of geometric parameters. Analysis of variance is
   performed to identify the influence of geometric parameters on
   responses. To optimize the geometric parameters Gray relational analysis
   is used. Deformation of auxetic structures is studied under compressive
   loading. A numerical investigation is also performed by building
   nonlinear finite element models of auxetic structures.
   Findings - From the analysis of results, it is found that re-entrant
   angle, height and arm-length with their interactions are significant
   parameters influencing responses, namely, strength, stiffness and SEA of
   the auxetic structures of ABS and PLA materials. Based on the analysis,
   statistical nonlinear quadratic models are developed to predict these
   responses. Optimal configurations of auxetic structure of ABS and PLA
   are determined to maximize strength, stiffness, SEA and minimize weight
   and time of fabrication. From the study of deformation of auxetic
   structures, it is found that ABS structures have higher energy
   absorption, whereas PLA structures have better stiffness. Results of
   finite element analysis (FEA) are found in good agreement with
   experimental results.
   Research limitations/implications - The present study is limited to
   re-entrant type of auxetic structures of ABS and PLA materials only
   under compressive loading. Also, results from the present study are
   valid within the selected range of geometric parameters. The findings of
   the present study are useful in maximizing strength, stiffness and SEA
   of auxetic structures that have wide applications in the automotive,
   aerospace, sports and marine sector.
   Originality/value - No literature is available on studying the influence
   of geometric parameters, namely, re-entrant angle, height and arm-length
   of auxetic structure on strength, stiffness and SEA under compressive
   loading. Also, a comparative study of feedstock materials, namely, ABS
   and PLA, is also not reported. The present work attempts to fulfill the
   above research gaps.}},

Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Computer simulations using Monte Carlo method in the isobaric-isothermal
   ensemble were used to investigate the impact of nanoinclusions in the
   form of very narrow channels in the {[}111]-direction on elastic
   properties of crystals, whose particles interact via Yukawa potential.
   The studies were performed for several selected values of Debye
   screening length ((kappa sigma)(-1)). It has been observed that
   introduction of the nanoinclusions into the system reduces the negative
   value of Poisson's ratio towards {[}110]{[}1 (1) over bar0], maintaining
   practically constant values of Poisson's ratio in the directions {[}100]
   and {[}111]. These studies also show that concentration of particles
   forming the nanoinclusions in the system has a significant effect on the
   value of Poisson's ratio in the {[}110]{[}1 (1) over bar0]-direction. A
   strong (more than fourfold) decrease of Poisson's ratio in this
   direction was observed, from 0.147 (3) (system without inclusions) to
   0.614 (14) (system with nanoinclusions) at kappa sigma = 10 when the
   inclusion particles constituted about 10 percent of all particles. The
   research also showed an increase in the degree of auxeticity in the
   system with increasing concentration of nanoinclusion particles for all
   the screening lengths considered.}},

   solutions with compositions near the morphotropic phase boundary and
   poled along the perovskite unit-cell {[}011] direction (mm (2) symmetry
   of domain-engineered SCs). The orientation of the main crystallographic
   axes in the single-crystal component is observed to strongly influence
   the piezoelectric coefficients , squared figures of merit ,
   electromechanical coupling factors , and hydrostatic analogs of these
   parameters of the 2-2 composite. Inequalities and (f = 1 and 2) are
   achieved at specific orientations of the main crystallographic axes due
   to the significant anisotropy of the elastic and piezoelectric
   properties of the single-crystal component. The use of an auxetic
   polyethylene (a polymer component with a negative Poisson's ratio) leads
   to a significant increase in the hydrostatic parameters. Particular
   advantages of such composites over conventional ceramic/polymer
   composites are taken into account for transducer, hydroacoustic, energy
   harvesting, and other applications.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional model involving rotation and distortion of
   corner-linked parallelogram units is presented and investigated as a
   means of producing negative Poisson's ratios. It is then shown how the
   model can represent the behaviour of certain zeolite materials: by
   introducing structural parameters from the crystal structures of five
   zeolites with the NAT-type structure, it is shown that the model
   replicates their elastic behaviour well and depends on a balance between
   the rotation of the parallelogram units and their distortion (by change
   of edge lengths and internal angle), which is dictated by the direction
   of applied stress. In the case of one of the materials, natrolite, the
   predicted values of Poisson's ratios agree well with those derived from
   experiment, and it is suggested that the model might be used to search
   for negative Poisson's ratios in other inorganic structures. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{We analyze in this contribution the impact of wave damping-on the
   dispersion features of 3D viscoelastic periodic structures, which are
   modeled as Kelvin Voigt viscoelastic beam-lattices. The band diagram
   structure and damping ratio are computed for different repetitive
   structures, based on the micropolar viscoelastic response of the
   effective medium obtained by the homogenization of the initially
   discrete lattice architecture. The employed methodology is herewith
   exemplified for the cases of the 3D hexagon structure, which shows
   negative Poisson's ratio for reentrant configurations, and the 2D plain
   weave textile structure. The dispersion relations and damping ratio are
   obtained by inserting an harmonic plane waves Ansatz into the dynamical
   equations of motion of the obtained effective viscoelastic anisotropic
   continuum. The 3D reentrant hexagon is an auxetic metamaterial showing
   excellent wave absorption capabilities, as reflected by the high
   incidence of partial band gaps. The textile plain weave structure shows
   a complete band gap for low frequencies. Comparing the frequency band
   structure of the effective continuum with that obtained by Floquet Bloch
   analysis extended to a 3D context shows that the wave propagation
   characteristics can be directly obtained from the homogenized continuum
   at low frequencies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work illustrates the manufacturing and tensile testing of a novel
   concept of honeycomb structures with hexagonal and auxetic (negative
   Poisson's ratio) topology, made of shape memory alloy (SMA) core
   material. The honeycombs are manufactured using Nitinol ribbons having
   6.40 mm of width and 0.2 mm of thickness. The ribbons were inserted in a
   special dye using cyanoacrilate to bond the longitudinal strips of the
   unit cells. The ribbons were subjected to tensile test at room
   temperature (martensite finish) and austenite finish temperature.
   Tensile tests at room temperature were performed on the honeycomb. The
   stress-strain curve obtained from the test on a single ribbon at room
   temperature was then used to develop nonlinear Finite Element beam
   elements using a commercial code. The beam elements were then used to
   model the honeycomb samples under tensile loading. Good agreement is
   observed between numerical nonlinear simulations and the experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the effect of different Poisson's ratios and an
   equivalent Poisson's ratio formula on the crack initiation angle and
   life estimation by using the three shear-strain based fatigue damage
   models (Brown-Miller, Fatemi-Socie, and Liu's Virtual Energy) on
   strain-controlled biaxial cyclic loading tests of specific tubular
   material specimens. The four shear failure mode materials studied were
   Inconel 718, 304L stainless steel, normalized 1050, and
   quenched/tempered 1050 steels. This study was motivated by the fact that
   for all the strain-controlled fatigue testing, the induced transverse
   strain was not measured, but assumed to be a negative product of the
   axial strain and the Poisson ratio, where the axial strain was known and
   given, and the Poisson ratio was either assumed to be a constant or a
   variable represented by a function of elastic and plastic equivalent
   strains. Therefore, the assumption of a Poisson's ratio in the
   transverse strain calculation was assessed in this study. It is
   concluded that the use of different Poisson's ratios in the three
   fatigue damage models would have some effects on the crack angle
   prediction, depending on the material type, and little effect on the
   fatigue life estimation for all materials investigated in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Honeycomb structures are widely used in structural applications because

   (FEM) technique developed for the analysis of spatial ly periodic
   materials is applied for the analysis of linear elastic responses of the
   regular and re-entrant honeycomb structures. Young's modulus of the
   regular honeycomb increased with volume fraction. Poisson's ratio of the
   regular honeycomb structure decreased from unity as volume fraction
   increased. The re-entrant honeycomb structure had a negative Poisson's
   ratio, its value dependent upon the inverted angle of cell ribs. Young's
   modulus of the re-entrant honeycomb structure decreased as the inverted
   angle of cell ribs increased. The results are in good agreement with
   previous analytical results. This homogenization theory is also
   applicable to three-dimensional foam materials-conventional and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{199}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies the fatigue behavior of auxetic honeycomb
   layer/substrate structures due to interfacial delamination damage.
   First, the interfacial thermal stress and cyclic interfacial thermal
   stress intensity factor (ITSIF) at the free ends of the structure are
   determined in terms of the thermal shock time, relative density, aspect
   ratio, and internal cell angle of the honeycomb. Then, a theoretical
   model for the service life analysis of the structures is established
   based on Paris?s law. The results show that the auxetic structures have
   a lower ITSIF level and a longer service life compared with those of the
   non-auxetic structures. Another interesting finding is that a reduction
   in the relative density of the honeycomb layer will increase the service
   life of the structures. This confirms the significance of applying
   auxetic materials in re-usable structures for thermal protection
   purposes. This research is the first attempt to evaluate the service
   life of the auxetic honeycomb layer/substrate structures under thermal

Title = {{Tunable digital material properties for 3D voxel printers}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{241-247}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Digital materials are composed of many discrete voxels placed
   in a massively parallel layer deposition process, as opposed to
   continuous (analog) deposition techniques. The purpose of this paper is
   to explore the wide range of material properties attainable using a
   voxel-based freeform fabrication process, and demonstrate in simulation
   the versatility of fabricating with multiple materials in this manner.
   Design/methodology/approach - A representative interlocking voxel
   geometry was selected, and a nonlinear physics simulator was implemented
   to perform virtual tensile tests on blocks of assembled voxels of
   varying materials. Surface contact between tiles, plastic deformation of
   the individual voxels, and varying manufacturing precision were all
   modeled.
   Findings - By varying the precision, geometry, and material of the
   individual voxels, continuous control over the density, elastic modulus,
   coefficient of thermal expansion, ductility, and failure mode of the
   material is obtained. Also, the effects of several hierarchical voxel
   ``microstructures{''} are demonstrated, resulting in interesting
   properties such as negative Poisson's ratio.
   Research limitations/implications - This analysis is a case study of a
   specific voxel geometry, which is representative of 2.5D interlocking
   shapes but not necessarily all types of interlocking voxels.
   Practical implications - The results imply that digital materials can
   exhibit widely varying and tunable properties in a single desktop
   fabrication process.
   Originality/value - The paper explores the vast potential of tunable
   materials, especially using the concept of voxel microstructure,
   applicable primarily to 3D voxel printers but also to other
   multi-material freeform fabrication processes.}},

Title = {{Optimizing the Auxetic Geometry Parameters in Few Yarns Based Auxetic
   Woven Fabrics for Enhanced Mechanical Properties Using Grey Relational
   Analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL FIBERS}},
Abstract = {{2D woven auxetic fabrics (AF) developed by weave design modification
   provide a continuous, commercial, and low-cost manufacturing process for
   high strength and stable auxetic structures. However, AFs developed by
   previous methods have a highly folded surface, which is problematic in
   printing, laminating, and stitching. For the first time, we studied the
   auxeticity in a few yarn-based auxetic structures, which provides a
   uniform surface texture. Reentrant honey-comb geometry was chosen to
   fabricate auxetic woven fabrics, as such geometry shows the best auxetic
   nature. Different parameters of auxetic geometry were optimized based on
   their mechanical response using the statistical tool: gray relational
   analysis (GRA). The mechanical properties of AFs were compared with
   conventional (3/1 twill woven) non-auxetic fabric (NAF), having the same
   specifications. The smaller unit cell (3E) with a reorientation area of
   4P showed optimum auxeticity and mechanical properties. The optimized
   auxetic structure showed superior mechanical properties as compared to
   conventional fabric. GRA grade of optimized AF was 67.3\% higher than
   the NAF. Most importantly, the tensile strength was 23\% higher for
   optimized AF structure. The bidimensional energy dissipation ability of
   the AF provides a key advantage in the superior mechanical response.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{254}},

Abstract = {{The present paper concerns two methods: IMD (isotropic material design)
   and YMD (Young modulus material design) concerning Pareto optimal
   distributions of the material and its isotropic properties. The merit
   function is the weighted sum of compliances corresponding to n
   independent loading conditions. The unit cost of the design is assumed
   as equal to the trace of the elastic moduli tensor C. In the IMD method,
   the design variables are the bulk and shear moduli. In the YMD method,
   the Poisson ratio is assumed as given, possibly non-uniformly
   distributed in the design domain, the Young modulus being the only
   design variable. Both the methods reduce to the auxiliary minimization
   problem involving statically admissible stress fields corresponding to
   the subsequent loading conditions. The integrand is expressed by a norm
   of the collection of these stresses, hence has linear growth. The
   numerical method proposed refers to the primal formulation: it is based
   on piece-wise polynomial approximation of the set of statically
   admissible stresses. The exemplary Pareto optimal solutions show that
   admitting negative values of Poisson's ratio may contribute to a
   decrease of the total compliances.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this work is i) to synthesize a metamaterial with
   three-dimensional (3D) micro-architecture for variable stiffness and
   multiple Poisson's ratios in different directions, using cylindrical
   holes and slits in the 3D structural material and ii) to analyze its
   structural behavior. For the materials design, we use a hybrid synthesis
   method with Compliant Porous Structures (CPSes), producing positive and
   negative Poisson's ratios in the 3D space. Internal contact of slit
   surface of CPS under both tensile and compressive loadings is used for
   the variable stiffness design. We build a constitutive model of the
   metamaterial with CPS, verifying it with finite element (FE) based
   simulations and experimental tests. We apply a hierarchical design
   approach for lattice structures to explore the effect of tessellation of
   CPS on the mechanical properties of metamaterials. The spatial
   arrangement of cylindrical holes and slits can be used for the
   intelligent design of metamaterials having engineered properties,
   together with an edge-based hierarchical design of lattice materials. We
   also provide a design guideline of a cubic lattice structure on its

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{141}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The quasi-static and high strain rate response of chiral auxetic
   cellular structures were evaluated in this work. Samples of the chiral
   auxetic structures were fabricated with the Selective Electron Beam
   Melting (SEBM) technique from copper powder. Uniaxial quasi-static and
   low-speed dynamic compression tests were performed on a universal
   testing machine, while high strain rate tests up to 5000 s(-1) were
   performed using the one-stage powder gun. The experimental measurements
   together with infrared thermography and high-speed camera images were
   used to study the deformation mechanism of chiral auxetic structures. A
   significant effect of the shock enhancement observed in experiments at
   higher loading velocities was characterised by evaluating the specific
   energy absorption and specific strength. This phenomenon was further
   analysed in more detail by using parametric computational simulations,
   which offered more detailed analysis of mechanical behaviour at
   different strain rates. The computational results indicate that the
   plateau stress of chiral auxetic structure increases exponentially with
   increasing loading velocity. An empirical polynomial approximation was
   extracted from the computational results, which enables estimation of
   the plateau stress of auxetic cellular structures at arbitrary loading
   velocity in between the analyses velocity limits.}},

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{163}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This work describes the low-velocity impact behavior of composite
   sandwich panels with different types of auxetic (negative Poisson?s
   ratio) and non-auxetic prismatic core structures. Sandwich panels have
   been manufactured with carbon/fiber epoxy composite face sheets,
   polyurethane rigid foam core or 3D printed PLA plastic cellular
   honeycombs head (hexagonal, re-entrant, hexachiral and arrowhead). The
   material properties of the constituents have been determined via tensile
   and compression tests. The cellular core topologies have the same wall
   thickness and number of cells (39x4, except for the hexachiral
   topology). A rigid striker with a hemispherical head tip is dropped on
   the specimens with a speed of 2.6 m/s. Explicit finite element (FE)
   models are validated by the experimental results. Parametric numerical
   analyses using the validated FE have been carried out with different
   impact energies of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 76 J to identify the best
   core designs. The results show that non-auxetic cores could have
   advantages over the auxetic ones at small deformation (impact energy is
   equal to 10 J) thanks to the larger contact surface and higher thickness
   of the cellular structure. The auxetic core, however, provides greater
   impact resistance and energy absorption capability as the impact energy
   increases due to the larger densification and lower indentation during
   collapse. The arrowhead-based panels in particular possess 25\%, 13\%
   and 11\% larger crash efficiency than the other samples for impacts with
   50, 60 and 76 J. The hexachiral lattice provides the best performance at
   10, 20 and 30 J, and also possesses advantages over the other cellular
   configurations (except for the arrowhead core) in the case of 40, 50, 60
   and 76 J impact loading. As a result, the arrowhead and hexachiral
   configurations are those mostly recommended for applications involving
   impacts under large deformations.}},

Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{494-505}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental investigation of the dynamic
   thermo-mechanical and impact properties of helical auxetic yarns (HAYs).
   A series of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) core fibres fabricated
   using an extrusion process have been wrapped with either
   ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) wrap or stainless
   steel wire wrap to form helical auxetic yarns. Dynamic mechanical
   analysis (DMA) measurements indicated that the core/wrap diameter ratio
   and the initial wrap angle influenced significantly the dynamic
   thermo-mechanical behaviour of HAYs. The impact test results have shown
   that the fibre property, impact velocity and the initial wrap angle had
   great effect on the impact response of a HAY. Importantly, in this work

   the maximum elastic deformation of a unit volume along the support line

   under a pressure corresponding to an indoors deflagration explosion of a

Abstract = {{One method for producing synthetic auxetic materials is starting with
   polymer powders and using a combination of compaction, sintering, and
   extrusion. This article presents a novel variation on this route,
   omitting the extrusion stage and generating the required microstructure
   by compaction followed by multiple sintering. The effects of single,
   double, and quadruple sintering on compacted cylinders are examined in
   terms of a detailed microstructural examination, study of density and
   dimensional variations, and measurement of Poisson's ratio. The best
   results were obtained by compaction followed by double sintering,
   resulting in a strain dependent Poisson's ratio as low as v = -0.32.
   This new technique has great potential for increasing the range of
   geometries that can be fabricated and is very akin to ceramic sintering
   techniques. (c) 2005 Society of Plastics Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter lays down the foundation for elastic stability of columns,
   circular plates, rectangular plates, cylindrical shells and spherical
   shells that possess negative Poisson's ratio. Results show that the
   plate Poisson's ratio has no effect on the elastic stability of
   rectangular plates under in-plane biaxial loadings when the critical
   buckling load is expressed in terms of plate flexural rigidity, but the
   Poisson's ratio plays a greater role for circular plate buckling. In the
   elastic stability study of spherical shells, the critical buckling
   stress is directly proportional to the shell thickness for Poisson's
   ratio of 0 and proportional to the square of the shell thickness as the
   Poisson's ratio approaches -1. Thereafter a summary of results by Miller
   et al. (Compos Sci Technol 70:1049-1056, 2010) for flatwise buckling
   optimization of hexachiral and tetrachiral honeycombs is furnished.
   Finally examples are given for square plates with array of perforations
   such that imposition of uniaxial compressive buckling leads to 2D

Abstract = {{Using evolutionary structure search combined with ab initio theory, we
   investigate the electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties of
   two-dimensional (2D) A(2)B (A = Cu, Ag, Au, and B = S, Se) auxetic
   semiconductors. Two types of structures are found to have low energy,
   namely, s(I/II)-A(2)B, which have direct bandgaps in the range 1.09-2.60
   eV and high electron mobilities. Among these semiconductors, Cu2B and
   Ag2B have light holes with 2 orders of magnitude larger mobility than
   the heavy holes, up to 9.51 X 10(4)cm(2) v(-1) s(-1) , giving the
   possibility of achieving highly anisotropic hole transport with the
   application of a uniaxial strain. Due to the ionic bonding nature,
   s-A(2)B structures have unusually low lattice thermal conductivities
   down to 1.5 W m(-1) K-1 at 300 K, which are quite promising for new
   generation thermoelectric devices. Besides, s-A(2)B structures show
   extraordinary flexibility with ultralow Young's moduli (down to 20 N/m),
   which are lower than most previously reported 2D materials. Moreover,
   under strain along the diagonal direction, five of the structures have
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Equations for solving the deflection and bending moments of rhombic
   plates by exact method are known to be highly tedious. A set of
   simplified equations is developed for design purposes of such simply
   supported plates under uniform load. Curve-fitting from exact data
   allows the deflection and its second derivatives, evaluated at the plate
   centre, to be expressed in greatly simplified and yet sufficiently
   accurate empirical models for thin rhombic plates. Using the simplified
   model, it is shown that the maximum bending moment can be reduced by
   using auxetic materials. By including the effects of shear deformation
   for thick rhombic plates, it is demonstrated that the ratio of
   shear-to-bending deformation decreases as the rhombic plate approaches a
   square shape and as the plate's Poisson's ratio becomes more negative.}},

Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the effect of unit cell configuration on the
   energy absorption response of different cellular auxetic structures
   subjected to quasi-static and dynamic loadings through the experimental
   and numerical methods. Among the various structures, a re-entrant
   structure was selected due to its fundamental properties underlying the
   main characteristics of an auxetic material. Computer simulation
   techniques using ABAQUS software validated by experimental testing were
   used to conduct the evaluation of such devices. Several re-entrant
   structures with different geometrical parameters were modeled and
   compared with the conventional ones. Standard compression tests were
   carried out on the different structures produced by the 3D printing
   machine to evaluate the influence of auxeticity phenomenon in the energy
   absorption capability. It is discovered that the auxetic structures are
   superior to non-auxetic structures in terms of all studied impact
   resistance and energy absorption indicators due to their ability to
   withstand quasi-static axial impact loads. The primary outcome of this
   research is to extract design information for the use of auxetic
   materials as energy absorbers where quasi-static loading is expected.}},

Abstract = {{The morphology-and deformation behaviour of a liquid crystalline
   polymer, consisting of both, laterally attached transverse rods and
   terminally attached rods were studied. A plaque specimen of the polymer
   was prepared using the melt-compression method, which exhibited highly
   anisotropic Poisson's ratio behaviour. In its through-thickness
   direction its Poisson's ratio was approximately 0.54, and in the
   in-plane it was approximately 0.43. This anisotropic behaviour is
   explained by the anisotropic morphology of the polymer plaque resulting
   from its compression preparation. The high Poisson's ratio in the
   through-thickness direction is due to the unusual chain structure of the
   polymer. A simple analytical model is presented to describe the
   nonlinear strain dependent Poisson's ratio behaviour of the material.}},

   element with auxetic characteristics is modeled to assess the

   within the system, the variation of the monofilament length during the
   uniform contraction and force generated during a uniaxial mode of
   actuation have been obtained. The distribution of the axial stress was
   determined along the length of the monofilament at various stages during
   the uniform contraction. The rate of contraction reaches a maximum,
   together with a minimum of the stress intensity when the equivalent

Abstract = {{This paper presents a tunable planar auxetic metamaterial (PAM) for
   controlling and filtering acoustic waves and provides guidelines for
   bandgap design of the proposed PAMs. Numerical results for deformed and
   undeformed PAMs were obtained from several finite element analyses based
   on Bloch-Floquet theory. The acoustic band structures of the PAMs were
   calculated with periodic boundaries. Tunable bandgaps in certain
   frequency ranges were generated by various deformations applied to the
   PAMs. Wave attenuation in experimental transmission loss at specific
   frequencies was demonstrated, showing favorable agreement with the
   bandgaps obtained from numerical calculations. Both the numerical and
   experimental results indicate that the proposed structure demonstrates
   great tunability and offers significant advantages over the regular
   materials for controlling sound wave propagation and filtering sound
   waves within specific frequency ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Microorganism metabolic activity can facilitate the formation of
   cellular material systems that have unusual mechanical and physical
   properties. In the living world microorganisms are commonly used for
   preparing porous food by fermentation; here carbon nanotubes, graphene
   nanoplatelets, and a mix of them are dispersed in liquid silicone rubber
   with single-cell fungi of commercial beer yeast. The fermentation of
   such microorganisms during the gelling of the silicone matrix results in
   bionic composites with buckled/collapsed cells that infer, as
   rationalized with an analytical model and excluded in a abiotic
   experimental comparison, auxetic properties. During stretching it is
   found that the Poisson's ratio of such composites changes sign, from
   negative to positive, and the variation of the electrical resistance is
   negative. In addition to the conductivity increment, a general increment
   of the stretchability and damage resistance with respect to the
   composites prepared by abiotic process is observed. Bionic composites,
   even if in their infancy, can thus be multifunctional and superior to
   their traditional/abiotic counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Auxeticity (i.e., negative Poisson's ratios) is associated with
   particular geometrical features and deformation mechanisms occuring
   within a system. Among the models which have been shown to exhibit such
   behaviour are the `rotating rigid unit' models, in particular
   two-dimensional systems constructed from connected squares. In this work
   we consider such a system which deforms through simultaneous stretching
   and rotation of the squares. We derive the analytical model describing
   its mechanical behaviour to show that the mechanical properties depend
   on the relative magnitude of the stretching and hinging constants, the
   square dimensions and the angle between the squares. In particular we
   show that the mechanical properties of the combined model are dependent
   on the relative contribution of the individual mechanisms and that by
   changing the relative magnitude of the force constants and/or the
   geometric parameters describing the system, the contribution from each
   of the two mechanisms and thus the Poisson's ratio, can be set to
   predesired values. (C) 2009 WILE-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of artery stent are of key importance to the
   mechanical integrity and biomechanical performance reliability of
   stent-plaque-artery system. In this paper, making use of auxetic
   deformation features of chiral structures and mechanical benefits of
   structural hierarchy, two types of innovative chiral stents with auxetic
   properties are proposed: (a) anti-tetrachiral stent with circular and
   elliptical nodes; (b) hierarchical antitetrachiral stents with circular
   and elliptical nodes. Firstly, the in-plane mechanical properties of
   anti-tetrachiral structures are investigated theoretically, and uniaxial
   tensile experiments are performed for verification; Secondly, design
   procedures of anti-tetrachiral stent and hierarchical anti-tetrachiral
   stent with circular and elliptical nodes are elaborated. Effects of
   stent geometrical parameters on the tensile mechanical behaviors of
   these stents are studied with finite element analysis (FEA). It is found
   that the mechanical behaviors of antitetrachiral stent can be tailored
   through adjusting the levels of hierarchical structures and unit cell
   design parameters. Finally, the deformation of anti-tetrachiral and
   hierarchical anti-tetrachiral stents during stenting process are
   investigated with FEA. It is found that the proposed anti-tetrachiral
   and hierarchical anti-tetrachiral stents exhibit remarkable radial
   expanding abilities while maintaining axial stability, thus show
   promising performances for practical clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates the compressive property of a novel composite
   based on a weft-knitted auxetic tube subjected to a quasi-static
   compression test. In order to maximize the influence of the fiber
   content on the compression test, a Kevlar yarn was used in knitting the
   tubular samples using three different auxetic arrow-head structures
   (i.e. 4 x 4, 6 x 6 and 8 x 8 structure). A quasi-static compression test
   was conducted under two different impact loading speeds (i. e. 5 mm/min
   and 15 mm/min loading speed). The results indicate that the energy
   absorption (EA) property of the auxetic composite is highly influenced
   by the auxeticity of the knitted tubular fabric.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific investigations of structures characterised by auxetic
   properties conducted so far have led to analyses on a molecular and
   macroscopic scale and few studies have been concerned with descriptions
   of auxetic models which could find application in objects of everyday
   use. The aim of this paper was to carry out numerical modelling and
   physical verification of furniture seat quality made up of auxetic
   pressure springs. The authors decided to determine system stiffness and
   distribution of contact pressure on their surface. The performed
   detailed numerical analysis made it possible to evaluate the comfort of
   seat utilisation as well as to assess the impact of seat modification
   with NHE35 foam on changes of this comfort. In addition, it was
   demonstrated that numerical modelling may provide a useful tool for
   rapid prototyping of complex, multilayer systems manufactured from
   materials with non-linear characteristics. Results of numerical
   calculations were verified in the laboratory determining the scale of
   errors with which these results should be interpreted. (c) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Auxetic mechanical metamaterials, which expand transversally when
   axially stretched, are widely used in flexible electronics and
   aerospace. However, these chiral metamaterials suffer from three severe
   limitations as a typical auxetic metamaterials: narrow strain range,
   non-tunable mechanical behaviors, and fixed properties after
   fabrication. In this work, 4D printing chiral metamaterials with
   tunable, programmable, and reconfigurable properties are developed. The
   deformation mode transforms from bending dominated to stretching
   dominated under large deformation, leading to the stress-deformation
   (sigma-lambda) behavior of the auxetic metamaterials similar to those of
   the biomaterials ({''}J{''}-shaped), such as tissues or organs. The
   programmability and reconfigurability of the developed chiral
   metamaterials allow mechanical behavior to change between different
   biomaterials with high precision. Furthermore, scaffolds with
   personalized mechanical properties as well as configurations and
   metamaterials-based light-emitting diode integrated devices demonstrate
   potential applications in tissue engineering and programmable flexible
   electronics.}},

Abstract = {{.This paper investigates the nonlinear dynamic response of sandwich
   beams with functionally graded (FG) negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   honeycomb core in thermal environments. The novel constructions of
   sandwich beams with four FG configurations of re-entrant honeycomb cores
   through the beam thickness direction are proposed for the first time.
   The temperature-dependent material properties of both face sheets and
   core of the sandwich beam are considered. 3D full scale finite element
   analyses are conducted to investigate the nonlinear dynamic response,
   and the variation of effective Poisson's ratio (EPR) of the sandwich
   beam in the large deflection region. The numerical simulations are
   carried out for the sandwich beam with FG-NPR honeycomb core, from which
   results for the same sandwich beam with uniform distributed NPR
   honeycomb core are obtained as a comparator. Present results indicate
   that, when subjected to transverse dynamic pressure, the induced dynamic
   bending moment of the sandwich beam with core of positive EPR is much
   bigger than that of the sandwich beam with NPR core, and the thickness
   of which will extraordinarily increase. The effects of loading types,
   functionally graded configurations, temperature changes, boundary
   conditions, and length-to-thickness ratios on the deflection-time curves
   and EPR-deflection curves of sandwich beams are discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{The understanding of wave propagation in a metamaterial with
   hierarchical, auxetic rectangular perforations is presented in this
   work. The metamaterial is a 2D structure with chaining horizontal and
   vertical perforations exhibing auxetic in-plane behaviour. The unit cell
   of this lattice is identified as the reference level 0. Hierarchical
   structures are composed of structural elements which themselves have
   structure. At level 0, 4 rigid squares are present in the unit cell. In
   each square, the reference structure is used by applying a scale ratio
   to obtain the level 1. The same strategy is used to reach the upper
   level in each subunit. A geometric parametric investigation of these
   rectangular perforations using a numerical asymptotic homogenisation
   finite element approach is done. Some numerical eigenvalue tools are
   used for the dispersion analysis of this structure. It is first observed
   that the total width of Band gaps increases with the hierarchy. The
   porosity induced by the perforations is taken into account in the
   mechanical properties. The symmetry of the geometry in the x-y plane
   allow to define the entire geometry of the unit cell using only 2
   parameters: the void aspect ratio, the intercell spacing and the
   hierarchy level. When decreasing the intercell spacing, the total width
   of Band gaps increases and the effective stiffness in x and y directions
   decrease, allowing for increased rotations of the rigid sqares, so
   auxetic behaviour is greater. Hierarchical levels shift from isotropic
   to orthotropic, hierarchical levels are always auxetic.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of pure polycrystalline BaTiO3 was carried out by means
   of Broadband Viscoelastic Spectroscopy (BVS) and Differential Scanning
   Calorimetry (DSC) above ambient temperature. A peak in mechanical loss
   has been observed near the Curie point 130 degrees C. The magnitude of
   the peak increases with thermal rate and decreases with frequency.
   Expressions for the peak magnitude have been derived based upon
   available models describing the first order phase transition. Mechanical
   anomalies were observed outside the vicinity of the phase transition.
   Transition temperature measured by BVS differed from that via DSC; the
   effect of stress on the ferroelastic transformation is a possible cause.
   Isothermal frequency scans revealed a hump in mechanical loss in the
   vicinity of the transition temperature below 1 Hz and a modulus decrease
   with decreasing frequency. Quasi-isothermal studies revealed a
   significant softening in bulk modulus and a transient negative Poisson's
   ratio during the tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Skeletal muscle tissue provides support and mobility of the
   musculoskeletal system. Numerical modeling of muscle tissue aids in
   understanding disease pathophysiology, however, the effectiveness is
   dependent on accurately accounting for various tissue phenomena. Muscle
   modeling is made difficult due to the multitude of constituents that
   contribute to elastic and viscous mechanisms. Often, deterministic
   single fiber or fiber bundle studies are undertaken to examine these
   contributions. However, examination of whole, intact and structurally
   altered tissue and comparison to findings at the myofibril scale can
   help elucidate tissue mechanics. Stress relaxation tests at 10\% strain
   were performed on 28 New Zealand White rabbit's tibialis anterior
   muscles for whole, intact muscle and sub-sectioned muscle samples.
   Additionally, to aid in examining viscous effects, sub groups were
   tested with and without a phosphate buffered saline bath. The
   steady-state elastic modulus was not significantly different between
   groups. Interestingly, sectioning did result in a negative Poisson's
   ratio following tensile loading. Additionally, sectioning resulted in
   altering the viscous tissue response as the time to reach steady-state
   was significantly faster than whole muscle samples (p < 0.05), as well
   as the linear relaxation rate from 0 to 0.1 (p < 0.01), 1 to 10 (p <
   0.05), and 10 to 100 s (p < 0.05). Bathing tissue resulted in a
   significantly greater amount of percent stress relaxation for whole
   muscle (p < 0.01). These findings provide new insight into the differing
   mechanical characteristics of whole and sectioned muscle tissue. (c)

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{The design and the combination of innovative metamaterials are
   attracting increasing interest in the scientific community because of
   their unique properties that go beyond the ones of natural materials. In
   particular, auxetic materials and phononic crystals are widely studied
   for their negative Poisson's ratio and their bandgap opening properties,
   respectively. In this work, auxeticity and phononic crystals bandgap
   properties are properly combined to obtain a single phase periodic
   structure with a tridimensional wide tunable bandgap. When an external
   tensile load is applied to the structure, the auxetic unit cells change
   their configurations by exploiting the negative Poisson's ratio and this
   results in the tuning, either hardening or softening, of the frequencies
   of the modes limiting the 3D bandgap. Moreover, the expansion of the
   unit cell in all the directions, due to the auxeticity property,
   guarantees a fully 3D bandgap tunability of the proposed structure.
   Numerical simulations and analytical models are proposed to prove the
   claimed properties. The first experimental evidence of the tunability of
   a wide 3D bandgap is then shown thanks to the fabrication of a prototype
   by means of additive manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{Kirigami and auxetic topologies are combined to design an innovative
   metamaterial-based substrate (MetaSub) for piezoelectric energy
   harvesters. The proposed MetaSub piezoelectric energy harvester (MPEH)
   contains both advantageous metamaterial properties of negative Poisson's
   ratio capability and enhanced planar stretchability. A computational
   parametric analysis is conducted to develop the optimum design for the
   MPEH to trap the maximum elastic energy. A finite element analysis (FEA)
   is employed to analytically and numerically validate the simulation
   model of the MPEH. Accordingly, two experimental results of conventional
   and auxetic strain energy harvesters are used to evaluate the power
   enhancement of the MPEH. The FEA results demonstrate the average power
   gained by the MPEH at a low level of frequency and strain excitation (10
   Hz and 150 mu epsilon) is 165 mu W which easily satisfies the minimum
   electric power amount required as a sensor node for self-powered
   wireless sensor networks. The harvested power output of the MPEH is 19.2
   times more than power output produced by an equivalent conventional
   harvester with a plain substrate (8.6 mu W). The performance of the MPEH
   is investigated at different combinations of both low and high
   excitation frequencies. The creative design of the MetaSub can
   significantly improve the productivity of strain-induced devices whose
   efficiency is dependent on their deformation performance such as
   vibration energy harvesters, wearable sensors, flexible actuators, and
   micro electromechanical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the unique deformation characteristics of auxetic materials
   (Poisson's ratio mu< 0), they have better shock resistance and energy
   absorption properties than traditional materials. Inspired by the
   concept of variable crosssection design, a newauxetic re-entrant
   honeycomb structure is designed in this study. The detailed design
   method of re-entrant honeycomb with variable cross-section (VCRH) is
   provided, and five VCRH structures with the same relative density and
   different cross-section change rates are proposed. The in-plane impact
   resistance and energy absorption abilities of VCRH under constant
   velocity are investigated by ABAQUS/EXPLICIT. The results show that the
   introduction of variable cross-section design can effectively improve
   the impact resistance and energy absorption abilities of auxetic
   re-entrant honeycombs. The VCRH structure has better Young's modulus,
   plateau stress, and specific energy absorption (SEA) than traditional
   re-entrant honeycomb (RH). The influence of microstructure parameters
   (such as cross-section change rate alpha) on the dynamic impact
   performance of VCRH is also studied. Results show that, with the
   increase in impact velocity and alpha, the plateau stress and SEA of
   VCRH increase. A positive correlation is also found between the energy
   absorption efficiency, impact load uniformity and a under both medium
   and high impact speeds. These results can provide a reference for
   designing improved auxetic re-entrant honeycomb structures.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{We consider the thermal expansion, change in sound velocity with
   pressure and temperature, and the Poisson ratio of lattices which have
   rigid units (polyhedra very large stiffness to change in bond-length and
   to bond-angle variations) connected to other such units through
   relatively compressible polyhedra. We show that in such a model, the
   potential energy for rotations of the rigid units can occur only as a
   function of the combination Theta(i) equivalent to {[}theta(i)-(del x
   u(i))/2], where theta(i) are the orthogonal rotation angles of the rigid
   unit i and u(i) is its displacement. Given such invariants in the theory
   of elasticity and the hierarchy of force constants of the model, a
   negative thermal-expansion coefficient as well as a decrease in the
   elastic constants of the solid with temperature and pressure is shown to
   follow. These are consistent with the observations.}},

Abstract = {{The Xing'an Mongolian Orogenic Belt (XMOB) and the northern margin of
   North China Craton (NCC) have undergone multistage tectonic
   superimposition and the tectonic evolution is extremely complicated. We
   collect the teleseismic data of 44 temporary broadband seismic stations
   deployed in the XMOB and the northern margin of NCC to calculate the P
   wave receiver functions. The crustal thickness and average crustal ratio
   as well as the Poisson's ratios beneath 33 stations are estimated using
   the H-kappa stacking method. The results show: (1) the crustal thickness
   of the study area ranges from 38.7 to 42.7 km, with an average thickness
   of 41.2 km. There is a great difference in crustal thickness on both
   sides of Solonker suture zone. The characteristics of crustal thickness
   support the geodynamic model that the Paleo-Asian Ocean subducted and
   closed at the Solonker suture zone. (2) The Poisson's ratios in the
   study area are low, ranging from 0.215 to 0.277, with an average value
   of 0.243, suggesting that the rock composition of the area is dominated
   by felsic-acid rocks. (3) There exists a negative correlation between
   the Poisson's ratio and the crustal thickness. Combined with the lower
   values of Poisson's ratio, we speculate that the delamination is the
   major mechanism in crustal extension and thinning in the study area.}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{A comprehensive experimental investigation was performed to study the
   dynamic compressive constitutive response of novel auxetic
   Kevlar((R))/epoxy laminated composites. Strain rate response was
   investigated using the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) test setup.
   Laminated composites were fabricated using the vacuum infusion process.
   Short Nylon fibers were flocked between the laminates with different
   flock densities and flock length. For obtaining dynamic force
   equilibrium in SHPB experiments, a copper pulse shaper was used to
   increase the rising time of incident pulse. To have a comparison, woven
   Kevlar((R))/epoxy composites were also characterized at similar strain
   rates. In addition, quasi-static tests were also performed on both woven
   and auxetic laminated composites for completeness of the study. For
   quasi-static loading conditions, auxetic composites showed higher peak
   strain and lower peak stress compared to woven composites. For
   non-flocked composites, both auxetic and woven composites showed rate
   dependency. Woven composites provided 353\% increase in peak stress when
   the strain rate increased from 1200 s(-1) (low) to 3300 s(-1) (high).
   However, in the same conditions, auxetic composites showed only 155\%
   increase in peak stress. For different flocking conditions, woven
   composites showed rate dependency for all strain rates, but auxetic
   composites demonstrated rate dependency only from low to medium strain
   rates. Both auxetic and woven composites experienced shear failure under
   quasi-static compression, where auxetic composites failed at higher
   shear angle of 37(degrees), but woven composites had a failure angle of
   30(degrees). For impact loads, under no flocking condition, woven
   composites did undergo severe edge failure at all strain rates, but
   auxetic composites showed a sign of edge failure only at high strain
   rates. With the flocking condition, auxetic composites had through
   thickness shear failure and woven composites experienced splitting and
   fibrillation of Kevlar((R)) fibers.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{252}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This work investigates the indentation resistance of the
   auxetic/non-auxetic honeycomb ceramics layer by combining a discrete
   numerical representation and a continuum analytical model. The
   indentation depth of honeycombs with varying cell-wall angle and
   cell-wall thickness are measured. The indentation depth of auxetic
   honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) is smaller than that of
   conventional ones in the premise of the same cell-wall thickness. But on
   the condition that the honeycombs possess the same relative density,
   there exists an inverse tendency. The corresponding mechanisms
   responsible for those trends are revealed. The stress intensity factor
   (SIF) is defined to characterize the stress singularity at the corner of
   the punch. The influence of NPR on the magnitudes of SIF is evaluated. A
   punch toughness concept is defined by a novel multi-scale method as the
   failure criterion of brittle honeycomb ceramics in indentation tests.
   The effects of NPR on the punch toughness of honeycombs are discussed.
   And the empirical formulas of punch toughness varying with the cell-wall
   thickness and the relative density are summarized. Finally, the NPR
   effects on the collinear punches problem are detected; the results show
   that the auxetic performance can significantly weaken the interaction
   between the punches.}},

   buckling likely appears as the reinforcing walls are designed in low
   thickness for superior auxeticy. In this paper, a novel narrow ribs
   enhanced auxetic honeycomb is designed by embedding rhombus into each
   cell of the normal re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb (NRHH). Analytical
   model is built to investigate the elastic behaviors of the new proposed
   honeycomb under uniaxial compression, in which the incremental method is
   firstly introduced for post-local-buckling analysis. Numerical
   simulations are carried out to verify the analytical results. It is
   interesting that bilinear elastic characteristic is found for the
   stress-strain and transverse strain-longitudinal strain curves of the
   new proposed honeycomb on account of the local budding. Parameters
   studies are performed and the new proposed honeycomb is proved to
   exhibit superior mechanical properties compared to other narrow-ribs
   enhanced honeycombs. Significantly, the incremental method brought
   forward in the present paper for the local buckling analysis can be
   popularized to other honeycombs enhanced with narrow-ribs. Thus, the
   bilinear elastic characteristic is a general feature for these
   honeycombs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Honeycombs with Various Cell-Wall Angles}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic honeycombs have proven to be an attractive advantage in actual
   engineering applications owing to their unique mechanical characteristic
   and better energy absorption ability. The in-plane dynamic crushing
   behaviors of the honeycombs with various cell-wall angles are studied by
   means of explicit dynamic finite element simulation. The influences of
   the cell-wall angle, the impact velocity, and the edge thickness on the
   macro/microdeformation behaviors, the plateau stresses, and the specific
   energy absorption of auxetic honeycombs are discussed in detail.
   Numerical results show, that except for the impact velocity and the edge
   thickness, the in-plane dynamic performances of auxetic honeycombs also
   rely on the cell-wall angle. The ``><{''}-mode local deformation bands
   form under low-ormoderate-velocity impacting, which results in lateral
   compression shrinkage and shows negative Poisson's ratio during the
   crushing. For the given impact velocity, the plateau stress at the
   proximal end and the energy-absorbed ability can be improved by
   increasing the negative cell angle, the relative density, the impact
   velocity, and the matrix material strength. When the microcell
   parameters are the constant, the plateau stresses are proportional to
   the square of impact velocity.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is concerned with mechanical behaviour characterisation of
   auxetic cellular structures built from inverted tetrapods. The auxetic
   cellular structures were fabricated from the Ti-6Al-4 V alloy powder
   using the selective electron-beam melting method (SEBM). The fabricated
   specimens were experimentally subjected to different loading conditions
   by varying the loading direction and velocity (strain rate). In
   addition, the influence of the porosity on the mechanical response and
   deformation behaviour was analysed based on experimental compression
   tests supported by infrared thermography. The experimental results show
   that the porosity and loading direction have a major influence on the
   mechanical response, while the strain rate influence is negligible at
   analysed strain rates. The experimental results were also used to
   validate the computational lattice model of analysed structures computed
   by the LS-DYNA finite element code. The experimental and computational
   results were in good agreement for most of analysed geometries and

Abstract = {{Metamaterials with artificially designed architectures are increasingly
   considered as new paradigmatic material systems with unusual physical
   properties. Here, we report a class of architected lattice metamaterials
   with mechanically tunable negative Poisson's ratios and
   vibration-mitigation capability. The proposed lattice metamaterials are
   built by replacing regular straight beams with sinusoidally shaped ones,
   which are highly stretchable under uniaxial tension. Our experimental
   and numerical results indicate that the proposed lattices exhibit
   extreme Poisson's-ratio variations between -0.7 and 0.5 over large
   tensile deformations up to 50\%. This large variation of Poisson's-ratio
   values is attributed to the deformation pattern switching from bending
   to stretching within the sinusoidally shaped beams. The interplay
   between the multiscale (ligament and cell) architecture and wave
   propagation also enables remarkable broadband vibration-mitigation
   capability of the lattice metamaterials, which can be dynamically tuned
   by an external mechanical stimulus. The material design strategy
   provides insights into the development of classes of architected
   metamaterials with potential applications including energy absorption,
   tunable acoustics, vibration control, responsive devices, soft robotics,
   and stretchable electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Development and use of metamaterials have been gaining prominence in
   large part due to the possibility of creating platforms with
   ``disruptive{''} and unique optical properties. However, to date, the
   majority of such systems produced using micro or nanotechnology are
   static and can only perform certain target functions. Next-generation
   multifunctional smart optical metamaterials are expected to have tunable
   elements with the possibility of controlling the optical properties in
   real time via variation in parameters such as pressure, mechanical
   stress, and voltage or through nonlinear optical effects. Here, we
   address this challenge by developing a thermally controlled optical
   switch, based on the self-assembly of
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-functionalized gold nanoparticles on a
   planar macroscale gold substrate. We show that such meta-surfaces can be
   tuned to exhibit substantial changes in the optical properties in terms
   of both wavelength and intensity, through the temperature-controlled
   variation of the interparticle distance within the nanoparticle
   monolayer as well as its separation from the substrate. This change is
   based on temperature-induced auxetic expansion and contraction of the
   functional ligands. Such a system has potential for numerous
   applications, ranging from thermal sensors to regulated light
   harnessing.}},

Title = {{3d printed continuous fiber reinforced composite auxetic honeycomb
   structures}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{187}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite (CFRTPC) auxetic
   honeycomb structures were fabricated using the 3D printing technology
   with a specific printing path planning. For comparison, auxetic
   honeycombs were also fabricated with pure polylactic acid (PLA).
   In-plane compression tests were conducted, with corresponding damage
   types explored using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images. A
   printing path-based finite element (FE) method was developed to mimic
   both small and large deformations of CFRTPC auxetic honeycombs, while
   analytical model was proposed to predict their effective stiffness and
   Poisson ratio. Good agreement was achieved among analytical predictions,
   FE simulation results and experimental measurements. A systematic
   parametric study was subsequently carried out to quantify the dependence
   of in-plane mechanical properties on geometrical parameters. Compared
   with pure PLA structures, the presence of continuous fibers efficiently
   prohibited crack propagation in the matrix for each ligament of CFRTPC
   auxetic honeycombs. Adding continuous fibers increased the mass only by
   6\%, but led to dramatic increase in compressive stiffness and energy
   absorption by 86.3\% and 100\% respectively and smaller Poisson ratios.
   The proposed 3D printing technology has great potential in integrated
   fabrication of continuous fiber reinforced composite lightweight
   structures having complex shapes, attractive mechanical properties, and
   multifunctional attributes.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Smart materials in auxetic form present a great potential for various
   medical applications due to their unique deformation mechanisms along
   with durable infrastructure. Both analytical and finite element (FE)
   models are extensively used in literature to characterize mechanical
   response of auxetic structures but these structures are mostly thick
   enough to be considered as bulk material and 3D inherently. Auxetic
   plates in very thin form, a. e. foil, may bring numerous advantages such
   as very light design and better biodegradability when needed. However,
   there is a gap in literature on mechanical characterization of auxetic
   thin plates. In this study, structural analysis of very thin auxetic
   plates under uniaxial loading is investigated using both FE method and
   experimental method. 25 mu m thick stainless steel (316L) plates are
   fabricated with reentrant texture for three different unit cell
   dimensions and tested under uniaxial loading using universal testing
   machine. 25 and 50 mu m thick sheets with same cell dimensions were
   analyzed using implicit transient FE model including strain hardening
   and failure behaviors. FE results cover all the deformation schemes seen
   in actual tests and total deformation level matches with test results.
   Effect of plate thickness and cell geometry on auxetic behavior is
   discussed in detail using FE results. Finally, based on FE analysis
   results, an optimum geometry for prolonged auxetic behavior, high
   flexibility and high durability is suggested for future potential
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) between the Siberia
   paleo-continent and the North China paleo-continent has a close
   relationship with the evolution of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. The
   Xing'an-Mongolia Orogenic Belt (XMOB) as eastern part of the CAOB is
   located in North China. It is generally considered that the closure of
   the Paleo-Asian Ocean resulted in the formation of the XMOB, but there
   remain some disputes about the tectonic attribute of the northern margin
   of the North China Craton and where the Paleo-Asian Ocean finally closed
   and how it behaves due to complex evolution process, extensive coverage
   of Cenozoic sediments and the lack of high resolution deep exploration
   data.
   Structures and some major discontinuities beneath stations can be imaged
   by the receiver function method. In recent years, this method has become
   a mature and effective tool for studying the velocity structure of the
   crust and upper mantle. By the H-kappa stacking method, the P-to-S
   converted waves at the Moho discontinuity and their multiple reflections
   are used to calculate crust thickness and V-p/V-s ratio, which provide a
   way to study the rock composition of the crust and stress condition
   under stations.
   Funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Institute of
   Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences deployed 41 portable
   broadband seismic stations from Huailai county in northern North China
   to Bayinondor town near the China-Mongolia border. The profile extends
   along the reflection and refraction profile funded by Sinoprobe project,
   crossing the Yinshan-Yanshan orogenic belt, the Inner Mongolia
   paleo-uplift, the Bainaimiao arc, the Ondor sum subduction accretion
   complex, the Solonker suture zone (the Solonder suture zone, located
   between the North China plate and Siberia plate, representing the
   closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean), the Baolidao arc accretion complex,
   the Hegenshan ophiolite arc accretion complex and the Uliastai active
   continental margin from south to north. Recorders were set to the
   continuous recording mode and the sampling frequency was set to 50 Hz.
   The average distance between two neighbouring stations is 15 km and the
   length of the profile is about 650 km. Up to December 2014, we got 421
   GB raw data in total.
   First, we select 746 teleseismic events of m(b) > 5 from 30 to 95
   degrees and obtain their P waveforms from -20 s to 100 s with respect to
   the first P arrival time. Then, 3-component waveform data with high
   signal-noise ratio are pre-processed (including mean removal and linear
   removal) and pre-filtering at 0.02 similar to 2 Hz and then rotated
   Z-N-E to the Z-R-T coordinate system. Finally we obtain 1844 P-wave
   receiver functions by the time domain iterative deconvolution method.
   After that we obtain the crustal thicknesses, V-p/V-s ratios and Poisson
   ratios beneath the profile by the H-kappa stacking method and image
   extension of the Moho interface by the Common Coversion Point (CCP)
   stacking method. The results are as follows:
   (1) The Moho depth on average is 40 km along the profile. The crust
   thickness changes little across different tectonic blocks but shows
   evident variation at the boundaries between the blocks. The Moho dips
   southward beneath the Ondor sum belt and the Bainaimiao belt, while dips
   northward beneath the Baolidao belt and the Hegenshan belt. The Linxi
   fault seems to be as the boundary dividing the northern margin of North
   China Craton (NCC) and the southern CAOB. (2) The Poisson ratio shows a
   correlation with the tectonic unit along the profile. The averaged
   Poisson ratio in the northern margin of NCC is larger than the southern
   part of CAOB. The Poisson ratio changes little within the blocks except
   nearby the boundaries of different blocks. (3) There is a negative
   correlation between the crust thickness and the Poisson ratio that
   indicates the lateral heterogeneities of the crust structure resulted
   from the tectonic deformation. (4) Poisson ratio of the crust along the
   profile presents an approximately nonlinear symmetric shape relating to
   the south margin of Solonker suture zone. The characteristics of the
   crust and mantle structure and distribution of Poisson ratio along the
   profile support the geodynamic model that the Paleo-Asian Ocean
   subducted and closed at the southern margin of the Solon suture zone
   (along the Linxi fault).}},

Abstract = {{Functional auxetic composite materials can be fabricated from
   conventional or from auxetic components. The helical auxetic yarn (HAY)
   is a recently invented auxetic reinforcing component for composite
   materials. This paper investigates the Poisson's ratio behaviour of a
   further development of the HAY, needed for many practical applications.
   The 3-component auxetic yarn is based on a stiff wrap fibre (the first
   component) helically wound around an elastomeric core fibre (the second
   component) coated by a sheath (the third component). The resultant
   structure can overcome problems such as slippage of the wrap and changes
   in wrapping angles previously encountered during the manufacture and
   utilisation of the two-component HAY. The mechanical performance of
   conventional and novel systems is investigated; with emphasis on the
   differences between the engineering and true Poisson's ratio. The
   importance of the utilisation of a true tensile modulus and a true
   Poisson's ratio is demonstrated. This is the first time reported in the
   literature that an experimental auxetic effect analysis of HAYs was
   carried out by comparing true and engineering Poisson's ratio. We show
   that depending on the coating thickness of the third component, the
   3-component auxetic system can demonstrate auxetic behaviour, and the
   coating thickness can be employed as a new design parameter to tailor
   both the Poisson's ratio and modulus of this novel composite
   reinforcement for a wide range of applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The work describes the vibroacoustic behavior of anti-tetrachiral and

   the vibroacoustic behavior of auxetic hexagonal sandwich panels are
   investigated as a benchmark. The radiated sound power level of the
   structure over the frequency range of 0-1000 Hz is minimized by
   modifying the core geometry of the gradient auxetic sandwich panels.
   Several excitation cases are considered. First-order and random

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of an open-framework structure constructed of
   joints and beam members are strongly influenced by both its geometrical
   configuration and joint flexibility. This paper clarifies the
   relationship between joint flexibility and Poisson's ratio, which is a
   mechanical criterion for solid deformation. and discusses two types of
   in-plane anisotropic structures made Lip of four-coordinate flexible
   joints and elbowed beam members. Uniaxial tensile analyses estimate the
   linear and nonlinear elastic properties of these frameworks by applying
   straightforward joint modeling with multi-rotational degrees of freedom.
   The numerical results show that these proposed frameworks produce a
   variety of deformability dependent on the joint flexibility in auxetic
   deformation with a negative Poisson's ratio, the folding mechanics under
   kinematic indeterminacy, and the transition of Poisson's ratio between
   the positive and negative values. The geometrical and topological
   aspects of the obtained mechanical behaviors are discussed. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{The auxetic honeycomb core exhibits geometric nonlinearity under the
   in-plane load. As the load increases, the plastic deformation occurs.
   The elastoplastic model of the auxetic honeycombs with constant wall
   thickness is introduced based on nonlinear beam theory and elastoplastic
   theory. The solution algorithm is established. The elastoplastic
   properties of the auxetic honeycombs with different ratios of the
   thickness of honeycomb wall to the length of the inclined wall t/l,
   different ratios of the height of the vertical wall to the length of the
   inclined wall h/l, and different inclination angle theta are obtained.
   The results suggest that with the increase of strain, the geometric
   nonlinearity causes the overall stiffness of honeycombs to increase.
   Then it decreases gradually due to the plastic deformation.}},

Abstract = {{The deformation micromechanics of bacterial cellulose (BC) and
   microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) networks have been investigated using
   Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra of both BC and MFC networks
   exhibit a band initially located at similar to 1095 cm(-1). We have used
   the intensity of this band as a function of rotation angle of the
   specimens to study the cellulose fibril orientation in BC and MFC
   networks. We have also used the change in this peak's wavenumber
   position with applied tensile deformation to probe the stress-transfer
   behavior of these cellulosic materials. The intensity of this Raman band
   did not change significantly with rotation angle, indicating an in-plane
   2D network of fibrils with uniform random orientation; conversely, a
   highly oriented flax fiber exhibited a marked change in intensity with
   rotation angle. Experimental data and theoretical analysis shows that
   the Raman band shift rate arising from deformation of networks under
   tension is dependent on the angles between the axis of fibrils, the
   strain axis, the incident laser polarization direction, and the back
   scattered polarization configurations. From this analysis, the effective
   moduli of single fibrils of BC and MFC in the networks were estimated to
   be in the ranges of 79-88 and 29-36 GPa, respectively. It is shown also
   that for the model to fit the data it is necessary to use a negative
   Poisson's ratio for MFC networks and BC networks. Discussion of this
   in-plane ``auxetic' behavior is given.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study was to fabricate poly (e-caprolactone)
   (PCL)-based auxetic nanofiber membranes and characterize them for their
   mechanical and physicochemical properties. As a first step, the PCL
   nanofibers were fabricated by electrospinning with two different
   thicknesses of 40 pm (called PCL thin membrane) and 180 pm (called PCL
   thick membrane). In the second step, they were tailored into auxetic
   patterns using femtosecond laser cut technique. The physicochemical and
   mechanical properties of the auxetic nanofiber membranes were studied
   and compared with the conventional electrospun PCL nanofibers
   (non-auxetic nano fiber membranes) as a control. The results showed that
   there were no significant changes observed among them in terms of their
   chemical functionality and thermal property. However, there was a
   notable difference observed in the mechanical properties. For instance,
   the thin auxetic nanofiber membrane showed the magnitude of elongation
   almost ten times higher than the control, which clearly demonstrates the
   high flexibility of auxetic nanofiber membranes. This is because that
   the auxetic nanofiber membranes have lesser rigidity than the control
   nanofibers under the same load which could be due to the rotational
   motion of the auxetic structures. The major finding of this study is
   that the auxetic PCL nanofiber membranes are highly flexible (10-fold
   higher elongation capacity than the conventional PCL nanofibers) and
   have tunable mechanical properties. Therefore, the auxetic PCL nanofiber
   membranes may serve as a potent material in various biomedical
   applications, in particular, tissue engineering where scaffolds with
   mechanical cues play a major role.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, prior to the production of composites, auxetic and

   spinning technique. The fibres were tested and analysed in terms of
   Poisson's ratio, linear density, elongation at break and tenacity. The
   auxetic and conventional PP stable fibre reinforced composites were
   fabricated by the hand lay up method. Several mechanical properties of
   the composites were examined, including tensile strength, Young's
   modulus, elongation at break, energy absorption, impact velocity and
   damage size. SEM analysis was also conducted to identify microscopic
   changes to the overall composite structures. It was found that the
   auxetic fibre reinforced composites (7.5\% and 10\%) had the highest
   tensile strength and the auxetic fibre reinforced composite (5\%) had
   the highest Young's modulus. The highest energy absorption was observed
   for the composite made with 10\% auxetic fibre loading.}},

Title = {{An Abaqus plugin for evaluation of the Auxetic structure performance}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING WITH COMPUTERS}},
Abstract = {{The behavior of Auxetic structures is highly dependent on the geometric
   parameters of the unit cell. To achieve the desired behavior, it is
   necessary to perform a parametric study on the unit cell. A conventional
   parametric study (which includes modeling and analysis with different
   parameters) is very time consuming and error prone. The Auxetica plugin
   was produced to solve this problem. Auxetica is an Abaqus plugin
   developed to estimate Auxetic structures' performance. In this paper,
   the features and instructions of this plugin are presented. This tool
   can automatically generate and analyze re-entrant, chiral, (Tri-chiral,
   Tetra-chiral, Hexa-chiral) and anti-chiral (Tri-anti-chiral and
   Tetra-anti-chiral) in planar and cylindrical geometries. The plugin
   tasks can be categorized as follows: the first task is to generate a
   model based on parametric input. The second task is an automatic
   analysis and extraction of the target output. The third task is to
   generate models that are ready for 3D printing and testing. To validate
   the plugin, an experimental setup is prepared and samples which are made
   by 3D printing are tested. The simulation result is validated with
   experimental data before any parametric study would be carried out.
   Moreover, to understand the plugin functionality better, a parametric
   study has been done. This plugin helps to perform the parametric study
   by the user in the shortest time and with the most accuracy with the
   desired inputs.}},

Title = {{Poisson's ratio of PDMS thin films}},
Journal = {{POLYMER TESTING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{375-384}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Despite the fact that a small uncertainty in PDMS Poisson's ratio leads
   to significant errors in traction force microscopy, there is a clear
   lack of data for PDMS films at the scale of 100 mu m, a relevant size
   scale frequently employed in cell mechanics studies. Equally important
   is the need for consideration of the viscoelastic nature of PDMS, as no
   mechanical property - including Poisson's ratio - can be taken as a
   time-independent constant. The foremost challenge for addressing these
   issues is the difficulty of carrying out stress relaxation tests on
   miniature PDMS samples accompanied by non-contact strain measurement
   with a very high spatiotemporal resolution. This study introduces such a
   stress relaxation platform incorporating i) the proper means for the
   application of necessary boundary conditions, ii) a high-precision in
   load measurement, and iii) a non-contact, local strain measurement
   technique based on single particle tracking. During stretching, images
   were recorded at a rate of 18 Hz with a 40 mu m spatial resolution.
   Microsphere-embedded PDMS films as thin as 125 and 155 mu m were
   prepared to study the Poisson's ratio by a local strain microscope.
   After tracing the displacement of microspheres by a single particle
   tracking method and using a strain mapping, Poisson's ratio for 155-mu
   m-thick PDMS was found to decrease from 0.483 +/- 0.034 to 0.473 +/-
   0.040 over a period of 20 min. For 125-mu m-thick PDMS, this reduction
   took place from 0.482 +/- 0.041 to 0.468 +/- 0.038. Moreover, a
   non-monotonic reduction was observed in both cases. This negative
   correlation between Poisson's ratio and relaxation time was found to be
   statistically significant for both thicknesses with p < 0.001. The
   viscoelastic behavior was further characterized through the Burgers
   model. With a measurement field of 597 x 550 mu m(2), this study
   emphasizes the importance of the local investigation of mechanical
   properties. Furthermore, the dependence of transverse strain on a film
   thickness difference of 30 mu m was measured to determine the
   sensitivity of local strain tracking. The inherent high resolution of
   the proposed approach enables one to measure deformations more precisely
   and to observe the temporal evolution of the Poisson's ratio that has
   not been observed before. In addition to the high-precision
   determination of PDMS Poisson's ratio, this work also offers a promising
   pathway for the accurate and time dependent determination of the
   mechanical properties of other soft materials, where similar ambiguities
   exist regarding the mechanical behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Most thermal interactions between indoor and outdoor environments take
   place through building envelopes and particularly through windows due to
   glazing's inherently higher Uvalues. Therefore, an effective shading
   structure for windows, which simultaneously can provide sufficient
   illuminance levels, minimize excessive sun exposure, and ensure
   acceptable visual comfort by controlling the glare is highly desirable.
   Unlike static daylight control systems, dynamic daylight admission
   systems adjust the amount of intake sunlight with assistance from
   building occupants or mechanical devices. Studies to date have not
   thoroughly and comprehensively developed an alternative system in which
   a self-morphing structure that is responsive to changing outdoor
   environmental conditions in real-time can function as an ``adaptive
   daylight admission system.{''}
   This paper has studied the effects of the adaptable auxetic shading
   structure with varying geometries to optimize illuminance levels, sun
   exposure, and reduce probability of glare. This study has developed a
   model to evaluate the illuminance and glare performance of the proposed
   shading system, and tested in the City of Gainesville, Florida, which is
   also applicable to other locations. The results suggest that the auxetic
   shading structure can effectively block sunlight from entering the space
   by adjusting its geometry in response to varying outdoor and sky
   conditions. In addition, a strong correlation can be found among
   daylight availability, sun exposure, and glare probability. Future
   studies may explore the effect of auxetic shading structures on energy
   consumption and thermal comfort parameters. In addition, the relation
   between auxetic shading devices and the health and wellbeing of building
   occupants may also be another factor to evaluate the effectiveness of
   this new generation of shading devices. Although this study focuses on
   the building-scale level of this shading system, future studies can
   investigate the urban-scale implementation of the proposed shading
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli of 2D molecular networks having
   conventional and re-entrant honeycomb forms have been modelled using
   molecular modelling. Three principle deformation mechanisms were
   observed: bond hinging, flexure and stretching. Analytical models have
   also been developed that can be used to describe each of these modes of
   deformation acting either independently or concurrently. A parametric
   fit of the force constants in the concurrent analytical model
   calculations to the molecular model calculations yields good agreement
   in the mechanical properties for all the structures studied. Specific
   trends in the force constants required to fit the data are observed.
   Consequently, a force constants library can be compiled and has been
   used to predict accurately the properties of more complex variants of
   the networks. This semi-analytical sub-unit approach enables a more
   efficient use of computer-intensive molecular modelling programs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the thermal shock resistance of an auxetic ceramic
   honeycomb plate is studied based on the fracture mechanics concept for
   the cases of a central crack or an edge crack. The transient temperature
   field and transient thermal stress field are obtained for both auxetic
   and non-auxetic structures. The relationship between the thermal stress
   intensity factor (TSIF) and the internal cell angle, crack length and
   time is determined and the critical temperature for the initiation of
   crack propagation is predicted. Results show that compared with the
   non-auxetic ceramic honeycombs which are at an internal cell angle of 30
   degrees, the critical temperature of the auxetic ceramic honeycombs
   whose cell are orientated at an angle of - 30 degrees increases by
   78.5\% and the TSIF at the crack tip decreases by 40\%, respectively.
   Hence, the auxetic structures have better thermal shock resistance. This
   study indicates that auxetic ceramic honeycombs have significant
   potential applications in harsh temperature environments.}},

Title = {{Auxetic structures fabricated by material extrusion: an experimental
   investigation of gradient parameters}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   This paper aims to focus on studying the influence of gradient
   parameters, namely, thickness coefficient, length coefficient and height
   ratio of auxetic structure on responses such as strength, stiffness and
   specific energy absorption (SEA) under compressive loading. Optimization
   of significant parameters is also performed to maximize responses.
   Further, efforts have also been made to develop regression models for
   strength, stiffness and SEA of auxetic structure.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Central composite design of response surface methodology is used for
   planning experiments. Auxetic structures of acrylonitrile butadiene
   styrene (ABS) and poly-lactic acid (PLA) materials are fabricated by the
   material extrusion (ME) technique of additive manufacturing. Fabricated
   structures are tested under in-plane uniaxial compressive loading. Grey
   relational analysis is used for the optimization of gradient parameters
   of the unit cell of auxetic structure to maximize responses and minimize
   weight and time of fabrication.
   Findings
   From the analysis of variance of experimental data, it is found that the
   compressive strength of auxetic structures increases with a decrease in
   length coefficient and height ratio. In the case of ABS structures,
   stiffness increases with a decrease in thickness coefficient and length
   coefficient, while in the case of PLA structures, stiffness increases
   with a decrease in length coefficient and height ratio. SEA is
   influenced by length coefficient and thickness coefficient in ABS and
   PLA structures, respectively. Based on the analysis, statistical
   non-linear quadratic models are developed to predict strength, stiffness
   and SEA. Optimal configuration of auxetic structure is determined to
   maximize strength, stiffness, SEA and minimize weight and time of
   fabrication.
   Research limitations/implications
   The present study is limited to re-entrant type of auxetic structures
   made of ABS and PLA materials only under compressive loading. Also,
   results from the current study are valid within a selected range of
   gradient parameters. The findings of the present study are useful in the
   optimal selection of gradient parameters for the fabrication of auxetic
   structures of maximum strength, stiffness and SEA with minimum weight
   and time of fabrication. These outcomes have wide applications in
   domains such as automotive, aerospace, sports and marine sectors.
   Originality/value
   Limited literature is available on studying the influence of gradient
   parameters of ME manufactured auxetic structure of ABS and PLA materials
   on responses, namely, strength, stiffness and SEA under compressive
   loading. Also, no work has been reported on studying the influence of
   gradient parameters on mechanical properties, weight and time of
   fabrication of auxetic structures. The present study is an attempt to
   fulfil the above research gaps.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, Electron Beam Melting (EBM) is used to produce chiral
   auxetic lattices, and the compression of chiral auxetic lattice is
   investigated experimentally and numerically in the edgewise direction,
   where auxeticity can be experienced. Titanium Alloy (Ti6Al4V) metallic
   powder is used in this study. To understand mechanical behaviour and to
   characterize EBM printed parts, tensile tests are conducted. According
   to the tensile test results, a constitutive equation is selected,
   calibrated and adopted to represent the behaviour of the material.
   Furthermore, a chiral unit cell is manufactured and tested with a
   compressive load profile to investigate its displacement limit by
   applying large displacements without experiencing permanent
   deformations, degradation or failures. The same scenarios explored in
   the experiments are then analyzed by means of non-linear computational
   models using a commercial finite element code to validate a numerical
   approach for optimal design and performance prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical studies in overactive bladder have traditionally used analysis
   of covariance or nonparametric methods to analyse the number of
   incontinence episodes and other count data. It is known that if the
   underlying distributional assumptions of a particular parametric method
   do not hold, an alternative parametric method may be more efficient than
   a nonparametric one, which makes no assumptions regarding the underlying
   distribution of the data. Therefore, there are advantages in using
   methods based on the Poisson distribution or extensions of that method,
   which incorporate specific features that provide a modelling framework
   for count data. One challenge with count data is overdispersion, but
   methods are available that can account for this through the introduction
   of random effect terms in the modelling, and it is this modelling
   framework that leads to the negative binomial distribution. These models
   can also provide clinicians with a clearer and more appropriate
   interpretation of treatment effects in terms of rate ratios. In this
   paper, the previously used parametric and non-parametric approaches are
   contrasted with those based on Poisson regression and various extensions
   in trials evaluating solifenacin and mirabegron in patients with
   overactive bladder. In these applications, negative binomial models are
   seen to fit the data well. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   auxetic hierarchical honeycomb crash box}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION}},
Abstract = {{This paper takes into consideration the excellent energy absorption
   ability of hierarchical honeycombs and auxetic structures and proposes a
   novel auxetic hierarchical crash box assembled by the auxetic
   hierarchical filling cores and the outer square thin-walled tube. The
   crushing performance of the auxetic hierarchical crash box is
   systematically investigated. The comparisons of energy absorption
   ability are made among the auxetic hierarchical crash box, aluminum
   foam-filled crash box, and the traditional crash box. In addition, a
   multi-objective optimization design is conducted based on the surrogate
   model with higher accuracy. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm
   (NSGA-II) and archive-based micro genetic algorithm (AMGA) are,
   respectively, employed to obtain the pareto sets. The results show that
   the optimum solution with AMGA has a smaller relative error, and the
   multi-objective optimization successfully improves the crushing
   performance of the auxetic hierarchical crash box. The electric vehicle
   crashworthiness is remarkably improved by the application of the auxetic
   hierarchical crash box. The conclusions of this paper can provide a new
   solution for the design of the crash box.}},

Abstract = {{Two challenges in mechanics of granular media are taken up in this
   paper: (i) development of adequate numerical discrete element models of
   topologically disordered granular assemblies and (ii) calculation of
   macroscopic elastic moduli of such materials using effective medium
   theories. Consideration of the first one leads to an adaptation of a
   spring-network (Kirkwood) model of solid-state physics to disordered
   systems, which is developed in the context of planar Delaunay networks.
   The model! employs two linear springs: a normal one along an edge
   connecting two neighboring vertices (grain centers) which accounts for
   normal interactions between the grains, as well as an angular one which
   accounts for angle changes between two edges incident onto the same
   vertex; edges remain straight and grain rotations do not appear This
   model is then used to predict elastic moduli of two-phase granular
   materials-random mixtures of soft and stiff grains-for high coordination
   numbers. It is found here that an effective Poisson's ratio, nu(eff), Of
   such a mixture is a convex function of the volume fraction, so that
   nu(eff) may become negative when the individual Poisson's ratios of both
   phases are both positive. Additionally, the usefulness of three
   effective medium theories-perfect disks, symmetric ellipses, and
   asymmetric ellipses-is tested.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the vibroacoustic behavior of sandwich panels with
   a novel core topology made from 2-dimensionally gradient auxetic
   hexagonal honeycombs. The 2D gradient core enables a tailoring of
   localized mechanical properties of the sandwich structure in different
   regions of the panel. A homogenized finite element modeling has been
   used to initially determine the mechanical properties of the structures.
   The natural frequencies and the radiated sound power level of the
   sandwich plate with the homogenized properties have been calculated and
   verified with those obtained from a full-scale detailed model of the
   sandwich structure. The geometry of the 2-dimensionally gradient auxetic
   core has been then optimized using two different techniques in order to
   minimize the radiated sound power level over the frequency range of 0 to
   200 Hz. The optimized design of the 2-D gradient core shows a remarkable
   reduction of the radiated sound power level for the sandwich structure
   when taking into account the mass of the panels. The results of this
   study provide new insights about the vibroacoustic behavior of hexagonal

Abstract = {{A theoretical model has been developed for predicting the elastic
   constants of honeycombs based on the deformation of the honeycomb cells
   by flexure, stretching and hinging. This is an extension of earlier work
   based on flexure alone. The model has been used to derive expressions
   for the tensile moduli, shear moduli and Poisson's ratios. Examples are
   given of structures with a negative Poisson's ratio. It is shown how the
   properties can be tailored by varying the relative magnitudes of the
   force constants for the different deformation mechanisms. Off-axis
   elastic constants are also calculated and it is shown how the moduli and
   Poisson's ratios vary with applied loading direction. Depending on the
   geometry of the honeycomb the properties may be isotropic (for regular
   hexagons) or extremely anisotropic. Again, the degree of anisotropy is
   also affected by the relative magnitude of the force constants for the
   three deformation mechanisms. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   out-of-plane Young modulus with respect to the stiffest phase for some
   semi-auxetic laminates is much bigger and spread over a wider interval
   of volume fraction, bigger and wider than the ones showed by him. In all

Abstract = {{In this paper, the quasi-static compression behavior of graded metallic
   auxetic reentrant honeycomb was firstly studied. Using the selective
   laser melting method, the unidirectionally-graded auxetic honeycomb
   (UGAH) and bidirectionally-graded auxetic honeycomb (BGAH) with the
   equal mass were fabricated to conduct the compression tests. The
   deformation mode, crushing stress and Poisson's ratio distribution of
   graded auxetic honeycombs were presented. Experiment results showed that
   the compression behavior of graded auxetic honeycomb was different from
   that of graded honeycomb with positive Poisson's ratio owing to the
   horizontal shrinkage deformation and the gradient distribution had
   effects on the crushing stress and Poisson's ratio. Then, a finite
   element (FE) model of the graded auxetic honeycomb was established and
   the calculation results were systematically compared with the
   experimental results. The effects of gradient distribution on the energy
   dissipation characteristics of the graded auxetic honeycomb were
   studied, The results showed that the energy dissipation of the UGAH was
   lower than that of the BGAH before the graded layer with the maximum
   cell-wall thickness was densified.}},

Abstract = {{Silica or SiO2, the main constituent of Earth's rocks has several 3D
   complex crystalline and amorphous phases, but it does not have a
   graphitelike layered structure in 3D. Our theoretical analysis and
   numerical calculations from the first principles predict a single-layer
   honeycomblike allotrope, ha silica, which can be viewed to be derived
   from the oxidation of silicene and it has intriguing atomic structure
   with reentrant bond angles in hexagons. It is a wide band gap
   semiconductor, which attains remarkable electromechanical properties
   showing geometrical changes under an external electric field. In
   particular, it is an auxetic metamaterial with a negative Poisson's
   ratio and has a high piezoelectric coefficient. While it can form stable
   bilayer and multilayer structures, its nanoribbons can show metallic or
   semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality. Coverage of
   dangling Si orbitals by foreign adatoms can attribute new
   functionalities to ha silica. In particular, Si2O5, where Si atoms are
   saturated by oxygen atoms from top and bottom sides alternatingly can
   undergo a structural transformation to make silicatene, another stable,
   single layer structure of silica.}},

Abstract = {{The investigation assesses the thermal-mechanical and thermodynamic
   properties of various graphene sheets using a modified Nose-Hoover (NH)
   thermostat method incorporated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.
   The investigation begins with an exploration of their thermal-mechanical
   properties at atmospheric pressure, including Young's modulus, shear
   modulus, Poisson's ratio, specific heats and linear and volumetric
   coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE). Two definitions of the line
   change ratio (Delta L/L) are utilized to determine the linear CTE of
   graphene sheets, and the calculations are compared with each other and
   data in the literature. To estimate the volumetric CTE values, the
   Connolly surface method is applied to predict the volume of the deformed
   graphene sheets in the free relaxation state and under temperature
   loading. Their specific heats are also determined by estimating the
   ratio of the amount of heat energy per unit mass that is required to
   raise the temperature-by one degree. Finally, the dependences of the
   size and temperature on the thermal-mechanical and thermodynamic
   properties are examined. The calculations are validated by comparison
   with the results obtained from the existing thermostats and with the
   literature experimental and theoretical data The results indicate that
   the presently calculated thermal-mechanical and thermodynamic properties
   of graphene sheets are very similar to the published experimental and
   theoretical results. The graphene sheets tend to have a negative linear
   CTE at temperatures below 300 K. Additionally, the calculated linear CTE
   of graphene sheets depends strongly on the line-change-ratio
   assumptions. The modified NH thermostat is the only one of five
   thermostats that can accurately reproduce the Debye T-3-dependent
   specific heat at temperatures below the Debye temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Using a melt electrospinning technique, stretchable force sensors were
   designed for use in an application of hand rehabilitation. The main
   purpose of this study was to verify that the use of auxetic sensors
   improved hand rehabilitation practices when compared to their absence.
   For this study, novel stretchable poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL)
   force sensors were fabricated into the following formations: auxetic
   microfiber sheets (AMSs), auxetic solid sheets (ASSs), microfiber sheets
   (MSs), and solid sheets (SSs). A femtosecond laser device was used to
   make an auxetic structure in the MSs and SSs. Subsequently, these
   sensors were coated with gold particles to make them conductive for the
   electrical current resistance assays. Through the cycles of applied
   stress and strain, auxetic structures were able to retain their original
   shape once these forces have been dissipated. This stretchable sensor
   could potentially measure applied external loads, resistance, and strain
   and could also be attachable to a desired substrate. In order to verify
   the workability and practicality of our designed sensors, we have
   attempted to use the sensors on a human hand. The AMS sensor had the
   highest sensitivity on measuring force and resistance among the four
   types of sensors. To our knowledge, this is the first study to form a
   stretchable force sensor using a melt electrospinning technique.}},

Title = {{Experimental and numerical study on the structural performance of
   auxetic-shaped, ring-shaped and unstiffened steel plate shear walls}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{34}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Structural engineers have always tried to enhance the seismic
   performance of existing building systems by introducing new solutions to
   increase the amount of ductility along with dissipated seismic energy.
   In this regard, this paper presents a new system to improve the
   structural behavior of unstiffened steel plate shear walls and eliminate
   the known defects of these efficient seismic-resistant systems. One of
   the significant drawbacks of unstiffened steel plate shear walls is the
   pinching of their hysteretic curve that happens due to the early
   out-of-plane buckling of the infill plate under small shear forces.
   Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to reduce the amount of
   out-of-plane buckling using perforated plates with periodic
   auxetic-shaped cellular forms, which have a negative Poisson's ratio. To
   this aim, a parametric study is conducted on 255 finite element models
   of auxetic-shaped steel plate shear walls using ABAQUS software to
   select the most efficient configuration considering some design
   parameters such as the amount of out-of-plane buckling, energy
   dissipation and strength. Then, two full-scale specimens of the selected
   models are investigated experimentally under a quasistatic cyclic
   loading history. Finally, regarding this fact that for broader adoption
   of a new system, besides its structural performance, the total weight of
   that structural system is a determinant factor, two 5- and 10-story
   plane building models with unstiffened and auxetic-shaped steel plate
   shear walls are designed to have the life safety performance level at
   the BSE-1 hazard level and they are evaluated by performing nonlinear
   static analyses. The results show that auxetic-shaped steel plate shear
   walls, while improving the seismic performance of a building, reduce its
   weight.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate the evolution of magnetic domains with time
   in magnetic auxetic systems using the Ising model. We show that the
   mechanical deformation of the structure affects the way how domains
   evolve and that their rate of growth does not follow a well-known power
   law associated with the Ising model for systems corresponding to a
   specific distance between Ising spins. We also show that the variation
   in the rate of deformation of the system leads to completely different
   results in terms of the change in size of magnetic domains and domain
   energy. This means that upon changing the speed used to deform the
   system, it is possible to control the growth of magnetic domains and
   hence control the magnetic properties of the whole system. This may
   prove to be very important in the case of potential applications such as
   magnetic freezers where the magnetocaloric effect resulting with a
   change in temperature could be affected by the rate of deformation of
   the discussed auxetic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Most of usual materials exhibit Poisson's ratio comprised between 0 and
   0.5. But, for some kind of cellular materials, or for some stacking
   sequences of unidirectional plies, a composite material can exhibit
   negative or greater than 0.5 Poisson's ratios. In this paper, a study of
   different stacking sequences such as {[}+/-beta/+/-theta](s) plies made
   from highly anisotropic fibre pre-preg is presented. A special computer
   programme has been developed for this purpose. Eighteen stacking
   sequences, including the {[}+/-theta] ones, have been computed. The

Abstract = {{Auxetic composites, a kind of rationally artificial materials, possess
   superior multifunctional properties due to a mixture of materials. In
   this paper, an Isogeometric Topology Optimization (ITO) method is
   proposed for computational design of both the re-entrant and chiral
   auxetic composites in both 2D and 3D. The homogenization is numerically
   implemented using isogeometric analysis (IGA) to predict macroscopic
   effective properties of microstructures, where the periodic boundary
   formulation is imposed. An effective Non-Uniform Rational B-splines
   (NURBS)-based Multi-Material Interpolation (N-MMI) model is applied to
   compute material properties of all points in composite microstructures,
   mainly including the Fields of Design Variables (DVFs), Fields of
   Topology Variables (TVFs), and multi-material interpolation. A unified
   ITO formulation is developed for 2D and 3D auxetic composites, where an
   appropriate objective function with a weight parameter is defined to
   control the generation of different deformation mechanisms. Finally,
   several numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed ITO method, and a series of 2D and 3D
   auxetic composites with the re-entrant and chiral deformation mechanisms
   are found. The optimized composite structures are simulated using ANSYS
   to show the auxetic behavior. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures are designed to be used for producing auxetic
   materials with controllable mechanical properties. The present study
   treats a design of viscoelastic auxetic honeycomb structures using
   numerical approach and mathematical formulation for impact mitigation.
   In order to increase the energy absorption capacity, viscoelastic
   material has been added into auxetic structure as it has capability to
   dissipate energy under impact loading. Kelvin-Voigt and Maxwell models
   were employed to model viscoelastic components. The auxetic structure
   was then subjected to impact load with linear and nonlinear load
   functions. Dynamic analysis was carried out on a star honeycomb
   structure using continuum mechanics. Influence of different parameters
   on response function was then further studied. The primary outcome of
   this research is the development of viscoelastic auxetic honeycomb
   structural design for predicting the impact resistance under impact

Abstract = {{The existence of a new two dimensional CN2 structure was predicted using
   ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and density-functional theory
   calculations. It consists of tetragonal and hexagonal rings with C-N and
   N-N bonds arranged in a buckling plane, isostructural to the
   tetrahex-carbon allotrope. It is thermodynamically and kinetically
   stable suggested by its phonon spectrum and AIMD. This nanosheet has a
   high concentration of N and contains N-N single bonds with an energy
   density of 6.3 kJ g(-1), indicating its potential applications as a high
   energy density material. It possesses exotic mechanical properties with
   a negative Poisson's ratio and an anisotropic Young's modulus. The
   modulus in the zigzag direction is predicted to be 340 N m(-1), stiffer
   than those of h-BN and penta-CN2 sheets and comparable to that of
   graphene. Its ideal strength of 28.8 N m(-1) outperforms that of
   penta-graphene. The material maintains phonon stability upon the
   application of uniaxial strain up to 10\% (13\%) in the zigzag
   (armchair) direction or biaxial strain up to 5\%. It possesses a wide
   indirect HSE band gap of 4.57 eV, which is tunable between 3.37-4.57 eV
   through strain. Double-layered structures are also explored. Such unique
   properties may facilitate its potential applications as a high energy
   density material and in nanomechanics and electronics.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a hybrid laminated plate is developed by changing ply
   orientations and stacking sequences. The hybrid laminated plate is
   composed of carbon nanotube reinforced composite and fiber reinforced
   composite layers. Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) is obtained for the
   case of {[}22(F)/(22(C)/-22(C))(3T)/-22(F)] laminate. A theoretical
   laminated model considering geometric nonlinearity and shear deformation
   is presented. Based on a two-step perturbation method, the solutions of
   the motion equations are obtained to capture the non-linear frequencies
   and load-deflection curves. On this basis, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta
   method is used to obtain the dynamic response of hybrid laminated
   plates. The presented model is verified by comparing the results
   obtained analytically and numerically. Several factors such as loading
   and distribution of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and foundation type are
   considered in parametric study. Numerical results indicate that the
   thermal-mechanical behavior of hybrid laminated plates significantly
   improved by properly adjusting the CNT distribution. In addition, the
   results reveal that changes in temperature and foundation stiffness have
   pronounced influence on the nonlinear vibration characteristics of
   hybrid laminate plates with NPR as compared to those with positive
   Poisson's ratio.}},

Title = {{Development of 3D auxetic structures using para-aramid and ultra-high
   molecular weight polyethylene yarns}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE}},
Abstract = {{In recent times, auxetic woven structures gained considerable attention
   from the researchers due to their excellent impact properties in
   high-performance areas. Researchers have done much work on the auxetic
   behavior of the natural and low-performance yarns in two-dimensional
   structures. Keeping in view the structural application of auxetic
   structures, in this work, three-dimensional (3D) woven auxetic fabrics
   were developed on conventional weaving machines with high-performance
   yarns. Effect of high-performance yarns (Para-aramid and UHMWPE) as the
   main structure and binding threads on the auxeticity of 3D fabric
   structures and the impact properties of their corresponding composites
   were discussed. For this purpose, eight different orthogonal 3D woven
   structures were produced with para-aramid filament yarn as warp and
   weft, whereas ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) filament
   yarn was used as a binder. The tensile load was applied to the 3D
   fabrics to check their auxeticity, and a change in thickness was
   recorded. The results showed that as the float length of binder yarn and
   warp yarn increases with the equal and same ratio, the auxeticity also
   increases. While auxeticity decreases as the difference between the
   float length of binder yarn and warp yarn increases. The Negative
   Poisson's Ratio (NPR) of 3D woven fabrics ranged from -0.9 to -2.98. In
   the second step, these 3D woven fabrics were fabricated into their
   composites using unsaturated polyester resin, and the hand-layup
   technique. Their impact strength was measured using the Charpy test
   method. Auxetic woven composites made of high-performance yarns
   structures showed impact strength ranging from 55.64 kJ/m(2)to 158.46
   kJ/m(2).}},

Abstract = {{Biomaterials are porous and three-dimensional (3D) templates, which are
   used as biological substitutes in tissue engineering. Targeting the
   optimal design of biomaterials requires a synergy between mechanical,
   porous, mass transport, and biological properties. To address this
   challenge, we propose a non-periodic meta-biomaterial in the form of an
   out-of-plane auxetic nonwoven scaffold that possesses a 3D
   interconnected highly porous structure with remarkable mechanical
   properties corresponding to conventional nonwoven material. A design
   strategy of utilizing larger fiber diameters to enhance the porosity and
   permeability characteristics successfully devised the nonwoven scaffold
   with an extraordinary out-of-plane auxetic effect. In situ tensile-X-ray
   microcomputed to-mography (microCT) analysis has been carried out to
   monitor the variation in the morphological characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to identify the composition of the pyrolysis products
   obtained through pyrolysis in the structure of different auxetic
   designs. Two design specimens of auxetic nano-carbon fibers with
   different directional load were fabricated, solid carbon fibers and
   hexagonal auxetic carbon fibers. The deformation behavior is well-known
   and has been analyzed. 3D finite element (FE) models were used to
   investigate both structures. There was some impact on the specimens
   used, and the behavior of the strain and stress line was captured. The
   main purpose of the experiment was to define and test the auxetic
   structure's use in industries that require nano-carbon fiber material
   that has excessively good mechanical and thermal properties. In order to
   prevent the deterioration of the properties caused by this phenomenon,
   sizing of the yarns and bundles was carried out. Moreover, to form a
   sizing coating on the elementary fibers, DMA tests have been conducted,
   and both the thermal and mechanical properties investigated. In this
   case, the sizing agent must be in a sufficiently softened state. The
   compositions can improve nano-carbon vs the adhesion of the polymer
   matrix for auxetic nano-carbon fibers, which allows the use of such
   fibers for the reinforcement of plastics without extra processing.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter begins with some general considerations on the
   thermoelasticity of auxetic solids, followed by the thermal elasticity
   of 3D auxetic solids with geometrical constraints. Thereafter, the
   thermoelasticity of beams and plates arising from a given temperature
   profile is furnished. Based on a set of dimensionless thermal stresses
   for application in auxetic plates and shells, it was found that thermal
   stresses reduce as the material becomes more auxetic at constant Young's
   modulus (E), and constant shear modulus (G), but the thermal stresses
   increase as the material becomes more auxetic at constant bulk modulus
   (K). In the case of constant product of EGK, the thermal stress is
   maximum at Poisson's ratio of 0.303, but diminishes at Poisson's ratios
   of 1 and 0.5. In most cases of solids considered in this chapter, the
   thermal stresses are minimized in the auxetic region. Finally a summary
   of thermal conductivity study in multi-re-entrant honeycombs by
   Innocenti and Scarpa (J Compos Mater 43(21):2419-2439, 2009) is given,
   in which the results suggest that auxetic honeycomb configurations
   exhibit higher out-of-plane conductivity, strong in-plane thermal
   anisotropy, and the lowest peak temperatures during heat transfer
   between the bottom and top faces of honeycomb panels.}},

Abstract = {{Polymers containing para-quaterphenyl rods laterally attached to the
   polymer main chain have been synthesized. The molecular design choices
   which led to use of the quaterphenyl rod to achieve auxetic response
   will be discussed. Preparative chemistry of the monomers will be
   described along with the details of the polymerization reaction. Both
   polyethers and polyesters were prepared. The length of the flexible
   alkyl main chains which link the rods plays an important role in
   determining whether the resulting polymers will exhibit liquid
   crystallinity. Polymers with longer alkyl links exhibit nematic liquid
   crystallinity and the rods appear to have their long axes oriented
   roughly parallel and along the main chain direction. X-ray scattering
   experiments were performed on the polymers both in the quiescent
   (unstretched) and the stretched states. Results from these experiments
   suggest that, under tensile strain, site connectivity driven
   rod-reorientation occurs in these materials giving rise to an increase
   in the interchain distance for these polymers. This increase in the
   interchain separation is consistent with our concept of a molecular
   level auxetic mechanism for this type of designed polymer. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Orthopedic bone plates are most commonly used for bone fracture fixation
   for more than 100 years. The bone plate design had evolved over time
   overcoming many challenges such as insufficient strength and excessive
   plate-bone contact affecting the blood circulation. However, it is only
   made of two materials, either stainless steel (AISI 316L) or titanium
   (Ti-6Al-4V). There are two main limitations of metallic bone implants,
   namely stress shielding and the problem of malocclusion caused by the
   displacement of the fracture site during healing. To overcome the two
   problems, a new bone plate design with the incorporation of auxetic
   structures is proposed in this work. This study aims to use auxetic
   structure section in the bone plate that would decrease the stiffness of
   the region, thereby mitigating the stress-shielding effect and at the
   same time act as a deformable section to enable intra-operative bending
   for effective alignment while having enough bending strength and
   stiffness. Two different auxetic structures namely re-entrant honeycomb
   and missing rib structures were considered. The auxetic structure
   incorporated bone plates were designed, finite element analysis was
   done, fabricated using direct metal laser sintering technique, and
   tested. The results indicate that the re-entrant honeycomb structure
   incorporated bone plates serve as an effective bone design compared to
   the conventional bone plate design, in terms of stress shielding and
   intra-operative bending while offering similar mechanical and bending
   strength.}},

   narrow intervals, despite small numbers of arrivals. However, the

   providing coverage while providing substantially narrower intervals.
   These intervals might have practical applications. In a sensitivity

Abstract = {{To identify events that could predict province-level frequency of
   foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks in Iran, 5707 outbreaks reported
   from April 1995 to March 2002 were studied. A zero-inflated negative
   binomial model was used to estimate the probability of a `no-outbreak'
   status and the number of outbreaks in a province, using the number of
   previous occurrences of FMD for the same or adjacent provinces and
   season as covariates. For each province, the probability of observing no
   outbreak was negatively associated with the number of outbreaks in the
   same province in the previous month (odds ratio {[}OR] = 0.06, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.01, 0.30) and in `the second previous
   month' (OR = 0.10, 95\% CI: 0.02, 0.51), the total number of outbreaks
   in the second previous month in adjacent provinces (OR = 0.57, 95\% CI:
   0.36, 0.91) and the season (winter {[}OR = 0.18, 95\% CI: 0.06, 0.55]
   and spring {[}OR = 0.27, 95\% CI: 0.09, 0.81], compared with summer).
   The expected number of outbreaks in a province was positively associated
   with number of outbreaks in the same province in previous month
   (coefficient {[}coef] = 0.74, 95\% CI: 0.66, 0.82) and in the second
   previous month (coef = 0.23,95\% CI: 0.16, 0.31), total number of
   outbreaks in adjacent provinces in the previous month (coef = 0.32, 95\%
   CI: 0.22, 0.41) and season (fall {[}coef = 0.20, 95\% CI: 0.07, 0.33]
   and spring {[}coef = 0.18, 95\% CI: 0.05, 0.31], compared to summer);
   however, number of outbreaks was negatively associated with the total
   number of outbreaks in adjacent provinces in the second previous month
   (coef = -0.19, 95\% CI: -0.28, -0.09). The findings indicate that the
   probability of an outbreak (and the expected number of outbreaks if any)
   may be predicted based on previous province information, which could
   help decision-makers allocate resources more efficiently for
   province-level disease control measures. Further, the study illustrates
   use of zero inflated negative binomial model to study diseases
   occurrence where disease is infrequently observed. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{A new concept to enhance efficiency of the acoustic energy harvesting is
   presented and experimentally tested in this paper. An auxetic latticed
   resonator backed by an acoustic rectangular tube is proposed for this
   purpose. The concept is tested and proved by comparing the extracted
   power against performance of a conventional cantilever resonator at
   resonant-resonant condition. The problem is modeled by the Finite
   Element Method. The models are validated using experimental tests. The
   energy harvesting performance is numerically evaluated in different
   sound powers, geometrical aspects and electrical properties. In a
   parametric study, performance of the proposed auxetic resonator is
   compared with a plain one. It is shown that employing the concept can
   remarkably enhance performance of the acoustic energy harvesting system.
   At low frequencies, 138 Hz in this study, at an optimum situation we
   could arrive at a large magnification factor around 10.5 for 100 dB

Abstract = {{Metamaterials are the class of man-made cellular structures that are
   intended to improve the energy absorption ability without an expense on
   its weight. The current investigation focuses on modeling and
   compressive simulation of three types of basic metamaterial (i.e
   Diamond, Auxetic and Hexagon) and its hybrids (i.e Auxetic-diamond,
   Auxetic-hexagon and Diamond-hexagon) with Ansys 19 simulation software.
   All the six auxetic metamaterials are simulated by assuming Polylactic
   Acid (PLA) material. At 0.1 MPa the maximum equivalent von-Mises stress
   was evident during the compressive analysis of auxetic-diamond hybrid
   structure. For auxetic-diamond hybrid structure higher energy absorption
   of 40 mJ was noted. It was observed to decrease by 67, 62, 75, 25 and
   40\% for auxetic, diamond, hexagon, auxetic-hexagon and diamond-hexagon
   respectively. The higher value of equivalent von-Mises stress and higher
   energy absorption is a manifestation of stiffest structure. The
   deformation results during simulation test confirmed that the basic
   auxetic structure and its hybrid absorb more energy. The hybrid auxetic
   metamaterials are the new class structural elements that exhibited
   extraordinary energy absorption ability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

   the fabrication-oriented surface tiling methods introduce additional
   primitives, such as curve networks in an interactive semiautomatic
   framework. Our method is based on a remeshing procedure that converts a
   given quad mesh with arbitrary topology into our desired structure that
   is ready to be fabricated. The main advantages of establishing auxetic
   patterns on meshes are the achieved flexibility using cheap inflexible
   materials as well as less material usage and fabrication time, as
   demonstrated in our results.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the increasingly serious environmental pollution and the extreme
   shortage of energy resources, harvesting clean and sustainable random
   energy from the environment is a scientific, effective, and necessary
   solution in the coming intelligent era. Such random and disorder energy,
   like that from human motion and textile-related movement, can be
   obtained via textile-based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs).
   However, research related to textile-based TENGs with mature,
   high-efficiency, and economical manufacturing techniques is limited.
   Here, by using a high-speed ring spinning method, negative Poisson's
   ratio yarn (NPRY) with a composite structure is designed and fabricated
   as a variety of intelligent device. Based on the special negative
   Poisson's ratio effect, NPRY combined with TENG can be used as a
   foundation structure to form diverse flexible textile-based electronic
   devices, such as an energy harvesting fabric, a self-counting yoga
   elastic band, and a self-powered pre-alarm cable. At the same time,
   NPRY-TENGs with different structures and structural parameters are
   systematically investigated to optimize the output performance in this
   work. This special, low-cost, and highly efficient NPRY as a foundation
   structure material has promising applications in the manufacture of all
   kinds of textile-based TENGs and harvesting a lot of random energy from
   the environment, where the random energy can be used by other electronic
   devices or those textile-based TENGs themselves as self-powered sensors.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WOOD SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{372-383}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Off-axis tensile creep tests were conducted on woods taken from Japanese
   cypress and Kalopanax by changing the angle of load to the grain
   direction in the longitudinal-tangential (LT) plane. The dependence of
   the Poisson's ratio and trend of the viscoelastic Poisson's ratio on
   grain angle were investigated. The Poisson's ratios were found to reach
   their extrema when the grain angle was around 30 degrees. Moreover, the
   Poisson's ratio in the LT plane was observed to be negative when the
   grain angle was in the range of 15 degrees-45 degrees. Comparing the
   experimental results with theoretical values obtained from the theory of
   orthotropic elasticity, it was revealed that, although the Poisson's
   ratio reached an extremum in both cases, the specific values did not
   match, especially when the angle was between 15 degrees and 45 degrees.
   Furthermore, the temporal variation of the viscoelastic Poisson's ratio
   was found to depend on the grain angle and the measurement plane. It
   also appeared to be affected by the Poisson's ratio, showing an
   increasing tendency above a specific Poisson's ratio (Japanese cypress:
   0.196, Kalopanax: 0.102) and a decreasing tendency below it, regardless
   of the grain angle and measurement plane. Additionally, the increment in
   the viscoelastic Poisson's ratio after 24 h of creep was observed to
   reach its extremum when the grain angle was around 30 degrees. Finally,
   by improving the six-element Frandsen-Muszynski viscoelastic model,
   which simultaneously considers the longitudinal and transverse strains,
   an eight-element model was presented, and the trend of the viscoelastic
   Poisson's ratio was well reproduced by this model.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulations of two three-dimensional hard-body models, hard
   dimers and hard cyclic trimers, were performed in the NpT ensemble. The
   Poisson's ratio was determined for degenerate crystalline phases in both
   systems. In contrast to the results of analogous simulations in
   two-dimensions, positive values were obtained both for the dimers and
   the trimers. However, the Poisson's ratio of the trimers was lower than
   that for the dimers and the latter was lower than that for the spheres.
   This suggests that a negative Poisson's ratio may be obtained for

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{442-452}},

Abstract = {{Stent implantation at a highly curved artery has always been a
   challenge, considering the relatively high chance of in-stent restenosis
   (ISR) caused by severe straightening effect and high strain energy over
   the vessel wall. In this paper, a novel optimization based design method
   was proposed to manipulate the deformation behavior of the common
   ring-and-link stent. By changing the location of the connection point
   between rings and links, traditional ring-and-link structure was
   modified to achiever tunable Poisson's ratio (PR). With the nonuniform
   cellular structure design method proposed in a previous study, PR
   distribution of the stent structure was optimized to achieve the desired
   curvature. As a result, the obtained stent structure with nonuniform PR
   could perfectly fit into the curved artery after expansion, without
   causing any obvious vessel straightening. To validate the proposed
   method, two different vessel models were introduced. Firstly, a short
   vessel with a constant curvature was set as the design objective, and
   both numerical and experimental tests were conducted. Further, a
   patient-specific vessel was applied. Both test results showed that
   optimized stents would cause much smaller vessel straightening.
   Moreover, vessels stented by the optimized structures had much lower
   stress concentration and strain energy. All those properties will
   decrease the possibility of ISR significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Based on micropolar continuum theory, the closed-form stiffness tensor
   of auxetic chiral lattices with V-shaped wings and rotational joints
   were derived. Representative volume element (RVE) of the chiral lattice
   was decomposed into V-shape wings with fourfold symmetry. A unified
   V-beam finite element was developed to reduce the nodal degrees of
   freedoms of the RVE to enable closed-form analytical solutions. The
   elasticity constants were derived as functions of the angle of the
   V-shaped wings, nondimensional in-plane thickness of the ribs, and the
   stiffness of the rotational joints. The influences of these parameters
   on the coupled chiral and auxetic effects were systematically explored.
   The results show that the elastic moduli were significantly influenced
   by all three parameters, while Poisson's ratio was barely influenced by
   the in-plane thickness of the ribs but is sensitive to the angle of the
   V-shaped wings and the stiffness of the rotational springs. There is a
   transition region out of which the spring stiffness does not
   considerably affect the auxeticity and the overall lattice stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{High-performance stretchable strain sensors, particularly those with
   high sensitivity and broad sensing range, are highly important for
   wearable devices. Herein, a novel auxetic bilayer conductive mesh strain
   sensor (ABSS), composed of multi-hardness silicones, is proposed and
   fabricated by the direct ink writing 3D printing and ink spraying
   technique. The bilayer conductive mesh comprises a thin layer of
   high-conductive and crack-prone single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)
   coated on a stretchable carbon-black-doped Ecoflex silicone rubber
   (CB/Ecoflex) mesh. The former serves as the dominant sensing material by
   generating SWCNT cracks in the full strain range, while the latter
   mainly plays the roles of both generating the resistance change and
   maintaining the conductive paths under high strain conditions. The
   presence of high-hardness auxetic frame contributes to the formation of
   longitudinal SWCNT cracks on transverse meshes, enhancing the
   sensitivity of the sensors. It is shown that the synergistic effect of
   the bilayer conductive mesh, strain concentration, and auxetic
   deformation strategy endow ABSS with a high gauge factor (similar to
   13.4) that is 6.6 times larger than that of the common sensor.
   Additionally, this study demonstrates the superior sensing performance
   of the ABSS for wearable applications including swallowing recognition,
   respiration monitoring, and joint movement detection.}},

   increase of the Poissonic effect on the ring size correlates well with
   the Thorpe-Ingold effect. In biprismanes where the CH units in the

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) materials with both auxetic effect and

   effect, namely the material expand laterally under both uniaxial tensile

   both the nearest and the next-nearest interactions. The ferroelasticity
   is stemming from the degeneracy breaking of the 3d-orbitals of Ti atoms

   been deduced, which has been validated to present theoretical
   predictions agreeing well with simulation results. By establishing an
   analytical model, the role of relative density on the energy absorption
   capacity of the 3D re-entrant auxetic structure has been further
   studied. The results indicate that the specific plastic energy
   dissipation is increased by increasing the relative density, while the
   normalized plastic energy dissipation has an opposite sensitivity to the
   relative density when the crushing velocity exceeds the critical
   transition velocity. The study in this work can provide insights into
   the dynamic property of the 3D re-entrant auxetic structure and provides
   an extensive reference for the crushing resistance design of the auxetic
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{The well-known idea of ``structure determines properties{''} can be
   understood profoundly in the case of hexagonal zinc dicyanometalate.
   Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show the uniaxial
   negative thermal expansion (NTE) and negative linear compressibility
   (NLC) properties of Zn{[}Au(CN)(2)](2). The temperature dependence of
   phonon frequencies within the quasi harmonic approximation (QHA) is
   investigated. The abnormal phonon hardening (frequency increase on
   heating) is detected in the ranges of 0-225, 320-345, and 410-430
   cm(-1), which can be indicative of the unusual physical properties of
   Zn{[}Au(CN)(2)](2). Due to the significance of low-energy phonon
   frequencies in Zn{[}Au(CN)(2)](2), in this work, the corresponding
   vibrational mode of the lowest-frequency optical phonon at the zone
   center is analyzed. The specific topology of a springlike framework that
   will produce the effects of a compressed spring on heating and an
   extended spring under hydrostatic pressure is identified and leads to
   the coexistence of uniaxial-NTE and NLC behaviors in Zn{[}Au(CN)(2)](2).
   The. distinguishing phonon group velocity along the a axis and c axis
   facilitates different responses for both the axes under temperature and
   hydrostatic pressure field. Through an analysis and visualization of the
   spatial dependence of elastic tensors, it is found that a negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) is presented in all projection planes due to the
   specific topology.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{84-91}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{The impact response of the re-entrant auxetic honeycomb is studied by
   simulating its in-plane dynamic crushing with FE methods. The
   characteristics of the peculiar crushing patterns and modes in the
   re-entrant honeycomb are described. The energy absorption performances
   of the re-entrant auxetic honeycomb and the hexagonal honeycomb are
   compared. When subjected to the same magnitude of crushing strain, the
   re-entrant honeycomb can dissipate more energy through plastic
   deformation. But if the peak stress is the primary concern for the
   packaging material, the re-entrant structure tends to generate higher
   stress in order to dissipate the same amount of impact energy. Moreover,
   the structural irregularity of the re-entrant auxetic honeycomb is
   defined and its influence on the dynamic crushing is studied. Unlike the
   hexagonal honeycomb, the irregular re-entrant auxetic honeycomb can
   absorb more energy than the regular one in the quasi-static regime. This
   situation reverses under high speed impact. This study will help to
   understand the dynamic behavior of the re-entrant foam and provide
   references for its application. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   an isolated true surface wave (ITSW). The ITSW manifests itself by a
   deltalike peak in the local density of states and by anomalies in
   reflection coefficients. The phenomenon may be useful in redirecting
   energy and/or information from the bulk to the surface in devices

Abstract = {{Post-buckling behavior of the auxetic (with negative Poisson ratio)
   structures has not been investigated so far, especially for structures
   fabricated from heterogeneous materials. In the present research,
   effects of auxeticity of the materials on uniaxial and biaxial
   post-buckling behaviors of the FGM plates are investigated using the
   exact three-dimensional theory of elasticity, instead of the approximate
   plate theories. Furthermore, influence of the Winkler-type elastic
   foundation on the post-buckling responses of the plate is investigated.
   In this regard, a full compatible C-1-continuous 3D Hermitian element
   that in contrast to the conventional elements, satisfies the stress
   continuity condition at the mutual nodes of the adjacent elements, is
   employed to solve the governing equations of the post-buckling. The full
   Green's strain tensor is employed instead of using the approximate von
   Karman strain-displacement expressions to enable tracing behavior of the
   plate for quite large deformations. The governing system of equations is
   solved by a condensation-based incremental under-relaxation
   Newton-Raphson procedure, due to sensitivity and high numerical
   compliance of the resulting highly non-linear finite element system of
   equations. Furthermore, new criteria are proposed for tracing the
   post-buckling behavior. Results reveal that the elastic foundation
   significantly affects the post-buckling mechanism and deformation
   pattern and post-buckling behavior of the plate is enhanced drastically
   by more negative Poisson's ratios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   the so-called penta-graphene nanotubes (PGNTs). Single-walled PGNT of
   three distinct configurations: (n, 0), and two types of (n, n) (here

   showed Young's modulus values of 680-800 GPa, critical strain of
   18-21\%, ultimate tensile stress of 85-110 GPa, and Poisson's ratio
   values ranging from -0.05 to -0.30 (auxetic behavior). During stretching
   at room temperature, we observed a transition from beta-(n, n) to

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Current designs of artificial metamaterials with giant Poisson's ratios
   proposed microlattices that secrete the transverse displacement
   nonlinearly varies with the longitudinal displacement, and the Poisson's
   ratio depends on the applied strain (i.e., tailorable Poisson's ratio).
   Whereas metamaterials with tailorable Poisson's ratios would find many
   important applications, the design of a metamaterial with a giant
   Poisson's ratio that is constant over all the material deformation range
   has been a major challenge. Here, we develop a new class of
   bimaterial-3D-metamaterials with giant and strain-independent Poisson's
   ratios (i.e., Poisson's ratio is constant over the entire deformation
   range). The unit cell is 3D assembled of hinged-struts. Specially
   designed spherical hinges were utilized to give constant Poisson's
   ratios. This new class of metamaterials has been demonstrated by means
   of experimental and numerical mechanics. 15 material samples were 3D
   printed by Stereolithography (SLA) and tested. We revealed a robust
   anisotropy dependence of the Poisson's ratio. A giant negative Poisson's
   ratio of -16 was obtained utilizing a highly anisotropic unit cell of
   dissimilar materials and stiffnesses. Materials with giant and
   strain-independent Poisson's ratios provide a new class of artificial
   metamaterials, which would be used to optimize the performance of many
   existing devices, e.g., strain amplifiers and gauges.}},

Abstract = {{Low-dimensional materials with high stabilities and outstanding
   mechanical properties are essential for next generation
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The successful synthesis of
   two-dimensional (2D) tungsten nitride makes it a promising candidate for
   the MEMS application. Here, we have confirmed the existence of
   experimentally synthesized W2N3 and predicted three additional new 2D
   monolayer tungsten nitrides: WN2, WN4, and W3N based on extensively
   structural searches by CALYPSO method and first-principle calculations.
   The calculations indicate that the nitrogen-rich WN4 monolayer possesses
   large in-plane negative Poisson ratios attributed to the
   4-fold-coordinated WN4 nu(x) = -0.103 and nu(y) = -0.113, which are
   tetrahedron combined with the strong coupling between the 2p orbitals of
   N and 5d orbitals of W. Our findings not only enrich the family of 2D
   transition metal nitrides with excellent mechanical properties but also
   open avenues for design and synthesis of other novel 2D layered

Title = {{On the Behavior of beta-Cristobalite-like Boron Arsenate when Subjected
   to Uniaxial Loading in Its {[}001] Direction and the Implications on Its
   ``Negative{''} Characteristics}},
Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Abstract = {{Boron arsenate (BAsO4) is a beta-cristobalite-like material, which
   crystallizes in the I4 over bar space group. However, unlike
   beta-cristobalite itself, BAsO4 is well characterized and known to be
   stable and at ambient conditions. This work presents the results of
   extensive density functional theory (DFT)-based simulations aimed at
   elucidating the nanoscale deformations that such crystals undergo when
   subjected to uniaxial tensile and compressive loads along their
   crystallographic {[}001] c-direction. It is shown that such uniaxial
   loading results primarily in intra-tetrahedral deformations rather than
   their tilting/rotations (which causes the auxeticity in the (001)
   plane). Through their analysis in isolation from other modes of
   deformation, this study gives a much better insight into such
   intra-tetrahedral deformations and helps explain better the cause of the
   measured negative linear compressibility in the c-direction at elevated
   pressures, which recently has been attributed to a ``demi wine-rack{''}
   mechanism caused by the same intra-tetrahedral deformations.}},

   Double Arrow-Shaped Auxetic Cores}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The development of both light and strong wood-derived materials is an
   interesting research area, particularly in terms of usability in, e.g.,
   furniture constructions. Honeycomb panels being current industry
   standard are relatively thick (32 mm and 40 mm), thus their
   attractiveness in designing furniture is limited. In a few studies, it
   has been shown that honeycomb panels with paper cores are characterized
   by unsatisfactory mechanical properties, especially when the composite
   thickness is less than 20 mm. From the literature, it is also evident
   that mechanical properties might be improved by introducing auxetic
   features into the core structure. Even though it is a concept with great
   potential, there are a few studies dealing with honeycomb panels with
   auxetic cores made of paper. Furthermore, there is no research on the
   corner joints made from such material. For this reason, the aim of the
   study was to test the bending behavior of the corner adhesive joints
   made of honeycomb panels with double arrow-shaped auxetic cores. Within
   the research, the core cell was adopted based on literature and
   preliminary studies, paper auxetic cores were produced by the use of the
   designed and 3d printed device, and joints stiffness and strength were
   calculated analytically based on the experiment results. Evaluated
   corner joints stiffness, both in compression and tension test, is
   greater for samples made of panels with designed auxetic cores.
   Surprisingly, in the analyzed range of elasticity, it was statistically
   proved that the values of joint stiffness coefficient K did not vary
   significantly between compared joints pairs.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on the application of auxetic metamaterials and structures in
   furniture joints are very limited. However, they have huge potential for
   use in ready-to-assemble furniture. This study aimed to design and
   produce different types of auxetic dowels in 3D printing technology, and
   experimentally and numerically analyze the withdrawal strength of these
   dowels. In the scope of the study, 24 auxetic dowels with different
   types and size of inclusions, different diameter of holes, and a
   non-auxetic reference dowel were designed and produced with appropriate
   muffs. Dowels were 3D printed from polyamide (PA12). Poisson's ratios,
   withdrawal strength, contact pressures, and friction coefficients of
   dowels were determined theoretically by means of numerical analyses and
   real static compression tests. After the pre-production of dowels, the
   dowels with triangular inclusions have not been found to have sufficient
   strength and stiffness. Withdrawal strength of dowels decreased as the
   size of inclusions is decreased, or dowel hole diameter is increased.
   Furthermore, contact pressures and stresses in auxetic dowels were
   considerably lower than non-auxetic dowels under the withdrawal force.}},

Abstract = {{Current stenting solutions commonly employ metal alloys and are
   permanent. This fact has the consequence of diverse long term risks for
   the patients, e.g. Restenosis, late-term stent Thrombosis, etc. One
   possible solution to attenuate these problems is the use of polymer or
   metallic based bioabsorbable stents that tend to be degraded by
   corrosion and completely eliminated after their scaffolding duties are
   fulfilled. Additionally, there is a need to find new ways of deploying
   these devices. A route to fulfill this goal, can be the design of stents
   that eliminate the necessity of balloon expansion and are able to
   self-expand by their own deformation mechanism, for example by
   possessing auxetic behavior. The objective of this study is the modeling
   of a stent that reveals auxetic behavior and is composed by a
   biodegradable material (AZ91D Magnesium alloy), to embrace both recent
   tendencies on stenting designs. It is shown that the defined stent
   modeling is able to expand when stretched (auxetic behavior) and reveals
   a deformation mechanism that may be interesting for further development.
   In conclusion, the combination of both biodegradable and auxetic
   characteristics shown in this study may be a future step in the
   evolution of these medical devices. (C) 2016 Portuguese Society of

Abstract = {{A bivariate distribution, whose marginals are Poisson is developed as a
   product of Poisson marginals with a multiplicative factor. The
   correlation between the two variates can be either positive or negative,

   discrete distribution with negative correlation coefficient. In this
   context, it should be worth noting that the bivariate Poisson
   distribution reported by Teicher (1954), (Campbell (1934), Holgate
   (1964)) has the inherent limitation that the correlation is necessarily
   positive, and hence is not useful in modelling the situations (e.g. in
   biology) involving competition for limited resources where a negative

Volume = {{179}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{A novel class of chiral structures having intersecting ligaments acting
   as the node is presented in this study. Depending on the geometric
   parameters, this arrangement may allow both the ligaments connecting the
   nodes together as well as the ligaments that compose the node itself to
   bend upon the application of a uniaxial force. Hence, such structures
   are capable of deforming through two distinct mechanisms, i.e. bending
   of the ligaments between the nodes and bending of the ligaments in the
   nodes. The novel six ligament (hexa) arrangement, a structure derived
   from the hexachiral, was chosen for the purpose of investigating these
   novel designs. This was studied through the use of finite element
   simulations and mechanical testing of 3D printed specimens. Analysis of
   the results supports the suggestion that a hierarchical deformation
   system exist. The value of the Poisson's ratio was found to be dependent
   on the relative thickness of the respective ligaments.}},

Title = {{Multi-material 3D printed mechanical metamaterials: Rational design of
   elastic properties through spatial distribution of hard and soft phases}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Up until recently, the rational design of mechanical metamaterials has
   usually involved devising geometrical arrangements of
   micro-architectures that deliver unusual properties on the macro-scale.
   A less explored route to rational design is spatially distributing
   materials with different properties within lattice structures to achieve
   the desired mechanical properties. Here, we used computational models
   and advanced multi-material 3D printing techniques to rationally design
   and additively manufacture multi-material cellular solids for which the
   elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio could be independently tailored in
   different (anisotropic) directions. The random assignment of a hard
   phase to originally soft cellular structures with an auxetic, zero
   Poisson's ratio, and conventional designs allowed us to cover broad
   regions of the elastic modulus-Poisson's ratio plane. Patterned designs
   of the hard phase were also used and were found to be effective in the
   independent tuning of the elastic properties. Close inspection of the
   strain distributions associated with the different types of material
   distributions suggests that locally deflected patterns of deformation
   flow and strain localizations are the main underlying mechanisms driving
   the above-mentioned adjustments in the mechanical properties. Published

   behaviour of the two gradient honeycomb configurations is simulated
   using full-scale Finite Elements and Component Mode Synthesis (CMS)
   substructuring. Samples of the gradient honeycombs have been
   manufactured by means of 3D printing techniques, and subjected to modal
   analysis using scanning laser vibrometry. We observe a general good
   comparison between the numerical and the experimental results. A
   numerical parametric analysis shows the effect of the gradient topology
   upon the average mobility and general vibroacoustics response of these

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{Analytical expressions have been developed in which the elastic
   behaviour of the alpha-quartz and alpha-cristobalite molecular
   tetrahedral frameworks of both silica and germania are modelled by
   rotation, or dilation or concurrent rotation and dilation of the
   tetrahedra. Rotation and dilation of the tetrahedra both produce
   negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic behaviour), whereas both positive and
   negative values are possible when these mechanisms act concurrently.
   Concurrent rotation and dilation of the tetrahedra reproduces with
   remarkable accuracy both the positive and negative nu(31) Poisson's
   ratios observed for silica alpha-quartz and alpha-cristobalite,
   respectively, when loaded in the x(3) direction. A parametric fit of the
   concurrent model to the germania alpha-quartz experimental nu(31)
   Poisson's ratio is used to predict nu(31) for germania
   alpha-cristobalite, for which no experimental value exists. This is
   predicted to be +0.007. Strain-dependent nu(31) trends, due to
   concurrent rotation and dilation in the silica structures, are in broad
   agreement with those predicted from pair-potential calculations,
   although significant differences do occur in the absolute values. With
   the model of concurrent dilation and rotation of the tetrahedra we
   predict that an alternative uniaxial stress (sigma(3))-induced phase
   exists for both silica, alpha-quartz and alpha-cristobalite, and
   germania, alpha-cristobalite, having geometries in reasonable agreement
   with beta-quartz and idealized beta-cristobalite, respectively.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{The deep cryogenic temperatures encountered in aerospace present
   significant challenges for the performance of elastic materials in
   spacecraft and related apparatus. Reported elastic carbon or ceramic
   aerogels overcome the low-temperature brittleness in conventional
   elastic polymers. However, complicated fabrication process and high
   costs greatly limited their applications. In this work, super-elasticity
   at a deep cryogenic temperature of covalently crosslinked polyimide (PI)
   aerogels is achieved based on scalable and low-cost directional dimethyl
   sulfoxide crystals assisted freeze gelation and freeze-drying strategy.
   The covalently crosslinked chemical structure, cellular architecture,
   negative Poisson's ratio (-0.2), low volume shrinkage (3.1\%), and
   ultralow density (6.1mg/cm(3)) endow the PI aerogels with an elastic
   compressive strain up to 99\% even in liquid helium (4K), almost zero
   loss of resilience after dramatic thermal shocks (T=569K), and fatigue
   resistance over 5000 times compressive cycles. This work provides a new
   pathway for constructing polymer-based materials with super-elasticity
   at deep cryogenic temperature, demonstrating much promise for extensive
   applications in ongoing and near-future aerospace exploration. The deep
   cryogenic temperatures present significant challenges for the
   performance of elastic materials. Here, the authors present a low
   density covalently crosslinked polyimide (PI) aerogels with
   super-elastic properties at deep cryogenic temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibit interesting mechanical properties. In this
   work, a novel auxetic unit cell was proposed with an aim to improve the
   strength and energy absorption of the auxetic structure constituting
   these unit cells. In the developed unit cell, the vertical member of a
   conventional re-entrant unit cell was replaced by a diamond. The
   corresponding structure was named re-entrant diamond structure.
   Specimens were fabricated using Multi-Jet Fusion (MJF) technique and
   experimentally tested to investigate their mechanical performance under
   uniaxial quasi-static and dynamic compression. Finite element model was
   also developed in ABAQUS/Explicit and validated using experimental
   results. Moreover, in order to improve stiffness of the diamonds, a
   cross-link member was introduced in each diamond. Subsequently, a
   parametric study was conducted to study the influence of diamond angle
   (theta(2)) and length ratio (L-2/L-1) on the deformation mode,
   stress-strain curve, Poisson's ratio, and energy absorption of the
   re-entrant diamond structures with and without cross-links. This study
   revealed that larger diamond angle (theta(2)) and smaller length ratio
   (L-2/L-1) are desirable for high strength. Furthermore, the re-entrant
   diamond structures with and without cross-links were compared with the
   conventional re-entrant and hexagonal honeycombs in terms of strength
   and energy absorption.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents design considerations of an adjustable flexible
   auxetic structure used in soft wearable suits with a Cross Chiral
   Honeycomb (CCH) structure. In order to design a macro-auxetic structure
   with elastic flexibilities in the soft wearable suit, it is important to
   develop an auxetic unit cell with adjustability of stiffness. Airbag
   inflation and deflation mechanisms on the adjustable stiffness pads with
   auxetic foam play key roles in either the protection of the human body
   or the assistance of human motion through the reversible configurations
   of the structure. Periodic cellular structures used in auxetic foam were
   first considered in the field of lightweight construction due to their
   high specific stiffness, damping, and energy absorbing properties. The
   development of new manufacturing processes, especially the development
   of modern 3D-printers, has allowed the creation of 3D auxetic
   structures. Experiments of several specimens were conducted to verify
   mechanical structural characteristics of a CCH structure. Through this
   approach, valid geometric parameters of the macro-auxetic structure used
   in the soft wearable suit could be designated.}},

   finite element (FE) analysis showed that the FE simulation could well
   predict the tensile and impact behaviors of the auxetic fabric. The
   auxetic effect of auxetic fabric structural model is related to the
   angle theta and the long/short rib ratios. The impact resistance of
   auxetic fabric structural model is also related to angle theta and

Abstract = {{We investigate the instability-induced pattern transformations in
   3D-printed soft composites consisting of stiff inclusions and voids
   periodically distributed in a soft matrix. These soft auxetic composites
   are prone to elastic instabilities giving rise to negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) behavior. Upon reaching the instability point, the composite
   microstructure rearranges into a new morphology attaining an NPR regime.
   Remarkably, identical composites canmorph into distinct patterns
   depending on the loading direction. These fully determined
   instability-induced distinct patterns are characterized by significantly
   different NPR behaviors, thus, giving rise to enhanced tunability of the
   composite properties. Finally, we illustrate a potential application of
   these reversible pattern transformations as tunable acoustic-elastic
   metamaterials capable of selectively filtering low frequency ranges

Abstract = {{Impact phenomenon is significant for our lives. It can be encountered in
   many fields. The critical areas are debris impact in space, bird
   striking on aircraft, ballistic and traffic accidents. For preventing
   the effect of impacts, some engineering structures are improved and used
   recently. These structures are used to absorb impact energy by avoiding
   the transfer of the high magnitude of the load which risks human life
   and essential part of vehicles that stems from the impact. For road
   vehicles, crush tubes are used for this purpose. However, they are not
   efficient, so that tube filling materials are used. Integration of
   filling materials to tubular systems shows a positive effect on the
   performance. However, in the case of impact, the impact load crushes the
   filling material, and filling materials expand laterally. This expansion
   pushes the boundary of tubular systems and causes bending moment in
   addition to the uniaxial compressive load at the tubular systems.
   Auxetic materials which expand laterally under tensile loads and shrink
   under compressive loads can prevent this incident. Auxetic materials
   exist in two forms. One of them is a foam form, and the other of them
   are lattices form. In this study, auxetic lattices are crushed with
   quasi-dynamic loads to determine their crush efficiencies. Re-entrant,
   anti-tetrachiral, chiral circular, chiral hexagonal auxetic structures
   are crushed with 10 mm/min velocity. Specific energy absorption (SEA)
   values are calculated for each other and compared.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric elastomers are commonly implemented in adaptive structures
   due to their unique capabilities for real time control of a structure's
   shape, stiffness, and damping. These active polymers are often used in
   applications where actuator control or dynamic tunability are important,
   making an accurate understanding of the viscoelastic behavior critical.
   This challenge is complicated as these elastomers often operate over a
   broad range of deformation rates. Whereas research has demonstrated
   success in applying a nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive model to
   characterize the behavior of Very High Bond (VHB) 4910, robust
   predictions of the viscoelastic response over the entire range of time
   scales is still a significant challenge. An alternative formulation for
   viscoelastic modeling using fractional order calculus has shown
   significant improvement in predictive capabilities. While fractional
   calculus has been explored theoretically in the field of linear
   viscoelasticity, limited experimental validation and statistical
   evaluation of the underlying phenomena have been considered. In the
   present study, predictions across several orders of magnitude in
   deformation rates are validated against data using a single set of model
   parameters. Moreover, we illustrate the fractional order is material
   dependent by running complementary experiments and parameter estimation
   on the elastomer VHB 4949 as well as an auxetic foam. All results are
   statistically validated using Bayesian uncertainty methods to obtain
   posterior densities for the fractional order as well as the hyperelastic
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental study was performed to investigate fracture and impact
   properties of novel Auxetic Kevlar laminated composites. For comparison,
   standard Kevlar woven composites with and without polyurethane treatment
   were also considered in this study. For these three composites, short
   nylon fibers of two different fiber lengths and three different fiber
   densities were flocked between laminates. Vacuum infusion process along
   with optimized compaction was employed to fabricate composites. The
   double cantilever beam configuration was used to investigate the
   fracture properties. The Auxetic Kevlar composites showed a significant
   improvement of 225\% in fracture toughness compared to regular woven
   Kevlar composites. Furthermore, the initiation toughness was increased
   by 577\% with the application of flocking in Auxetic Kevlar. During
   impact testing, the Auxetic Kevlar reinforced composites showed a
   significant reduction in damaged area compared to woven counterpart. On
   the other hand, the reduction in damaged area influenced the reduction
   in impact energy absorption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The wave propagations in the periodic structure composed of auxetic
   star-shaped honeycombs are investigated. The matrix of the periodic
   structure is filled with polymer. The effective material properties of
   the unit cell of the periodic structure such as the Poisson's ratio, the
   Young's modulus, and the shear modulus are varied with different filling
   materials. The finite element method is used to solve the wave
   propagation within the auxetic star-shaped honeycombs. The dispersion
   analysis of the band structures and iso-frequency contour are presented.
   The auxeticity is found to have a significant effect on the wave
   propagation in the honeycomb structure, and the collimation of the
   auxetic star-shaped honeycomb structure is also studied. Effects of
   different types of filling on the wave propagation are also
   investigated. Among three filling types, the outer-filled honeycomb has
   the best self-ollimation effect. The self-collimation of the
   polymerfilled auxetic honeycomb structure presented in this study can be
   applied to various acoustic devices.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the vibration transmissibility behaviour in
   conventional and auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) foams under low and

   conventional open cell PU-PE based blocks using an alternative
   manufacturing process to the one currently used in the mainstream
   literature. The dynamic behaviour of both conventional and auxetic
   porous materials was assessed within the frequency bandwidth 5-500 Hz
   using a base excitation technique with a calibrated seismic mass. The
   foam pads were subjected to white noise broadband excitation at low
   dynamic strain, followed by a sine sweep around the resonance of the
   foam-mass system. The experimental data have been used to perform an
   inverse identification of the nonlinear dependence of the foam
   permeability versus the amplitude and frequency of excitation using a
   single-degree-of-freedom poroelastic vibration model. The auxetic foam
   shows higher dynamic stiffness and enhanced viscous dissipation
   characteristics, in particular when subjected to nonlinear vibration
   loading.}},

Abstract = {{Volume change has become a critical actuation method in robotics.
   However, the need for fluid flow or thermal processes to generate volume
   changes limits the durability, speed, and efficiency of these actuators.
   In this paper, we develop a new electromechanical actuator that
   volumetrically expands. By combining auxetic materials with a servo, we
   produce a simple isotropically expanding actuator that can be modularly
   composed. We discuss the symmetry considerations in selecting an
   appropriate auxetic framework for our actuator, eventually choosing a
   double-layered polyhedral auxetic design. Characterization shows that a
   single actuator can expand in radius to 119\% of the original size and
   generate 90N of force, while maintaining a small package and a speedy
   expansion / contraction cycle. Finally, we demonstrate the modularity of
   our actuators by linking three actuators to create a vertical
   tubecrawling robot. The small package and fast cycle time of our system
   highlight how viable these electromechanical volumetric actuators can be
   as an important actuator modality.}},

Abstract = {{Designing new materials with novel topological properties and reduced
   dimensionality is always desirable for material innovation. Here we
   report the design of a two-dimensional material, namely Be5C2 monolayer
   on the basis of density functional theory computations. In Be5C2
   monolayer, each carbon atom binds with five beryllium atoms in almost
   the same plane, forming a quasi-planar pentacoordinate carbon moiety.
   Be5C2 monolayer appears to have good stability as revealed by its
   moderate cohesive energy, positive phonon modes and high melting point.
   It is the lowest-energy structure with the Be5C2 stoichiometry in
   two-dimensional space and therefore holds some promise to be realized
   experimentally. Be5C2 monolayer is a gapless semiconductor with a
   Dirac-like point in the band structure and also has an unusual negative
   Poisson's ratio. If synthesized, Be5C2 monolayer may find applications
   in electronics and mechanics.}},

Title = {{Design of auxetic plates with only one degree of freedom}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{42}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A continuum elastic plate has infinite degrees of freedom: according to
   the applied loads, it assumes the shape that the minimization of the
   total energy prescribes, in dependence of the material it is made of.
   The possibility to control the shape of a morphing structure is
   receiving an increasing attention in several fields; in this connection,
   if a classical elastic plate is considered, it is not possible, in
   general, to tune the elastic properties of the material in order to
   select, between the infinite deformation modes the plate may have, the
   one desired. We present a prototypical case that tries to satisfy this
   desideratum, opening the way to the systematic design of
   microstructure's geometries to fully control a system's shape
   independently of the applied loads. A novel yet simple architecture for
   thin plates having only one degree of freedom is proposed. The plate is
   realized as a tessellation composed by rigid equal hexagonal tiles
   hinged to each other along the sides, and it can deform in just one way,
   that is, into a predetermined synclastic surface, whatever loads are
   applied to it. Such tessellated plate also has a remarkable auxetic
   behavior in bending, with the ratio between transverse and longitudinal
   curvatures in uniaxial bending reaching values larger than one. Modeling
   assumptions and analysis results, at both the discrete and the continuum
   level, are verified by tests carried out onto additively manufactured
   bi-material specimens, showing that it is possible to design the
   deformed configuration by controlling the hexagons' geometry. The
   proposed architecture for realizing auxetic plates with only one degree
   of freedom is highly scalable and easily manufacturable, and it can find
   applications for auxetic scaffolds, prosthetic stress shields, energy
   harvesters, and wearable devices. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose new classes of correlated Poisson processes
   and correlated weighted Poisson processes on the interval {[}0,1]. which
   generalize the class of weighted Poisson processes defined by
   Balakrishnan and Kozubowski (2008), by incorporating a dependence
   structure between the standard uniform variables used in the
   construction. In this manner, we obtain another process that we refer to
   as correlated weighted Poisson process. Various properties of this
   process such as marginal and joint distributions, stationarity of the
   increments, moments, and the covariance function, are studied. The
   results are then illustrated through some examples, which include
   processes with length-biased Poisson, exponentially weighted Poisson,
   negative binomial, and COM-Poisson distributions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This article is devoted to the study of auxetic properties of Cosserat
   hexagonal lattices composed of finite-sized particles with complex
   connections. The description of complex connections is given; their
   mathematical model is elaborated and the properties are studied. The
   introduction of complex connections enables one varying their structure
   and component parameters. Due to that there arise possibilities for both
   simulation of nonchiral lattices with symmetrical bonds and with a
   chiral microstructure and construction of lattices with desired
   properties. The discrete and micropolar equations of the lattice are
   obtained. As a result, the macroparameters are expressed in terms of the
   lattice microparameters. The dependence of the Poisson's ratio on the
   lattice microparameters is obtained. It allows finding and analyzing
   parameters, for which the lattice possesses auxetic properties. The
   importance of rotational degrees of freedom of particles and chirality
   for the appearance of auxetic properties is shown. For verification, the
   results of the calculation of the Poisson's ratio obtained on the basis
   of theoretically obtained relations are compared with the results of
   numerical simulation of the stretching of the lattice.}},

Title = {{Shape memory response and hierarchical motion capabilities of 4D printed
   auxetic structures}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{103}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{4D printing refers to a novel trend in the field of active materials,
   regarding the employment of additive manufacturing to obtain structures
   presenting inherent complex shapes and shape evolutions under the
   application of proper stimuli. Such a technique is a powerful tool to
   realize auxetic structures with customized architectures and
   programmable/controllable shape change. The present paper proposes 4D
   printed shape memory polymer-based systems with auxetic structure,
   capable of hierarchical motion. The systems were prepared starting from
   a commercial photopolymer by means of stereolithography. The mechanical
   behavior of the systems was characterized in uniaxial tensile tests,
   measuring the strains parallel/perpendicular to the load direction.
   Thanks to a broad glass transition region, the photopolymer displays the
   so-called ``Temperature-Memory Effect{''} (TME), i.e. the possibility to
   tailor the thermal trigger of the Shape-Memory Effect (SME) through the
   deformation temperature. Thermo-mechanical histories were applied to a
   single unit cell to investigate both the overall shape memory response
   and the possibility to undergo multiple combined out-of-plane and
   in-plane motions on the basis of the TME. Obtained results allow
   discussing the effect of deformation temperatures on the thermal region
   triggering the SME and show the possibility to exploit the TME to
   achieve sequential self-deployment of auxetic structures. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Rationally designed meta-biomaterials present unprecedented combinations
   of mechanical, mass transport, and biological properties favorable for
   tissue regeneration. Here we introduce hybrid meta-biomaterials with
   rationally-distributed values of negative (auxetic) and positive
   Poisson's ratios, and use them to design meta-implants that unlike
   conventional implants do not retract from the bone under biomechanical
   loading. We rationally design and additively manufacture six different
   types of meta-biomaterials (three auxetic and three conventional), which
   then serve as the parent materials to six hybrid meta-biomaterials (with
   or without transitional regions). Both single and hybrid
   meta-biomaterials are mechanically tested to reveal their full-field
   strain distribution by digital image correlation. The best-performing
   hybrid meta-biomaterials are then selected for the design of
   meta-implants (hip stems), which are tested under simulated-implantation
   conditions. Full-field strain measurements clearly show that, under
   biomechanical loading, hybrid meta-implants press onto the bone on both
   the medial and lateral sides, thereby improving implant-bone contact and
   potentially implant longevity.}},

Abstract = {{Iron-gallium alloys (known as Galfenol) are one of only a few metal
   alloys known to exhibit large auxetic or negative Poisson's ratio
   behavior. The mechanical properties of Galfenol, including the
   auxeticity, are strongly dependent on the composition of the alloy. This
   research seeks to measure the elastic properties of Galfenol through a
   range of practical compositions in order to create a database as well as
   present trends in the elastic properties. This is achieved through
   tensile testing of single-crystal Galfenol dog-bone-shaped specimens and
   through Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) of small parallelepiped
   samples. The effects of heat treatment were also studied. This project
   will enable future researchers to refer to the elastic properties of the
   alloy measured using two different techniques, as well as enable them to
   select the alloy with optimum elastic properties for their applications.}},

   properties using topology optimization approach}},
Journal = {{PHOTONICS AND NANOSTRUCTURES-FUNDAMENTALS AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{43}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the modified SIMP topology optimization (TO) method was
   used, to introduce diverse auxetic unit cells with different volume
   fractions, composing of the symmetric, chiral and re-entrant unit cells.
   The output results suggested that the geometry of the 2D auxetic
   structures were extremely dependent on the values of SIMP method
   parameters, including initial designs and volume fractions. The
   brilliant modes of deformation in the auxetic structures, whose unit
   cells are symmetric, are based on either buckling or bending. To
   validate the TO results, four structures containing symmetric unit cells
   were chosen, called structure 1, 2, 3 and 4. The auxetic structures were
   produced by using 3D printing, with TPU as a hyperelastic material as
   well. Under Compression, the dominating mode of deformation in
   structures 1 and 2 is based on bending, caused by the movement of the
   oblique struts between the unit cells. There is also a linear
   relationship between the vertical and horizontal displacements in
   structure 1, the structure with 50 \% volume fraction and-0.55 Poisson?s
   ratio value. However, the deformation mechanisms in structures 3 and 4
   are based on buckling, called shearing deformation, which is the result
   of the buckling of the vertical struts between the unit cells.}},

Abstract = {{We derive some statistical properties of the distribution of two
   Negative Binomial random variables conditional on their total. This type
   of model can be appropriate for paired count data with Poisson
   over-dispersion such that the variance is a quadratic function of the
   mean. This statistical model is appropriate in many ecological
   applications including comparative fishing studies of two vessels and or
   gears. The parameter of interest is the ratio of pair means. We show
   that the conditional means and variances are different from the more
   commonly used Binomial model with variance adjusted for over-dispersion,
   or the Beta-Binomial model. The conditional Negative Binomial model is
   complicated because it does not eliminate nuisance parameters like in
   the Poisson case. Maximum likelihood estimation with the unconditional
   Negative Binomial model can result in biased estimates of the
   over-dispersion parameter and poor confidence intervals for the ratio of
   means when there are many nuisance parameters. We propose three
   approaches to deal with nuisance parameters in the conditional Negative
   Binomial model. We also study a random effects Binomial model for this
   type of data, and we develop an adjustment to the full-sample Negative
   Binomial profile likelihood to reduce the bias caused by nuisance
   parameters. We use simulations with these methods to examine bias,
   precision, and accuracy of estimators and confidence intervals. We
   conclude that the maximum likelihood method based on the full-sample
   Negative Binomial adjusted profile likelihood produces the best
   statistical inferences for the ratio of means when paired counts have
   Negative Binomial distributions. However, when there is uncertainty
   about the type of Poisson over-dispersion then a Binomial random effects
   model is a good choice.}},

Abstract = {{The issue of energy absorption during impact is present in various
   aspects of life. The possibility of dissipating unwanted energy gives
   huge opportunities for a variety applications such as helmets, car
   bumpers, smart body armours and protective pads. Nevertheless, there are
   numerous technical problems with achieving a compromise between good
   energy absorption efficiency and other important properties such as
   flexibility, weight and thickness. The article describes a study of
   composite structures based on shear thickening fluids (STF) and auxetic
   foams. The composites are developed as a potential component of products
   with high energy absorbing efficiency. The study reports on the
   rheological behavior of STF and force absorbing properties of the
   manufactured composites. In the experiment, two types of STF and eleven
   types of auxetic foams were used. Force absorbing tests for the produced
   samples were performed by dropping an impactor with the energy of 5 J.
   It was proved that the addition of STF to the auxetic foams increases
   the force absorbing efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{When a solid object is stretched, in general, it shrinks transversely.
   However, the abnormal ones are auxetic, which exhibit lateral expansion,
   or negative Poisson ratio. While graphene is a paradigm 2D material,
   surprisingly, graphene converts from normal to auxetic at certain
   strains. Here, we show via molecular dynamics simulations that the
   normal-auxeticity mechanical phase transition only occurs in uniaxial
   tension along the armchair direction or the nearest neighbor direction.
   Such a characteristic persists at temperatures up to 2400 K. Besides
   monolayer, bilayer and multi-layer graphene also possess such a
   normal-auxeticity transition. This unique property could extend the
   applications of graphene to new horizons.}},

Abstract = {{By performing first-principles calculations, a new two-dimensional (2D)
   boron nitride (th-BN) with perfectly ordered arrangements of tetragonal
   and hexagonal rings is predicted to be energetically, dynamically,
   thermally, and mechanically stable. The unique structure endows th-BN
   with anisotropic mechanical, electronic, and optical properties.
   Remarkably, th-BN exhibits exceptional mechanical properties such as
   high in-plane stiffness and sign-tunable Poisson's ratio (PR). The PR of
   th-BN gradually decreases with the increase of axial strain and even
   becomes negative at a very small strain (similar to 2\%), which is
   novel, thereby offering the ability to become non-auxetic, auxetic, and
   partially auxetic 2D nanomaterials depending on the strain rate and
   direction. The structure can withstand tensile strain as large as 36\%,
   and shows ultrahigh ideal strength that can even outperform graphene and
   hexagonal BN. The th-BN is a natural 2D semiconductor with an indirect
   wide band gap of 4.49 eV. The band gap can be tuned by applying lattice
   strain and hydrogenation. The full hydrogenated th-BN exhibits an
   indirect-to-direct band gap transition. The th-BN shows high optical
   absorption in the ultraviolet region. The optical absorption spectrum is
   highly direction-dependent and tunable by strain, suitable for
   high-performance optoelectronic device applications. Furthermore, th-BN
   can be stacked into two different configurations, and are dynamically
   stable and exhibit exotic electronic properties. The desirable direct
   band gap and anisotropic effective mass of the th-C/th-BN
   heterostructure suggest that th-BN can be a suitable substrate for
   tetrahexcarbon.}},

Abstract = {{Various clamp designs have been proposed over the years with different
   degrees of complexity and actual performance vis-a-vis correct grip and
   reduced impact on the surface strains of the tendon sample. The previous
   studies all focused on impact on ultimate tensile strain and Young's
   modulus of the tendons. Here an innovative clamp design is proposed that
   utilizes the fairly recently available technology that is 3D printing to
   produce a made-to-measure tendon sleeve that encloses the sample ends
   and also enables straightforward alignment within the testing equipment.
   All experiments are carried out using the superficial digital flexor
   tendons obtained from pig hind legs. The Young's moduli for the linear
   region of the tendon obtained using this clamp design are very similar
   to those obtained using the cryo Jaw by other researchers for the same
   tendon. Furthermore, negative Poisson's ratios are also obtained for the
   toe-region, in agreement with previous work.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are a family of rationally designed artificial
   structures that have unique effective properties gained from the
   distribution of the internal architecture rather than of the chemical
   composition. This article used the modified solid isotropic material
   with penalization method for topology optimization of 2D re-entrant
   auxetic structures with different Poisson's ratios and volume fractions.
   The obtained structures were verified by the finite-element method (FEM)
   using the commercial FEM software and also validated by the experimental
   approach. A good agreement was achieved between the experimental and
   numerical results. Then, the cell geometry effect on Poisson's ratio
   under large tension was investigated. Our study revealed that the
   location and stiffness of rotation joints are two new parameters
   affecting Poisson's ratio value. Poisson's ratio will decrease by
   decreasing the stiffness of rotation joints and positioning the rotation
   joints closer to the middle of the structure. So, from the investigation
   of the optimizer performance, it was achieved that re-entrant auxetic
   structures with different Poisson's ratios could be easily designed by
   changing just the location of rotation joints. This will be applicable
   in many applications like sensor field.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the first attempt of developing macro-scale auxetic
   structures based on re-entrant hexagon design from braided composite
   materials for civil engineering applications. Braided composite rods
   (BCRs) were produced and arranged as longitudinal and horizontal
   elements to produce three types of auxetic structures: (1) basic
   re-entrant hexagon structure, (2) basic structure modified by adding
   straight longitudinal elements and (3): structure-2 modified by changing
   structural angle. The influence of various material and structural
   parameters as well as structure type on Poisson's ratio and tensile
   properties was thoroughly investigated. The auxetic behaviour was found
   to strongly depend on the structural angle and straight elements,
   resulting in lower auxeticity with lower angles and in presence of
   straight elements. Material parameters influenced the auxetic behaviour
   to a lesser extent and a decrease in auxetic behaviour was noticed with
   increase in core fibre linear density and using stiffer fibres such as
   carbon. The reverse effect was observed in case of tensile strength and
   work of rupture. Among these structures, structure-3 exhibited good
   auxetic behaviour, balanced tensile properties, and high energy
   absorption capacity and their auxetic behaviour could be well predicted
   with the developed analytical model. Therefore, these novel structures
   present good potential for strengthening of civil structures. (C) 2016

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{148}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Graded chiral auxetic cellular metal structures were produced from
   copper alloy powder using Selective Electron Beam Melting (SEBM)
   technique and tested under compressive and shear loading conditions. The
   predesigned geometry of chiral structures has a variable chiral
   amplitude through the length of the specimens, which results in graded
   porosity of the analyzed auxetic structures. The deformation mechanisms
   and mechanical response were evaluated with compression and shear
   testing at two loading velocities. The infrared thermography has been
   used to track the evolution of plastic deformation in the specimens. The
   deformation process under compression loading starts in the area with
   the largest chiral amplitude and then continues through the whole height
   of the specimen. The shear loading shows two significantly different
   groups of responses, which are affected by local defects causing the
   start of failure in different parts of structure. The results of
   experimental testing were further used for validation of developed
   finite element models of chiral structures. The influence of graded
   porosity on the mechanical response of chiral structures was evaluated
   with parametric computational simulations and compared to the non-graded
   structure with constant chiral amplitude and same weight. The non-graded
   auxetic structure offers a stiffer response due to deformation uniformly
   distributed through the height of the specimens but fails abruptly at
   lower strains.}},

Abstract = {{The finite element (FE) method has been used to study the mechanical and
   thermal properties of both conventional and re-entrant (i.e. negative
   Poisson's ratio) honeycombs, which may be used as the cores of sandwich
   panel composites. Failure of the honeycomb structures was simulated
   using a crack propagation method developed in-house. The cell-wall
   stress build up in the conventional honeycomb was calculated to be
   significantly reduced relative to the re-entrant honeycomb under (2D)
   hydrostatic loading, implying that the conventional core will undergo
   significantly less internal damage than the re-entrant core. Conversely,
   the re-entrant honeycomb performs better than the conventional honeycomb
   under thermal loading conditions. The size and pathway of the crack
   formed during the simulation is dependent on the failure stress
   distribution used in the crack propagation routine. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, the ultra-low porous auxetic piezoelectric composite made
   of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and hollow polyvinylidine difluoride
   (PVDF) is first proposed by combining ``additive{''} and
   ``subtractive{''} approaches. The electromechanical properties of the
   auxetic piezoelectric composite are investigated by finite element
   analysis. It is found that the ultra-low porosity in the composite may
   lead to great extensibility along with the excellent figures of merit
   obtained in conventional highly porous piezoelectric ceramics. The small
   amount of additional PVDF can greatly tune the electromechanical
   properties of composite and effectively reduce the maximum stress of
   PZT. To elucidate the role of Poisson's ratio on the electromechanical
   properties of piezoelectric materials, the relationship expressions
   among some electromechanical coefficients are derived. Moreover, the
   semi-empirical expression of ``longitudinal{''} compliance coefficients
   and a simple strategy for predicting some electromechanical coefficients
   are presented to instruct design and application of the ultra-low porous

Abstract = {{This work involves the study of mechanical and antibacterial properties
   of auxetic polyurethane (APU) foams synthesized using castor oil (CO) to
   ascertain their suitability as seat cushions in wheelchairs. Firstly,
   CO-based PU foams (PU-CO) were synthesized by substituting 25\%
   synthetic polyol with CO in a polyol blend. Conventional PU foams and
   PU-CO foams were then converted to auxetic foams using triaxial
   compression and heating. The chemical composition, microstructure and
   thermal, mechanical and antibacterial properties of the foams were
   analyzed. It was found that addition of CO improved the antibacterial
   and mechanical properties of the foams. CO-based APU (CO-APU) foams
   showed highest compression strength and storage modulus. An increase in
   thermal stability of PU-CO was also observed as compared to PU foams.
   These CO-APU foams could be a better alternative to conventional PU
   foams for wheelchair seat cushions and in hospital bed applications. (c)

Title = {{A design framework for gradually stiffer mechanical metamaterial induced
   by negative Poisson's ratio property}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{192}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Gradually stiffer (GS) mechanical metamaterial is a novel kind of
   adaptive structures under nonlinear varying loads for cushioning and
   vibration damping in engineering. These man-made metamaterials in
   applications are usually tailored by trial-and-error. This study
   develops a design framework that integrates the topology optimization,
   parametric design and compression experiment for the GS mechanical
   metamaterials induced by the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) property.
   Firstly, a parametric level set method is incorporated with the
   numerical homogenization method to topologically optimize a series of
   microstructural unit cells with different NPRs. Then, the nonlinear
   static analysis is respectively applied to different unit cells to check
   their GS behavior. Secondly, typical microstructures with GS property
   are selected and simplified to perform the subsequent parametric design
   to analyze the expected property. Thirdly, the obtained mechanical
   metamaterials are fabricated by using the additive manufacturing (AM).
   GS properties of the obtained designs are analyzed and verified by both
   the simulation and compression experiments. Results show that we could
   obtain the GS mechanical metamaterial based on NPR properties for their
   similar characteristics. This study demonstrates that the proposed
   design framework is effective to tailor innovative layouts of the GS
   mechanical metamaterials. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Too many zeros and/or highly skewed? A tutorial on modelling health
   behaviour as count data with Poisson and negative binomial regression}},
Journal = {{HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Dependent variables in health psychology are often counts,
   for example, of a behaviour or number of engagements with an
   intervention. These counts can be very strongly skewed, and/or contain
   large numbers of zeros as well as extreme outliers. For example, `How
   many cigarettes do you smoke on an average day?' The modal answer may be
   zero but may range from 0 to 40+. The same can be true for minutes of
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. For some people, this may be
   near zero, but take on extreme values for someone training for a
   marathon. Typical analytical strategies for this data involve explicit
   (or implied) transformations (smoker v. non-smoker, log
   transformations). However, these data types are `counts' (i.e.
   non-negative whole numbers) or quasi-counts (time is ratio but discrete
   minutes of activity could be analysed as a count), and can be modelled
   using count distributions - including the Poisson and negative binomial
   distribution (and their zero-inflated and hurdle extensions, which
   alloweven more zeros).
   Methods: In this tutorial paper I demonstrate (in R, Jamovi, and SPSS)
   the easy application of these models to health psychology data, and
   their advantages over alternative ways of analysing this type of data
   using two datasets - one highly dispersed dependent variable (number of
   views on YouTube, and another with a large number of zeros (number of
   days on which symptoms were reported over a month).
   Results: The negative binomial distribution had the best fit for the
   overdispersed number of views on YouTube. Negative binomial, and
   zero-inflated negative binomial were both good fits for the symptom data
   with over-abundant zeros.
   Conclusions: In both cases, count distributions provided not just a
   better fit but would lead to different conclusions compared to the
   poorly fitting traditional regression/linear models.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson regression analysis shows the relationship between predictor
   variables and response variables that follow the Poisson distribution
   which has equal dispersion and average values (lambda), a situation
   called equidispersion. However, the variance can also be greater than
   the average value, called overdispersion. This can be caused by excess
   opportunities for the emergence of zero values in the response variable
   or zero excess. The parameter of the overdispersed data analysis can be
   underestimated so that the results become biased. This bias issue can
   be, hopefully, overcome by the Zero Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB)
   regression analysis. In the 2016 Maternal Mortality Rate data in
   Bojonegoro District, overdipersion was overcome by ZINB regression even
   though there was no significant predictor variable found affecting the
   response variable. ZINB regression analysis can also be applied to
   generated data (simulation). We had the data with average lambda = (0.2,
   0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 5.0) proportion of zeros p = (0.4, 0.6, 0.8), and
   the number of observations n = (200,500, 800), with each setting was
   repeated 100 times. From the simulation study it was found that all
   overdispersion events were always accompanied by zero excess events but
   not vice versa. The greater the value of lambda then the greater the
   dispersion coefficient. The ZINB regression is proven to be able to
   overcome overdispersion in various conditions of different values of
   lambda, p, n which can be seen from the value tau (dispersion
   coefficient) after ZINB regression is less than 1 in all conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the mechanical properties of penta-graphene (PG), a
   recently proposed two-dimensional carbon allotrope using atomistic
   simulation techniques combined with the empirical description of
   interatomic interactions. We report on the dependence of its three
   in-plane mechanical moduli (i. e. Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and
   shear modulus) on the deformation direction, strain and temperature. We
   show that PG displays a strongly manifested mechanical anisotropy, being
   characterized by Poisson's ratio and the shear modulus which both depend
   strongly on the deformation direction. By analyzing bond energies we
   study the influence of different carbon-carbon bonds on the mechanical
   response of PG and based on that we explain the origins of the observed
   anisotropy. We show that it is mostly a consequence of the
   characteristics of the sp(3)-hybridizied bonds, which form the
   diamond-like tetrahedral blocks. We investigate the auxeticity of PG in
   detail and show that it displays complete auxetic behavior, having
   negative Poisson's ratio for all the deformation directions. We show
   that the auxeticity of PG is similar to that of defective graphene
   containing 5-8-5 double vacancies, as it also originates from the
   so-called de-wrinkling mechanism. We study the influence of temperature
   and show that it only slightly affects the mechanical moduli of PG. (c)

Abstract = {{Two vertical and orthogonal systematic joint sets are generally arrayed
   in a grid pattern on the bedding surface, which are the significant
   features of flat-lying sandstone terrains. Although extensive researches
   are reported on this topic, many fundamental problems have still not
   been solved. Such mutually perpendicular opening-mode fractures are an
   obvious manifestation of effective tensile stresses in two orthogonal
   directions in the horizontal bedding plane. A good understanding of
   these orthogonal joint systems is a key to structural analysis,
   landscape interpretation, and guidance of resolving a number of very
   practical problems in engineering, mining and hydrologic projects. Based
   on an anatomic investigation on the orthogonal joints in the Potsdam
   sandstone of Cambrian age at Ausable Chasm (New York State, USA) and
   Beauharnois (Quebec, Canada), we proposed that the orthogonal joints may
   result from the auxetic effects of quartz-rich sandstone rather than
   local or regional rotation of the maximum tensile stress (sigma(3))
   direction by about 90 degrees. The sandstone beds with negative
   Poisson's ratios are so fascinating that, when placed under vertical
   burial compression and layer-parallel extension in one direction
   (sigma(3)), it becomes stretched in the transverse direction (sigma(2)),
   producing two orthogonal sets of mutual abutting and intersecting joints
   (J1 and J2 normal to sigma(3) and sigma(2), respectively), and both are
   normal to the bedding surface. Joint set J1 is more closely-spaced than
   J2 by a factor of similar to 3.3, which is correlated with an average
   Poisson's ratio of -0.3 for the Potsdam sandstone at the time of joint
   formation. (C) 2021 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{An innovative auxetic-cored sandwich panel (AXP) is proposed. Its
   perforation resistant performance under high-velocity projectile impact
   was numerically analyzed using the validated finite element simulation
   techniques and compared with that of the aluminum foam-cored sandwich
   panel (AFP) of identical dimensions and weight. It has been found that
   the AXP is far superior to the AFP in ballistic resistance because of
   the material concentration at the impacted area due to the negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect. A parametric study was carried out to
   investigate the effects of several key parameters, including impact
   velocity, face and core thicknesses, and core density, on the ballistic
   resistance of the AXP and AFP. The results show that the ballistic limit
   and perforation energy of the AXP is greatly affected by these
   parameters. Meanwhile, the advantages of AXP over AFP being used as
   ballistic resistant structures are highlighted. The primary outcome of
   this research is new information on the development and design of
   advanced ballistic resistant structures containing auxetic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Unbound aggregate base layers in a quarry haul road in Georgia were
   characterized using embedded sensors and in situ seismic testing. Two
   sections of the road were constructed as inverted pavements, one using a
   South African Roads Board method and the other using a conventional
   Georgia Department of Transportation method. A third was constructed
   using a traditional method. Miniaturized versions of traditional
   cross-hole and downhole seismic tests were conducted to determine the
   stiffnesses of each base layer. Horizontally propagating compression and
   shear waves were measured under four different loading conditions to
   determine Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios of the base. An increase
   in stiffness with an increase in load was measured. Additionally, it was
   found that the Georgia and South Africa sections had similar
   stiffnesses. Surprisingly, the traditional section was found to be
   somewhat stiffer than the other sections. This higher stiffness is
   thought to be caused by a prolonged period of compaction before
   construction of the unbound aggregate base layer, which essentially
   transforms the traditional section into an inverted pavement. Using the
   vertical total normal stresses computed from ILLI-PAVE, a value of 0.3
   for the earth pressure coefficient was found to be reasonable for this
   material in determining the radial total normal stresses. The radial
   effective normal stresses were calculated from the radial total normal
   stresses and experimentally determined pore water pressures.
   Additionally, the negative pore water pressures in the partially
   saturated granular base had a significant impact on the stiffness of the
   unbound aggregate base layer, especially under small load levels.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{3896-3904}},
Abstract = {{Clay-polymer nanocomposites are a new range of particle-filled
   composites possessing enhanced mechanical properties. Transmission
   electron microscopy studies reveal that many single and double clay
   sheets are bent when immersed in the polymer matrix. To understand the
   elastic properties of the sheets we investigate their behaviour under
   compression through molecular dynamics simulations in both aqueous and
   poly(ethylene oxide) environments. We examine the sheets before and
   after buckling and find that the elastic properties of the clay sheets
   are much reduced when buckled in each case. Buckling occurs with only
   small out-of-plane displacement and we ascertain that any observably
   bent sheet will have reduced elastic properties. The sheets possess a
   negative Poisson ratio during buckling, which allows the clay sheet to
   regain its uncompressed area. We present a simple analytical model which
   explains the buckling through the competition between in-plane strain
   energy and out-of-plane displacements. Knowledge of how the elastic
   properties of the clay sheets change with shape is important for the
   design of new nanocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-dilatation theory of elasticity is the simplest special case of
   the micromorphic theory, assuming that the micro-deformation tensor has
   the spherical form. Recently, it was shown that the micro-dilatation
   theory can be efficiently used as the continuum model of cellular
   auxetic metamaterials with re-entrant type lattice structure. Here, we
   provide a further development of this subject and present the results of
   numerical three-dimensional modeling of composite cellular metamaterials
   using the conventional lattice model and the corresponding continuum
   micro-dilatation model. We consider the two-phase metastructures which
   behave like a heterogeneous auxetic material under tension/compression
   and, at the same time, like a homogeneous material under shear. These
   results are achieved due to the absence of coupling between the
   microstructural micro-dilatation effects and the macroscopic shear
   properties of the metamaterial. The positive size effect for the
   apparent Young's modulus of the considered composite structures is
   shown. Additionally, the simple way for the finite-element
   implementation of the micro-dilatation theory in the Comsol system is
   described.}},

Abstract = {{Crash-box is a significant part of automotive passive safety system and
   serves as a main energy absorption device in frontal impact scenario. In
   this paper, a novel crash-box integrating an outer thin-walled tube and
   an inner auxetic cellular core has been designed and comprehensively
   investigated under axial load. The impact simulation of the auxetic
   crash-box has been carried out, and the results show that introduction
   of the auxetic core can improve its energy absorption capacity without
   increasing too much peak impact force. Based on the sensitivity
   analysis, the effects of its geometric parameters on the crashworthiness
   performance have been studied. Finally, collaborative optimization of
   the auxetic crash-box has been performed to simultaneously improve its
   crashworthiness under the low-speed (15 km/h) and high-speed (40 km/h)
   impact cases. In the optimization procedure, the least square support
   vector regression (LS-SVR) method and an improved particle swarm
   optimization (IPSO) algorithm with time-varying coefficients have been
   utilized. The results demonstrate that the optimized crash-box can
   comprehensively improve the energy absorption and impact force
   characteristics effectively. The auxetic crash-box and the collaborative
   optimization approach provide extensive references for the application
   of auxetic structure in vehicle crashworthiness design.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with negative Poisson's ratio are peculiar in that they expand
   laterally when stretched. Examples of such type of behavior have been
   discovered with foams by Lakes (1987); however, it is only recently that
   isotropic materials with negative Poisson's ratio have been shown by
   Milton (1992) to exist within the framework of classical theory of
   elasticity. In this Note, we demonstrate qualitatively that a composite
   material with a reentrant microstructure can also have a negative
   Poisson's ratio, even though the composite may be isotropic owing to a
   completely random distribution of the microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures have become one of the most studied types of cellular
   structure in recent years, thanks to their highly specific mechanical
   properties. Most microstructures are designed with homogeneous
   properties in their main axes; however, in this research, we propose an
   innovative asymmetric 3D auxetic structure based on a 2D configuration
   of cells drawn from the literature. The new auxetic cell is designed by
   topology analysis using classical Timoshenko beam theory. To validate
   the design, samples were constructed by fused filament fabrication with
   ABSplus, and tested under quasi-static compression to determine Young's
   modulus in the three orthogonal directions. The experimental results
   show good agreement with the topological analysis and reveal that the
   proposed cell can transmit a different mechanical behavior to the
   macrostructure in its three orthogonal directions.}},

   Auxetic 3D warp-knitted spacer fabric can be produced by adoption of

   spacer fabric was studied by synchrotron radiation x-ray computed
   tomography (SR-CT). Fiber distribution in the fabric was clearly
   obtained and different types of yarn were extracted separatively. 3D
   image reconstructed by synchrotron radiation X-ray computed tomography
   was consistent with the designed geometrical configuration. Besides, 3D
   model reconstructed lays the foundation for further numerical analysis

   data are compared with the metrology results obtained using a scanning

   enables a predictive approach of the engraving quality depending on the

Abstract = {{Here, we utilize the auxetic concept to improve output electrical power
   and reduce resonance frequency for the piezoelectric vibration energy
   harvesting. An energy harvester consists of a proof mass and two
   supporter beams with piezoelectric patches, is proposed. Presented
   energy harvester prototype is appropriate for applications with limited
   allowable displacement. Three different auxetic structures are proposed
   and their performances are compared to the conventional plain system.
   Finite element (FE) modelling is provided to evaluate these structures
   and optimize their geometrical parameters and electrical resistance to
   achieve the best energy harvesting performance. The FE model is
   validated through experimental tests in which the energy harvesters with
   optimized parameters are excited by an electrodynamic shaker in
   different frequencies. It is shown that the proposed designs are able to
   remarkably enhance the harvested electrical power with respect to the
   plain structure. The experimental tests show that the Auxetic-I, II and
   III could enhance the output electrical power with a magnification
   factor of 10, 6.7 and 6.1 respectively, compared to the conventional
   structure. The resonant working frequency reduced up to 30.45\%, 19.55\%

Abstract = {{Shape memory alloy (SMA) honeycombs are promising new smart materials
   which may be used for light-weight structures, biomedical implants,
   actuators and active structures. In this study, the behavior of several
   SMA honeycomb structures is investigated by means of a continuum-based
   thermomechanically coupled micromechanical analysis. To this end,
   macroscopic inelastic stress strain responses of several topologies are
   investigated, both for pseudoelasticity and for shape memory effect. It
   was found that the triangular topology exhibits the best performance. In
   addition, the initial transformation surfaces are presented for all
   possible combinations of applied in-plane stresses. A special two-phase
   microstructure that is capable of producing an overall negative
   coefficient of thermal expansion is suggested and studied. In this
   configuration, in which one of the phases is a SMA, residual strains are
   being generated upon recovery. Here, the negative coefficient of thermal
   expansion appears to be associated with a larger amount of residual
   strain upon recovery. Furthermore, a two-dimensional SMA re-entrant
   topology that generates a negative inplane Poisson's ratio is analyzed,
   and the effect of the full thermomechanical coupling is examined.
   Finally, the response of a particular three-dimensional microstructure
   is studied.}},

Title = {{Global minimum beryllium hydride sheet with novel negative Poisson's
   ratio: first-principles calculations}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{19432-19436}},
Abstract = {{As one of the most prominent metal-hydrides, beryllium hydride has
   received much attention over the past several decades, since 1978, and
   is considered as an important hydrogen storage material. By reducing the
   dimensionality from 3 to 2, the beryllium hydride monolayer is
   isoelectronic with graphene; thus the existence of its two-dimensional
   (2D) form is theoretically feasible and experimentally expected.
   However, little is known about its 2D form. In this work, by a global
   minimum search with the particle swarm optimization method via density
   functional theory computations, we predicted two new stable structures
   for the beryllium hydride sheets, named -BeH2 and -BeH2 monolayers. Both
   structures have more favorable thermodynamic stability than the recently
   reported planar square form (Nanoscale, 2017, 9, 8740), due to the
   forming of multicenter delocalized Be-H bonds. Utilizing the recently
   developed SSAdNDP method, we revealed that three-center-two-electron
   (3c-2e) delocalized Be-H bonds are formed in the -BeH2 monolayer, while
   for the -BeH2 monolayer, novel four-center-two-electron (4c-2e)
   delocalized bonds are observed in the 2D system for the first time.
   These unique multicenter chemical bonds endow both - and -BeH2 with high
   structural stabilities, which are further confirmed by the absence of
   imaginary modes in their phonon spectra, the favorable formation
   energies comparable to bulk and cluster beryllium hydride, and the high
   mechanical strength. These results indicate the potential for
   experimental synthesis. Furthermore, both - and -BeH2 are wide-bandgap
   semiconductors, in which the -BeH2 has unusual mechanical properties
   with a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.19. If synthesized, it would
   attract interest both in experiment and theory, and be a new member of
   the 2D family isoelectronic with graphene.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Numerous studies proposed the possible use of auxetic periodic
   structures in engineering applications. The regular cellular structures
   with several nodes in a unit cell of the lattice are referred to as
   multilattices. In this work, a homogenization procedure was applied to
   three types of plane multilattices: conventional and re-entrant
   honeycombs (REH), double arrowheads, and semi REH constructed from
   elastic ribs. It was shown, that for all considered lattices the
   components of effective tensors of elasticity can be obtained in an
   explicit way in the frames of the same approach taking stretching,
   bending and shear of the ribs into account. As a result, equivalent
   elastic in-plane properties were found analytically as the functions of
   geometrical parameters of the lattices and the elastic parameters of the
   ribs. The estimation of the limits for the elastic properties was also
   performed. It was investigated how the condition of constant density
   changes the dependence of the elastic constants on the angles between
   the nodes. Also, different lattices were investigated at the same
   reference density taken equal to the density of the honeycomb lattice.
   The most typical cases from the practical point of view were considered
   and the corresponding elastic parameters were calculated for them.}},

   This paper presents estimates of the mechanical properties of the chiral

   that the chiral lattice has a shear stiffitess bound by that of the

Abstract = {{We use ab initio density functional theory (DFT) to elucidate the

   framework (ZIF) materials: ZIF-4 and ZIF-zni, both of which have the
   same chemical composition of Zn(Im)(2) {[}Im = C3H3N2-] and are
   constructed from an identical Zn-Im-Zn basic building block. The CRYSTAL
   code was used to compute the single-crystal elastic constants C-ij of
   the (orthorhombic) ZIF-4 and (tetragonal) ZIF-zni structures at the PBE
   level of theory. Through tensorial analysis of the C-ij, we reveal the
   three-dimensional representation surfaces of the Young's modulus, shear
   modulus, Poisson's ratio and linear compressibility, which enable us to
   describe the detailed elasticity behaviour and to pinpoint basic crystal
   structure-property correlations. Notably, we discover that ZIF-4 can
   potentially exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio, thereby representing the
   first example of an `auxetic-ZIF' to be identified to date. Furthermore,
   we show that our DFT predictions are consistent with recently reported
   experimental measurements of the Young's and bulk moduli of such complex

Abstract = {{Based on density functional theory, the structural and elastic
   properties of InSb1-xBix alloys have been studied using first principle
   calculations. The generalized gradient approximation in the presence of
   spin-orbit coupling is utilized to perform the calculations presented in

   good agreement with the available experimental data. The mechanical
   stability of these alloys is demonstrated using elastic constants. The
   ductility and brittleness of these alloys are investigated using both
   Poisson's ratio and Pugh's ratio. Moreover, the anisotropy of InSb1-xBix
   alloys is studied using the universal index and the 3D representation of
   Young's modulus. According to the obtained values of Poisson's ratio,
   the InSb0.5Bi0.5 and InBi alloys are auxetic materials. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Rock is porous, with a connected network of cracks and pores. The static
   and dynamic behaviors of a rock sample under load depend on both the
   solid mineral matrix and the porous phase. In general, the configuration
   of the pore phase is complex; thus, most studies on the effect of the
   porous phase on rock deformation are conducted numerically and
   theoretical analyses of the constitutive relations are scarce. We have
   studied rock deformation under axially symmetric loading by analyzing a
   model where the pore phase is approximated by rough planes, randomly
   spaced and oriented, extending through the sample. The roughness is
   caused by asperities, all with the same tip radii, but having heights h
   with a probability density distribution given by the negative
   exponential e(-h/lambda) where lambda is a length parameter. Slip at
   contacts under local shear stress is resisted by simple Coulomb
   friction, with friction coefficient f. Both static and dynamic
   deformation were analyzed. The effect of porosity on deformation for
   both modes was found to be given by the nondimensional parameter lambda
   alpha(j), where alpha(j) is the total area of the fault planes per unit
   volume. We demonstrate that stress-induced microfracturing begins as
   randomly oriented microslip throughout the sample. As axial load
   increases, microslip occurs along preferred orientations and locations,
   which finally leads to deformation on a single fault. The model was
   found to fault under static loading conditions-the axial load at
   faulting and the angle of the ``fracture{''} plane agree with values of
   those parameters given by Coulomb's theory of fracture. Dynamic moduli
   and Poisson's ratio are found to be virtually elastic and independent of
   the friction coefficient acting at contacts. The attenuation Q(E)(-1)
   for uniaxial dynamic loading is a strong function of the friction
   coefficient and increases linearly with strain amplitude, in agreement
   with laboratory measurements. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This work investigates the possibility to predict the auxetic behavior
   of composites consisting of non-auxetic phases by means of
   micromechanical models based on Eshelby's inclusion concept. Two
   specific microstructures have been considered: (i) the three-layered
   hollow-cored fibers-reinforced composite and (ii) a microstructure
   imitating the re-entrant honeycomb micro-architecture. The
   micromechanical analysis is based on kinematic integral equations as a
   formal solution of the inhomogeneous material problem. The interaction
   tensors between the inhomogeneities are computed thanks to the Fourier's
   transform. The material anisotropy due to the morphological and
   topological textures of the inhomogeneities was taken into account
   thanks to the multi-site approximation of these tensors. In both cases,
   the numerical results show that auxetic behavior cannot be captured by
   such models at least in the case of elastic and isotropic phases. This
   conclusion is supported by corresponding finite element investigations
   of the second microstructure that indicate that auxetic behavior can be
   recovered by introducing joints between inclusions. Otherwise, favorable
   issues are only expected with auxetic components. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

   Wound Management}},
Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE-JTEHM}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Abstract = {{The design and fabrication of a wound healing device for chronic wounds,
   with multiple functions for controlled drug delivery and exudate
   removal, has been described in this paper. The structural features have
   been machined and modified through laser cutting in a biocompatible
   polymer cast. Miniaturized versions of electronically actuated
   (lead-screw and pulley) mechanisms are used for the specific purpose of
   controlled drug delivery. These mechanisms have been studied and tested,
   being controlled through a microcontroller setup. An auxetic polymeric
   barrier membrane has been used for restricting the drug quantities
   administered. Drug delivery mechanisms are powered wirelessly, through
   an external, active RF component; this communicates with a passive
   component that is buried inside the wound healing device. The exudate
   removal efficiency of the device has been assessed through several
   simple tests using simulated wound exudate. It has been found that
   reasonably precise quantities of drug dosages to be administered to the
   wound site can be controlled through both drug delivery mechanisms;
   however, the lead-screw mechanism provides a better control of auxetic
   barrier membrane actuation and hence controlled drug delivery. We
   propose that this device can have potential clinical significance in
   controlled drug delivery and exudate removal in the management of
   chronic wounds.}},

Abstract = {{The zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model is used to account for
   commonly occurring overdispersion detected in data that are initially
   analyzed under the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model. Tests for
   overdispersion (Wald test, likelihood ratio test {[}LRT], and score
   test) based on ZINB model for use in ZIP regression models have been
   developed. Due to similarity to the ZINB model. we consider the
   zero-inflated generalized Poisson (ZIGP) model as an alternate model for
   overdispersed zero-inflated count data. The score test has an advantage
   over the LRT and the Wald test in that the score test only requires that
   the parameter of interest be estimated under the null hypothesis. This
   paper proposes score tests for overdispersion based on the ZIGP model
   and illustrates that the derived score statistics are exactly the same
   as the score statistics under the ZINB model. A simulation study
   indicates the proposed score statistics are preferred to other tests for
   higher empirical power. In practice, based on the approximate
   mean-variance relationship in the data. the ZINB or ZIGP model can be
   considered, and a formal score test based on asymptotic standard normal
   distribution can be employed for assessing overdispersion in the ZIP
   model. We provide an example to illustrate the procedures for data
   analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{We present a lattice structure defined by patterns of slits that follow
   a rotational symmetry (chiral) configuration. The chiral pattern of the
   slits creates a series of hinges that produce deformation mechanisms for
   the lattice due to bending of the ribs, leading to a marginal negative
   Poisson's ratio. The engineering constants are modeled using theoretical
   and numerical Finite Element simulations. The results are bench-marked
   with experimental data obtained from uniaxial and off-axis tensile
   tests, with an overall excellent agreement. The chiral hinge lattice is
   almost one order of magnitude more compliant than other configurations
   with patterned slits and - in contrast to other chiral micropolar media
   - exhibits an in-plane shear modulus that closely obeys the relation
   between Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in homogeneous isotropic
   linear elastic materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The elasticity anisotropy in the basal atomic planes of Mg(OH)(2) and

   sub-lattice}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{550}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Within the framework of the Hook's generalized law and using the
   experimental data for characteristic crystallographic parameters and
   stiffness constants available from literature, the individual elastic
   properties of constituent octahedral layers and interlayers of the (0 0
   0 1) atomic planes in the Mg(OH)(2) and Ca(OH)(2) crystal lattices are
   theoretically quantified from intermolecular interaction energy. It is
   shown that, under uniaxial type of deformation applied along the (0 0 0
   1) basal planes, in the ``load-deformation response'' the octahedral
   layers and interlayers exhibit the positive and negative Poisson's
   ratio, respectively. Manifestation of such a type strong elastic
   anisotropy in the basal atomic planes and auxetic elastic behavior of
   the hydrogen sub-lattice (interlayers) upon applied uniaxial load result
   from a large difference in the strength of bonding within octahedral
   layers and interlayers. The intermolecular binding energy is contributed
   both by ``hydroxyl-hydroxyl'' and ``metal atom-hydroxyl'' dispersion
   interactions, whereas the Young's modulus in the direction parallel to a
   (0 0 0 1) plane is practically contributed only by the former
   interaction. For this Young's modulus, an approximate analytical
   expression is derived, which is convenient for a physical analysis and
   presumably is also applicable to other metal hydroxides with brucite
   structure. The proposed theoretical model may be extended to hydrostatic
   type loading of metal hydroxides for analysis of the hydrogen associated
   bonding under high-pressure conditions. The approach applied in this
   study to estimate the dispersive energy may be useful in the evaluation
   of the physisorption energy for system ``H-2-metal hydroxide'' in terms
   of the potential application of metal hydroxides as hydrogen storage
   materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Non-linear dynamic behavior of sandwich plates with shape memory alloy
   (SMA) reinforced face sheets and soft auxetic (negative Poisson ratio)
   cores is investigated in the present article. Plates with stiff or
   traditional cores may be regarded as special cases. One of superiorities
   of the present work is considering the localized and instantaneous
   changes of martensite volume fraction of the individual particles of the
   SMA wires, through proposing a constitutive law and a cyclic
   phase-transformation tracing algorithm that are appropriate for pursuing
   the cyclic loading events and the relevant nested hysteretic
   pseudoelastic loops due to the plate vibration. Another novelty is
   incorporation of the core auxeticity and transverse compliance, through
   an efficient global-local layerwise plate theory. An updating iterative
   approach is employed to solve the resulting non-linear time-dependent
   finite element formulation. Results confirm the vibration attenuation
   due to the loss in the stored energy of the plate that is consumed by
   the SMA wires during the phase transformation. Moreover, the auxeticity
   of the core has led to significant stiffening in both the core and plate
   and consequently, reductions in the lateral deflections of the plate.

   led to the change in the shape of the otherwise circular S-cells to the
   elliptical Sshaped structures. The results from the finite element
   simulations of compressive loading on these new structural forms
   indicated improvements in the stress distribution patterns, together

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) foams have been predicted to have unusual
   acoustic properties.  To measure these, polyurethane foam was chosen to
   serve as a model system.  Negative Poisson ratios were produced in open
   cell, reticulated polyurethane foams by heat setting the foam which had
   been three-dimensionally compressed 3.7-fold.  Acoustic reflection
   measurements were made on unconverted foam, NPR uncovered foam, and on
   NPR foam with an unattached and attached cover.  Foams tested had pore
   densities ranging from 25.4 to 254 pores per linear cm.  NPR foams
   absorbed better than unconverted foams at all frequencies.  Smaller
   pore-size NPR foams absorbed sound more efficiently at frequencies above
   630 Hz than did those with larger pores, and those with covers were
   better sound absorbers in the frequency range 250-1000 Hz than the
   uncovered NPR foams.  Unidirectional compression to one quarter of the
   original thickness reduced the Poisson ratio to zero and caused the foam
   to absorb nearly as well as did creation of the negative Poisson's
   ratio.}},

   7075-T651. First, a fatigue life curve and a cyclic curve were
   determined for the standard specimens. A special antibuckling device was
   applied to prevent the bending of the specimens. The same experimental
   arrangement was then applied to determine the low-cycle fatigue life of
   auxetic structures. In the continuation, the most appropriate method was
   selected to calculate the fatigue life on the basis of the measured
   fatigue life curves. Abaqus and SIMULIA fe-safe software were applied
   for this purpose. The best predictions for the standard specimens were

Abstract = {{This study presents the computational analysis for determining the
   fatigue life of two conventional 2D auxetic cellular structures: (i) A
   chiral auxetic structure, (ii) A re-entrant auxetic structure. The
   low-cycle fatigue analysis using a damage initiation and damage
   evolution law was performed, where the needed material parameters were
   obtained previously from the experimentally determined stabilised
   hysteresis loop of inelastic strain energy. The direct cyclic algorithm
   implemented in the Abaqus/Standard software was used for the
   computational analyses to obtain the stabilised response of a model
   subjected to the cyclic loading. In order to examine the damage
   evolution paths, finite elements with severe damage were detected, and
   then removed from the finite element model in the subsequent numerical
   simulations.
   The computational fatigue analyses have shown that the chiral auxetic
   structure demonstrates a higher fatigue strength than the re-entrant
   auxetic structure which is probably due to the fact that, in the chiral
   structure, the stresses are distributed more uniformly along the
   individual cells. To confirm the computational results, the cyclic
   experimental testing has been performed for both auxetic structures. The
   comparison between computational and experimental results shows a
   reasonable agreement.}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Full-scale modeling and nonlinear FEA are presented for large amplitude
   vibration of sandwich plates with functionally graded (FG) auxetic 3D
   lattice core. For the first time, auxetic 3D lattice metamaterials with
   FG configurations along the out-of-plane direction are designed, of
   which the fundamental vibration frequencies are analyzed and verified by
   experiments using 3D printed specimens. Both results suggested that the
   effects of FG configurations and strut incline angles are significant,
   and the FG-X specimen possesses the highest fundamental frequency.
   Subsequently, by means of full-scale nonlinear FE simulations, the large
   amplitude vibration characteristics are investigated for the sandwich
   plates, in which the novel construction of auxetic 3D lattice core with
   three FG configurations along the thickness direction is proposed. And
   the constituent material properties are taken to be
   temperature-dependent. Results revealed that FG configurations have
   distinct effect on the natural frequencies, nonlinear-to-linear
   frequency ratios of sandwich plates, along with EPR-amplitude curves,
   which will become stable when the vibration amplitude is sufficiently
   large.}},

Abstract = {{This present research numerically investigates the energy absorption
   capability of auxetic foam-filled tubes when loaded statically.
   Accordingly, numerical simulations were performed to quantify the
   influence of tubes' parameters such as wall thickness, diameter and
   width on the energy absorption responses and deformation modes of
   auxetic foam-filled circular and square tubes using validated FE models.
   The results reveal that the progressive collapse and deformation mode of
   auxetic foam-filled circular tube are pronouncedly affected by varying
   the tube width, so that the number of lobes created decreases as the
   tube width increases. Moreover, it was found that the absorbed energy by
   auxetic foam-filled square tube shows more dependence on the tube wall
   thickness variations than on the tube width. Nonetheless, increasing the
   width of filled tube makes the structure heavier without considerably
   affecting the absorbed energy, which is undesirable in design of energy
   absorbing structures. The primary outcome of this research is a design
   guideline for the use of auxetic foam as a core for an energy absorber
   device where impact loading is expected.}},

Abstract = {{Since compression-wave velocity V-p and shear-wave velocity V-s are
   affected differently by variation in rock properties and pore fluids,
   seismic amplitude variation with offset (AVO) and multicomponent seismic
   emerges as a key tool for exploration and reservoir evaluation.
   Compression-wave and shear-wave velocities of water-saturated sandstones
   and shales often closely obey a linear relationship, mudrock equation.
   Reflections from the interface of such layers exhibit the well-defined
   background trend of decrease in AVO. Layers with V-p and V-s not
   honoring the mudrock equation are elastically anomalous.
   Hydrocarbon-saturated sands and the carbonate rocks are two of the
   several cases which do not honor the mudrock equation, and therefore,
   their V-p/V-s (Poisson ratio) is different for the same V-p than had
   they been honoring the mudrockline relation. Such layers when interfaced
   with layers honoring the mudrock equation generate the seismic responses
   anomalous to the background AVO response. Low-impedance and low-Poisson
   ration hydrocarbon-saturated sands in clastic regime reflect negative
   amplitudes increasing with offsets (termed as class III AVO anomaly).
   First offshore well in deepwater in Mahanadi Basin was drilled to probe
   the amplitude anomaly showing increase in amplitudes with offsets. Well
   encountered limestone encased in incompacted shale generating increasing
   amplitude with offset. AVO response was computed from well logs to help
   explaining the observed AVO anomaly of increase in amplitudes with
   offset from limestone. Anomaly could not be explained from approximated
   Aki and Richards (Quantitative seismic: theories and methods. W. H.
   Freeman and Company \& Co. New York 1980) relations of Zoeppritz
   equation alone. Angle of incidence approaching critical 40 degrees at
   about offset of 2000 m at shale-limestonetop interface depth caused the
   amplitude to increase with offset. Case study is presented to show how
   such expressions can, prior to drilling, be inferred as generated by
   other than hydrocarbon sands.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the ferroelectric domain-wall induced negative capacitance
   (NC) effect in Metal-FE-Insulator-Metal (MFIM) and
   Metal-FE-Insulator-Semiconductor (MFIS) stacks through phase-field
   simulations by self-consistently solving time-dependent Ginzburg Landau
   equation, Poisson's equation and semiconductor charge equations.
   Considering Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 as the ferroelectric material, we study 180
   degrees ferroelectric domain formation in MFIM and MFIS stacks and their
   polarization switching characteristics. Our analysis signifies that the
   applied voltage-induced polarization switching via soft domain-wall
   displacement exhibits non-hysteretic characteristics. In addition, the
   change in domain-wall energy, due to domain-wall displacement, exhibits
   a long-range interaction and thus, leads to a non-homogeneous effective
   local negative permittivity in the ferroelectric. Such effects yield an
   average negative effective permittivity that further provides an
   enhanced charge response in the MFIM stack, compared to
   Metal-Insulator-Metal. Furthermore, we show that the domain-wall induced
   negative effective permittivity is not an intrinsic property of the
   ferroelectric material and therefore, is dependent on its thickness, the
   gradient energy coefficient and the in-plane permittivity of the
   underlying insulator. Similar to the MFIM stack, MFIS stack also
   exhibits an enhanced charge/capacitance response compared to
   Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) capacitor. Simultaneously, the
   multi-domain state of the ferroelectric induces non-homogeneous
   potential in the underlying insulator and semiconductor layer. At low
   applied voltages, such non-homogeneity leads to the co-existence of
   electrons and holes in an undoped semiconductor. In addition, we show
   that with the ferroelectric layer being in the 180 degrees multi-domain
   state, the minimum potential at the ferroelectric-dielectric interface
   and hence, the minimum surface potential in the semiconductor, does not
   exceed the applied voltage (in-spite of the local differential
   amplification and charge enhancement).}},

Abstract = {{The structural and mechanical properties of gallium oxide films grown on
   silicon crystallographic planes (001), (011), and (111) with a buffer
   layer of silicon carbide are investigated. Nanoindentation was used to
   study the elastoplastic properties of gallium oxide and also to
   determine the elastic recovery parameter of the films under study. The
   tensile strength, hardness, elasticity tensor, compliance tensor,
   Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and other characteristics of gallium
   oxide were calculated using quantum chemistry methods. It was found that
   the gallium oxide crystal is auxetic because, for some stretching
   directions, the Poisson's ratio takes on negative values. The calculated
   values correspond quantitatively to the experimental data. It is
   concluded that the elastoplastic properties of gallium oxide films
   approximately correspond to the properties of bulk crystals and that a
   change in the orientation of the silicon surface leads to a significant
   change in the orientation of gallium oxide.}},

Abstract = {{This paper utilizes the gravity model to analyse German exports. We have
   used a panel dataset which includes German exports to 176 countries and
   20 control variables, including institutional factors during the period
   of 1995-2011. We estimate the model by applying a Poisson regression
   with robust variances and estimate three models (a pooled Poisson
   regression as well as a Exed and random panel data Poisson regression).
   The results reveal that the core economic variables (partner GDP,
   distance) are the most relevant factors behind German exports. The
   distance coefficient is slightly below the average results from other
   studies and thus in comparison German exporters are less harmed by
   geographical distances than exporters in other countries. The real
   exchange rate has also been revealed as relevant: depreciation
   stimulates exports. Other economic significant variables were population
   (negative effect), recession (negative effect) and domestic GDP
   (positive effect). The results of institutional variables are not
   conclusive regarding their effects on exports.}},

Abstract = {{This paper developed a thermal-mechanical analysis model to describe the
   thermal shock behavior of ceramic sandwich structures (CSSs) with an
   auxetic honeycomb core. The transient temperature distribution and the
   associated thermal stress field of CSSs subjected to a thermal shock
   were determined. The crack growth behavior was discussed based on the
   thermal stress intensity factor (TSIF), crack location, face-sheet
   thickness, and internal cell orientation of the honewycomb core in
   detail. The results revealed that the auxetic and nonauxetic honeycomb
   cores have the similar temperature distribution profile however the
   auxetic honeycomb core can substantially reduce the overall thermal
   stress level. Furthermore, by equating the maximum TSIF and equivalent
   fracture toughness, the critical temperature for which the honeycomb
   core can sustain without failure was obtained. The results showed that
   CSSs with auxetic honeycomb core possessed a higher thermal shock
   resistance than that of non-auxetic. This research work was the first
   attempt to identify the the thermal shock resistance of CSSs with an
   auxetic honeycomb core. The results would provide fresh insight into the
   design and selection of CSSs applied in an extreme temperature

Abstract = {{By means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations,
   we designed a new two-dimensional (2D) structure of silicon, namely,
   tetra-silicene. In tetra-silicene, each silicon atom binds with four
   neighboring Si atoms to form a 2D network composed of only tetragons.
   Our DFT computations demonstrate that tetra-silicene is of rather high
   experimental feasibility, as indicated by its considerable cohesive
   energy, all positive modes in the phonon spectrum, and the well
   maintained structure after 10 ps first-principles molecular dynamics
   simulations at 500 K. Tetra-silicene has rather intriguing mechanical
   properties featured with unusual negative Poissons ratios. Remarkably,
   different from hexagonal silicene (hexa-silicene) which is semi-metallic
   without a band gap, tetra-silicene is semiconducting with an appreciable
   indirect band gap of 0.19 eV, and it has a considerable carrier mobility
   of 1639.07 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Encouragingly, our simulations suggest that
   tetra-silicene can be flexibly produced from hexa-silicene via
   mechanical conversion. Once synthesized, tetra-silicene would find many
   important applications in electronics and mechanical devices.}},

Abstract = {{The double V-wing honeycomb can be applied in many fields because of its
   lower mass and higher performance. In this study, the volume, in-plane
   elastic modulus and unit cell area of the double V-wing honeycomb were
   analytically derived, which became parts of the theoretical basis of the
   novel equivalent method. Based on mass, plateau load, in-plane elastic
   modulus, compression strain and energy absorption of the double V-wing
   honeycomb, a novel equivalent method mapping relationship between the
   thickness-width ratio and the basic parameters was established. The
   various size factor of the equivalent honeycomb model was denoted as n
   and constructed by the explicit finite element analysis method. The
   mechanical properties and energy absorption performance for equivalent
   honeycombs were investigated and compared with hexagonal honeycombs
   under dynamic impact. Numerical results showed a well coincidence for
   each honeycomb under dynamic impact before 0.009 s. Honeycombs with the
   same thickness-width ratio had similar mechanical properties and energy
   absorption characteristics. The equivalent method was verified by
   theoretical analysis, finite element analysis and experimental testing.
   Equivalent honeycombs exceeded the initial honeycomb in performance
   efficiency. Improvement of performance and weight loss reached 173.9\%
   and 13.3\% to the initial honeycomb. The double V-wing honeycomb
   possessed stronger impact resistance and better load-bearing capacity
   than the hexagonal honeycomb under impact in this study. The equivalent
   method could be applied to select the optimum honeycomb based on
   requirements and improve the efficiency of the double V-wing honeycomb.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Abstract = {{Recently, auxetic honeycombs have attracted considerable attention for
   their excellent mechanical properties, especially the potential
   applications for energy absorption. In this paper, a novel re-entrant
   auxetic honeycomb is proposed and named as re-entrant star-shaped
   honeycomb (RSH), with the in-plane impact responses explored
   theoretically and numerically. Three types of microstructural
   deformation modes are observed under different impact velocities,
   including low-velocity mode, medium-velocity mode and high-velocity
   mode. Moreover, a deformation map is summarized to illustrate the
   effects of the impact velocity and the relative density on the
   deformation modes. Two typical plateau stress regions are detected under
   low-velocity impact loading, and the second plateau stress is almost
   twice higher than the first one. The transverse contraction of the RSH
   mainly occurs at the first plateau region, which is different for the
   classical re-entrant honeycomb (RH). In addition, the absorbed energy of
   the RSH decreases slightly and then increases with the impact velocity.
   The results of the finite element simulations suggest that the RSH shows
   more excellent impact resistance, compared with the RH and SSH with same
   cell wall thickness. Furthermore, the effects of the cell wall thickness
   and the impact velocity on the crushing strength of the RSH are
   discussed, and the theoretical results are in good agreement with the
   finite element simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the enormous amount of attention CH3NH3PbI3 has received, we are
   still lacking an in-depth understanding of its basic properties. In
   particular, the directional mechanical and structural characteristics of
   this material have remained elusive. Here, we investigate these
   properties by monitoring the propagation of longitudinal and shear
   phonons following the absorption of a femtosecond pulse along various
   crystalline directions of a CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal. We first extract
   the sound velocities of longitudinal and transverse phonons along these
   directions of the crystal. Our study then reveals the negative
   directional thermal expansion of CH3NH3PbI3, which is responsible for
   strong coherent shear phonon generation. Finally, from these
   observations, we perform elastic characterization of this material,
   revealing a large directional Poisson's ratio, which reaches 0.7 and
   that we associate with the weak mechanical stability of this material.
   Our results also provide guidelines to fabricate a transducer of
   high-frequency transverse phonons.}},

   auxetic behaviour}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{111}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic behaviour, the unphysical transverse expansion during uniaxial
   tension, is a common and undesirable feature of classical anisotropic
   hyperelastic constitutive models for soft tissue. In this study we
   uncover the underlying mechanism of such behaviour; high levels of
   in-plane compaction occurs due to increasing tension in
   strain-stiffening fibres, leading to unphysical out-of-plane expansion.
   We demonstrate that auxetic behaviour is primarily influenced by the
   ratio of fibre to matrix stiffness, and is accentuated by
   strain-stiffening fibres in a constant stiffness matrix (e.g., the
   widely used neo-Hookean matrix with exponentially stiffening fibres). We
   propose a new bilinear strain stiffening fibre and matrix (BLFM) model
   which allows close control of the fibre-matrix stiffness ratio, thereby
   robustly eliminating auxetic behaviour. We demonstrate that our model
   provides accurate prediction of experimentally observed outof-plane
   compaction, in addition to stress-stretch anisotropy, for arterial
   tissue subjected to uniaxial tension testing. (C) 2020 Published by

Abstract = {{Semi Reentrant structures, which exhibit zero Poisson's ratio and
   monoclastic curvature, are combinations of hexagonal Honeycomb and
   auxetic Reentrant structures. Deflections and strain analysis based on
   the deformation of unit cells were conducted, and four different
   equivalent theories for predicting the elastic modulus and Poison's
   ratio in two in-plane directions were developed by considering different
   mechanisms, including flexural, stretching, hinging and shearing
   deformations, as well as the influence of cell wall thickness. Single
   sidewall and double sidewall were considered for the cell wall
   thickness. The theoretical models of Semi Reentrant structures cell
   could be obtained by assuming that the deformation is a combination of
   deformation for a hexagonal honeycomb cell (with a positive angle) and a
   Reentrant cell (with a negative angle). The effectiveness and accuracy
   of the four theoretical models for Semi Reentrant structures were
   validated by comparing with the corresponding tensile test simulation
   results via the finite element method. It was indicated that the fourth
   theories (T4) were the most accurate, which include the consideration of
   flexural, stretching, hinging, shearing deformations and cell wall
   thickness. The influence of geometrical parameters (inclined arm length
   l, vertical arm length h, angle alpha, angle beta, structure thickness d
   and cell wall thickness t) on the in-plane tensile properties (elastic
   modulus and stiffness) was also analysed in tensile test simulations via
   the finite element method. Comparison of tension results between Semi
   Reentrant, Reentrant and Honeycomb demonstrated that the mechanical
   properties of Semi Reentrant were combinations between the others.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic properties and Poisson's ratio of the face centered cubic (fcc)
   phases of three systems of particles which interact, respectively,
   through: 1) hard sphere potential (HSP), 2) repulsive Yukawa potential
   (RYP), and 3) hard-core repulsive Yukawa potential (HCRYP), studied by
   Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in the NpT ensemble, are compared in a
   broad range of pressures between melting and close packing. Partial
   auxeticity is observed in each of the considered systems and the role of
   the RYP and HSP, incorporated in HCRYP, is revealed. This study confirms
   intuitive expectations that the elastic properties of the system with
   particles interacting through HCRYP at high pressures are well
   approximated by hard spheres, whereas in the low pressures regime they
   are close to those obtained for the system with pure Yukawa
   interactions. It is also demonstrated that in the ``transition
   region{''}, when the HCRYP system is neither close to RYP nor to HSP
   system, its Poisson's ratio in the directions {[}110]{[}11 over bar 0]
   exceeds the ranges given by RYP and HSP for those directions.}},

Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{By combining the two basic deformation mechanisms for auxetic open-cell
   metamaterials, re-entrant angle and chirality, new hybrid chiral
   mechanical metamaterials are designed and fabricated via a
   multi-material 3D printer. Results from mechanical experiments on the 3D
   printed prototypes and systematic Finite Element (FE) simulations show
   that the new designs can achieve subsequential cell-opening mechanism
   under a very large range of overall strains (2.91\%-52.6\%). Also, the
   effective stiffness, the Poisson's ratio and the cell-opening rate of
   the new designs can be tuned in a wide range by tailoring the two
   independent geometric parameters: the cell size ratio c(0)/b(0), and
   re-entrant angle theta. As an example application, a sequential particle
   release mechanism of the new designs was also systematically explored.
   This mechanism has potential application in drug delivery. The present
   new design concepts can be used to develop new multi-functional smart
   composites, sensors and/or actuators which are responsive to external

Abstract = {{The elastic properties of silica phases are reviewed. Available
   monocrystal data for crystalline SiO2 polymorphs (low-quartz,
   high-quartz, low-cristobalite, high-cristobalite, stishovite) are
   collected from the literature, and effective elastic constants (Young's
   moduli, shear moduli, bulk moduli and Poisson ratios) are calculated
   from these using Voigt-Reuss-Hill averaging. Both experimental data and
   simulation results are taken into account. A table of room temperature
   elastic constants for crystalline silica polymorphs and silica glass is
   given that lists the recommended current ``state-of-the-art{''} values.
   All data are consistent with the well-known auxetic behavior of
   cristobalite at room temperature, and high-temperature simulation data
   published for cristobalite confirm aztxetic behavior for all
   temperatures from room temperature up to more than 1500 degrees C. The
   calculations of this paper show that also quartz can be auxetic, but
   only in a very limited temperature range around the low-to-high-quartz
   transition temperature (420 - 577 degrees C). Experimental measurements
   of elastic properties of tridymite and cristobalite, including

Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{254}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The shear deformation characteristics of a simply supported and
   uniformly loaded regular hexagonal plate is investigated herein,
   including cases when the plate is made from auxetic materials.
   Specifically, the shear correction factor for such a plate is obtained
   by matching its maximum deflections between the Mindlin and Reddy plate
   theories after a convenient Kirchhoff theory model has been proposed.
   Results show that the shear deformation is suppressed if the plate
   material is auxetic; for example, the extent of shear deformation is
   conserved even if the plate thickness is doubled, provided that the
   Poisson's ratio reduces from 0.5 to -1. When benchmarked against other
   plate shapes, the shear deformation for the hexagonal plate is
   comparable with those of square and equilateral triangular plates.
   Therefore, the design principles that incorporate shear deformation in
   thick square plates and in thick equilateral triangular plates can be
   extended to thick hexagonal plates, and this validity applies for both
   conventional and auxetic plate materials.}},

Abstract = {{We describe here the quasi-static crushing behavior of novel classes of

   multiphase structure produced by injecting an alginate hydrogel into the

   auxetic (i.e. negative Poisson's ratio) and non-auxetic metamaterial
   architectures have been 3D printed and subjected to edgewise compression
   crushing loading. A parametric numerical analysis has been also
   performed using validated finite element models to identify best
   metamaterial architecture configurations. Configurations filled with the
   hydrogel showed a significant stabilization of the deformation mechanism
   during large deformation edgewise compression. The use of metamaterials
   designs with internal slots and round in the ribs also filled by
   polyurethane rigid semi-reticulated foam feature however significant
   increases in terms of specific stiffness, mean crushing force, strength

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) normally exists in a gaseous molecular state under
   ambient conditions, while two-dimensional (2D) crystals of CO2 have not
   been reported yet. In this work, based on density functional theory and
   the particle swarm optimization method, we unveil two CO2 2D crystals
   with space groups of P4M2 and Amm2. Our results show that these
   structures have excellent thermal, dynamic, and mechanical stability.
   The new structures are insulators with an indirect or direct band gap,
   while the indirect band gap can be tuned to be direct with small
   uniaxial strains. More importantly, the P4M2 structure has an in-plane
   negative Poisson's ratio, which is due to the interaction of the lattice
   symmetry and the local CO4 tetrahedron symmetry. In addition, the Amm2
   sheet has a very large electronic band gap (>9 eV), which is the largest
   in all known 2D materials. Enthalpy curves indicate that these 2D
   structures may be obtained from the ambient phase of CO2 under high
   pressure. This work presents new structures of CO2, and because of their
   excellent performance in terms of stability, mechanical and electronic
   properties, they potentially have broad applications.}},

Abstract = {{Stretchable energy storage systems are essential for the realization of
   implantable and epidermal electronics. However, high-performance
   stretchable supercapacitors have received less attention because
   currently available processing techniques and material structures are
   too limited to overcome the trade-off relationship among electrical
   conductivity, ion-accessible surface area, and stretchability of
   electrodes. Herein, we introduce novel 2D reentrant cellular structures
   of porous graphene/CNT networks for omni-directionally stretchable
   supercapacitor electrodes. Reentrant structures, with inwardly protruded
   frameworks in porous networks, were fabricated by the radial compression
   of vertically aligned honeycomb-like rGO/CNT networks, which were
   prepared by a directional crystallization method. Unlike typical porous
   graphene structures, the reentrant structure provided structure-assisted
   stretchability, such as accordion and origami structures, to otherwise
   unstretchable materials. The 2D reentrant structures of graphene/CNT
   networks maintained excellent electrical conductivities under biaxial
   stretching conditions and showed a slightly negative or near-zero
   Poisson's ratio over a wide strain range because of their structural
   uniqueness. For practical applications, we fabricated all-solid-state
   supercapacitors based on 2D auxetic structures. A radial compression
   process up to 1/10th densified the electrode, significantly increasing
   the areal and volumetric capacitances of the electrodes. Additionally,
   vertically aligned graphene/CNT networks provided a plentiful surface
   area and induced sufficient ion transport pathways for the electrodes.
   Therefore, they exhibited high gravimetric and areal capacitance values
   of 152.4 F g(-1) and 2.9 F cm(-2), respectively, and had an excellent
   retention ratio of 88\% under a biaxial strain of 100\%. Auxetic
   cellular and vertically aligned structures provide a new strategy for
   the preparation of robust platforms for stretchable energy storage
   electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation on the flexural response of polymer cement
   mortar matrix overlayed or inserted with carbon fibre or auxetic fabric
   layers subject to four levels of rates of loading (1-150 mm/min) is
   reported. Seventy-two specimens made from plain polymer cement mortar,
   composites with auxetic and carbon fibre fabric layers overlayed at the
   bottom and inserted at the mid-depth of the specimens were prepared and
   tested under four point bending. The failure mode including debonding,
   peak load, load-deflection behaviour, longitudinal strain at peak load,
   ultimate stage and energy dissipation are reported. All composite
   specimens exhibited higher peak load, longitudinal strain and energy
   dissipation in comparison to the plain polymer mortar specimens. Auxetic
   fabric composites exhibited increased energy dissipation and
   longitudinal strain at peak load without any sign of debonding. Carbon
   fibre composites, on the other hand, failed due to debonding at a lower
   longitudinal strain. A finite element model is presented to demonstrate
   the debonding tendencies observed in the experiments. Increase in rate
   of loading improved the performance of the auxetic fabric composites but
   reduced the energy dissipation of carbon fibre composites. (C) 2019

Pages = {{19377-19385}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Above their `percolation threshold', intrinsically conducting polymer
   (ICP) based composites exhibit an increase or decrease in conductivity
   with strain. However, in this study we report an increase in
   conductivity and an associated insulator-to-conductor transition
   observed in certain conducting polymer composites below their
   percolation threshold under uniaxial tensile strain, thereby shifting
   the percolation to lower volume fractions. The `auxetic behaviour'
   possible in certain types of ` hierarchical' microstructures is shown to
   be responsible for such changes in the polyaniline (PANI) composites
   studied. Using percolation models, the size and shape of the `conducting
   units' that contribute to the percolation and its changes with strain
   were predicted. These conducting units are secondary and tertiary `
   hierarchical structures' formed by the agglomeration of primary units of
   nano-rods (10 nm). An increase in the aspect ratio of these ` conducting
   units' is necessary for lowering the percolation threshold, which is
   possible in tertiary rod-like assemblies of PANI and not in secondary
   rod-like or platelet-like hierarchical structures. `Auxetic behaviour'
   or a negative Poisson's ratio results in the expansion of the
   agglomerates and increase in the aspect ratio. This demonstrates the
   possibility of ` auxetic behaviour' contributing to changes in
   conductivity, which has not been reported before and could be used for
   novel applications.}},

Abstract = {{In several cases, count data often have excessive number of zero
   outcomes. This zero-inflated phenomenon is a specific cause of
   overdispersion, and zero-inflated Poisson regression model (ZIP) has
   been proposed for accommodating zero-inflated data. However, if the data
   continue to suggest additional overdispersion, zero-inflated negative
   binomial (ZINB) and zero-inflated generalized Poisson (ZIGP) regression
   models have been considered as alternatives. This study proposes the
   score test for testing ZIP regression model against ZIGP alternatives
   and proves that it is equal to the score test for testing ZIP regression
   model against ZINB alternatives. The advantage of using the score test
   over other alternative tests such as likelihood ratio and Wald is that
   the score test can be used to determine whether a more complex model is
   appropriate without fitting the more complex model. Applications of the
   proposed score test on several datasets are also illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the range over which the elasticity of disordered spring
   networks can be manipulated by the removal of selected bonds. By taking
   into account the local response of a bond, we demonstrate that the
   effectiveness of pruning can be improved so that auxetic (i.e., negative
   Poisson's ratio) materials can be designed without the formation of
   cracks even while maintaining the global isotropy of the network. The
   bulk modulus and shear modulus scale with the number of bonds removed
   and we estimate the exponents characterizing these power laws. We also
   find that there are spatial correlation lengths in the change of bulk
   modulus and shear modulus upon removing different bonds that diverge as
   the network approaches the isostatic limit where the excess coordination
   number Delta Z -> 0.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the impact of large pre-deformations applied to
   repetitive 3D network materials on their acoustic properties, and
   especially the tuning of band gaps based on the applied state of
   deformation in the large strains regime. Based on an incremental scheme
   for the computation of the nonlinear mechanical response of periodic
   network materials, we develop a perturbation method of Linstedt-Poincare
   type to predict the evolution of the dispersion relation and phase
   velocity versus the applied deformation and effective density. We focus
   in this contribution on the transition to auxetic like microstructures
   showing negative Poisson's ratio, based on a deformation control. When
   Poisson's ratio becomes negative due to the varying imposed kinematic
   load, we show that some of the analyzed networks become unstable, since
   the strong ellipticity condition is not more satisfied. Such
   instabilities are shown to trigger band gaps associated to
   discontinuities in the phase velocity plots, the range of which
   increases with the slenderness ratio of the beams network. (C) 2017

Title = {{Biomechanical design and analysis of auxetic pedicle screw to resist
   loosening}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{133}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pedicle screws are widely used in fusion surgery, while
   screw loosening often occurrs. An auxetic structures based pedicle screw
   was proposed to improve the bone-screw fixation by radial expansion of
   the screw body under tensile force to resist pulling out. It was
   optimized to obtain excellent anti-pullout ability for a particular bone
   based on the biomechanical interaction between screw and surrounding
   bone.
   Methods: The screw was designed based on re-entrant unit cells. The
   mechanical properties of it were adjusted by the wall thickness (t) and
   re-entrant angle (theta) of the unit cell, and characterized using
   finite element (FE) method. The designed screws were manufactured using
   3D-printing, and Ti6Al4V as the materials. Subsequently, the pullout FE
   models were established, and verified by pulling the fabricated screws
   out of Sawbone blocks. The pulling out processes of screws from bone
   were simulated to explore the optimizing design of the screw.
   Results: The mechanical properties of the screw could be adjusted in a
   wide range. The biomechanical interaction between the screw and bone can
   affect the anti-pullout performance of the screw. With an identical
   elastic modulus (E), better auxiticity of the screw, resulted in a
   better anti-pullout performance; while an appropriate E is the necessary
   condition for its excellent anti-pullout performance for a particular
   bone.
   Conclusion: Appropriate mechanical properties are necessary for the
   auxetic pedicle screw with excellent screwbone fixation performance for
   a particular bone, which can be obtained by rationally designing the
   wall thickness and re-entrant angle of the unit cells.}},

Title = {{Dynamic crushing responses of bio-inspired re-entrant auxetic honeycombs
   under in-plane impact loading}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In order to improve the impact energy absorption abilities and maintain
   good crushing load uniformity of auxetic honeycombs, a re-entrant
   arc-shaped honeycomb (RAH) model is proposed according to the concept of
   bio-inspired structure design. The in-plane impact resistances and
   absorbed-energy characteristics of bio-inspired auxetic RAHs subjected
   to a constant velocity crushing are numerically studied by using
   ABAQUS/EXPLICIT. It is shown that due to the introduction of re-entrant
   arc-shaped structures, the dynamic response curves of bio-inspired RAHs
   have better crushing load uniformity than conventional re-entrant
   honeycombs. Except for the relative density and impact velocity, the
   dynamic crushing behaviors of bio-inspired RAHs also depend upon the
   cell micro-structure parameters (e.g., the curvature). Based on the
   one-dimensional (1D) shock theory and absorbed-energy efficiency method,
   an empirical equation is deduced to evaluate the dynamic plateau stress
   of bio-inspired RAHs. The finite element (FE) results coincide well with
   those calculated by the empirical formulas. Moreover, the specific
   energy absorption (SEA) and energy dissipation rules of bio-inspired
   RAHs are discussed, which are also dependent on the curvature. These
   researches will provide technical support for the innovative structure
   design and dynamic optimization design of auxetic cellular structures.}},

   Structures with Fully Mechanically Controllable Thermal Transports}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{Graphene is considered as an ideal material candidate for
   next-generation electronic devices due to its high carrier mobility
   while the associated thermal management has become a critical barrier.
   Designing graphene whose thermal transport properties can be tuned
   through external fields is highly desired. Here, an auxetic graphene
   (AG) and a contractile graphene (CG) are created and a conceptual design
   of thermal controllable graphene heterostructures is demonstrated by
   tailoring them together. Using computational simulations, it is shown
   that the thermal conductivity of graphene heterostructures can be
   regulated by patterning AG and CG unit cells with different interface
   properties under a uniaxial tensile strain. Analyses of both mechanical
   deformation and vibrational spectra indicate that the thermal transport
   properties of graphene heterostructures are highly dependent on their
   mechanical stress distribution, and also rely on the interfaces that are
   parallel with the directions of mechanical loadings. Theoretical models
   that integrate the contributions of mechanical loading and
   patterned-interfaces are developed to quantitatively describe the
   thermal conductivity of graphene heterostructures. Good agreement of
   thermal conductivity between theoretical predictions and extensive
   simulations is obtained. These designs and findings are expected to pave
   a new route to seek interface-mediated stretchable thermal electronics
   with mechanically controllable performance.}},

Abstract = {{The recent discovery of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in
   two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals has stimulated extensive research
   interest in their intriguing physical properties. Here, via density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal in the family of 2D
   IV-VI semiconductors that an iso-symmetry structure variation concerning
   the switch of the cation (IV) versus anion (VI) in the outermost layers
   leads to the change of sign of Poisson's ratio. Such iso-symmetry
   structural pseudo-phase transition can be induced by external strains,
   as well as electric fields, realizing the possibility of an electrically
   switchable Poisson effect. The phase transition process could involve a
   dynamic intermediate state with an alternative cation/anion switch in
   the frequencies of 2-3 THz according to the real-time time-dependent DFT
   (rt-TDDFT) calculations. The results open the way for studying
   pseudophases in 2D materials associated with sharply different physical
   properties, such as Poisson's ratio, for electromechanical and

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) printing of active materials is a rapidly growing
   research area over the last few years. Numerous works have shown
   potential to revolutionize the field of four-dimensional (4D) printing
   and active self-deploying structures. Conventional manufacturing
   technologies restrict the geometric complexity of active structures. 3D
   printing allows the fabrication of complex active structures with no
   assembly required. In this study, we propose active 3D printed auxetic
   meta-materials that are capable of achieving area changes up to 200\%.
   With these meta-materials, we design geometrically complex active
   structures that can be programmed into versatile shapes and recover
   their original shape given an external stimulus. We simulate the
   proposed metamaterials based on thermoviscoelastic material properties
   obtained by experimental characterization. A reduced beam model is
   constructed to predict forces and deformations of complex active
   structures. Excellent correlation is found between finite element
   simulation and experimental data from a 3-point bending test.
   Rectilinear tiling of the proposed meta-materials achieves the desired
   shape transformation. To demonstrate versatile programming, a selected
   meta-material is tiled into a complex contour, programmed into an
   arbitrary shape, and recovers as predicted. Simulation results verify
   this behavior. Such programmability in conjunction with 3D printing may
   be further exploited for applications such as biomedical devices, civil
   structures, and aerospace.}},

Abstract = {{A sandwich-structured composite is a special class of composite
   materials that is fabricated by attaching two thin but stiff layers to a
   lightweight but thick core. Composites analyzed in this paper consist of
   two different materials: auxetic and structural steel. The optimization
   criterion is minimum compliance for the load case where the frame's top
   boundary is downward loaded. Outer layers are made of steel while the
   middle layer is two-phase solid material composite. Only the middle
   layer is optimized by means of minimization of the objective function
   defined as the internal strain energy. In the first part of this paper
   we study the application of the solid isotropic material with
   penalization (SIMP) model to find the optimal distribution of a given
   amount of materials in sandwich-structured composite. In the second part
   we propose a multilayered composite structure in which internal layers
   surfaces are wavy. In both cases the total energy strain is analyzed.

Title = {{Simulation-based assessment of coupled frequency response of
   magneto-electro-elastic auxetic multifunctional structures subjected to
   various electromagnetic circuits}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART L-JOURNAL OF
   MATERIALS-DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS}},
Abstract = {{This article deals with the modeling of magneto-electro-elastic auxetic
   structures and developing a methodology in COMSOL Multiphysics (R) to
   assess the free vibration response of such structures when subjected to
   various electromagnetic circuit conditions. The triple energy
   interaction between elastic, magnetic, and electric fields are
   established in the COMSOL Multiphysics (R) using structural mechanics
   and electromagnetic modules. The multiphase magneto-electro-elastic
   material with different percentages of piezoelectric and piezomagnetic
   phases are used as the material. In the solid mechanics module, the
   piezoelectric and piezomagnetic materials were created in stress-charge
   and stress-magnetization forms, respectively. The electric and magnetic
   fields are defined in COMSOL Multiphysics (R) through electromagnetic
   equations. Further, the customized controlled meshing constituted of
   free tetrahedral and triangular elements is adapted to trade-off between
   the accuracy and the computational expenses. The eigenvalue analysis is
   performed to obtain the natural frequencies of the MEE re-entrant
   auxetic structures. Also, the efficiency of smart auxetic structures
   over conventional honeycomb structures is presented throughout the
   manuscript. In addition, the discrepancy in the natural frequencies of
   the structures considering coupled and uncoupled state is also
   illustrated. It is believed that the modeling procedure and its outcomes
   serve as benchmark solutions for further design and analysis of smart
   auxetic magneto-electro-elastic structures.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in hyperelastic materials and self-sensing sensor
   designs have enabled the creation of dense compliant sensor networks for
   the cost-effective monitoring of structures. The authors have proposed a
   sensing skin based on soft polymer composites by developing soft
   elastomeric capacitor (SEC) technology that transduces geometric
   variations into a measurable change in capacitance. A limitation of the
   technology is in its low gauge factor and lack of sensing
   directionality. In this paper, we propose a corrugated SEC through
   surface texture, which provides improvements in its performance by
   significantly decreasing its transverse Poisson's ratio, and thus
   improving its sensing directionality and gauge factor. We investigate
   patterns inspired by auxetic structures for enhanced unidirectional
   strain monitoring. Numerical models are constructed and validated to
   evaluate the performance of textured SECs, and to study their
   performance at monitoring strain on animal skin. Results show that the
   auxetic patterns can yield a significant increase in the overall gauge
   factor and decrease the stress experienced by the animal skin, with the
   re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb pattern outperforming all of the other
   patterns.}},

Title = {{Non-affinity in multi-material mechanical metamaterials}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 13}},
Abstract = {{Non-affine deformations enable mechanical metamaterials to achieve their
   unusual properties while imposing implications for their structural
   integrity. The presence of multiple phases with different mechanical
   properties results in additional non-affinity of the deformations, a
   phenomenon that has never been studied before in the area of extremal
   mechanical metamaterials. Here, we studied the degree of non-affinity,
   Gamma, resulting from the random substitution of a fraction of the
   struts, rho(h), that make up a lattice structure and are printed using a
   soft material (elastic modulus = E-s) by those printed using a hard
   material (E-h). Depending on the unit cell angle (i.e., theta = 60
   degrees, 90 degrees, or 120 degrees), the lattice structures exhibited
   negative, near-zero, or positive values of the Poisson's ratio,
   respectively. We found that the auxetic structures exhibit the highest
   levels of non-affinity, followed by the structures with positive and
   near-zero values of the Poisson's ratio. We also observed an increase in
   Gamma with E-h/E-s and rho(h) until E-h/E-s=10(4) and rho(h)=75\%-90\%
   after which Gamma saturated. The dependency of Gamma upon rho(h) was
   therefore found to be highly asymmetric. The positive and negative
   values of the Poisson's ratio were strongly correlated with Gamma.
   Interestingly, achieving extremely high or extremely low values of the
   Poisson's ratio required highly affine deformations. In conclusion, our
   results clearly show the importance of considering non-affinity when
   trying to achieve a specific set of mechanical properties and underscore
   the structural integrity implications in multi-material mechanical
   metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of two geometric refinement strategies widespread in natural
   structures, chirality and self-similar hierarchy, on the in-plane
   elastic response of two-dimensional honeycombs were studied
   systematically. Simple closed-form expressions were derived for the
   elastic moduli of several chiral, anti-chiral, and hierarchical
   honeycombs with hexagon and square based networks. Finite element
   analysis was employed to validate the analytical estimates of the
   elastic moduli. The results were also compared with the numerical and
   experimental data available in the literature. We found that introducing
   a hierarchical refinement increases the Young's modulus of hexagon based
   honeycombs while decreases their shear modulus. For square based
   honeycombs, hierarchy increases the shear modulus while decreasing their
   Young's modulus. Introducing chirality was shown to always decrease the
   Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the structure. However, chirality
   remains the only route to auxeticity. In particular, we found that
   anti-tetra-chiral structures were capable of simultaneously exhibiting
   anisotropy, auxeticity, and remarkably low shear modulus as the
   magnitude of the chirality of the unit cell increases. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) meshes are exposed to predominately tensile
   loading conditions in vivo that can lead to pore collapse by 70-90\%,
   decreasing overall porosity and providing a plausible mechanism for the
   contraction/shrinkage of mesh observed following implantation. To
   prevent pore collapse, we proposed to design synthetic meshes with a
   macrostructure that results in auxetic behavior, the pores expand
   laterally, instead of contracting when loaded. Such behavior can be
   achieved with a range of auxetic structures/geometries. This study
   utilized finite element analysis (FEA) to assess the behavior of mesh
   models with eight auxetic pore geometries subjected to uniaxial loading
   to evaluate their potential to allow for pore expansion while
   simultaneously providing resistance to tensile loading. Overall,
   substituting auxetic geometries for standard pore geometries yielded
   more pore expansion, but often at the expense of increased model
   elongation, with two of the eight auxetics not able to maintain pore
   expansion at higher levels of tension. Meshes with stable pore
   geometries that remain open with loading will afford the ingrowth of
   host tissue into the pores and improved integration of the mesh. Given
   the demonstrated ability of auxetic geometries to allow for pore size
   maintenance (and pore expansion), auxetically designed meshes have the
   potential to significantly impact surgical outcomes and decrease the
   likelihood of major mesh-related complications.}},

Title = {{Robust topological designs for extreme metamaterial micro-structures}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 27}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that the consideration of material uncertainty can
   dramatically impact the optimal topological micro-structural
   configuration of mechanical metamaterials. The robust optimization
   problem is formulated in such a way that it facilitates the emergence of
   extreme mechanical properties of metamaterials. The algorithm is based
   on the bi-directional evolutionary topology optimization and
   energy-based homogenization approach. To simulate additive manufacturing
   uncertainty, combinations of spatial variation of the elastic modulus
   and/or, parametric variation of the Poisson's ratio at the unit cell
   level are considered. Computationally parallel Monte Carlo simulations
   are performed to quantify the effect of input material uncertainty to
   the mechanical properties of interest. Results are shown for four
   configurations of extreme mechanical properties: (1) maximum bulk
   modulus (2) maximum shear modulus (3) minimum negative Poisson's ratio
   (auxetic metamaterial) and (4) maximum equivalent elastic modulus. The
   study illustrates the importance of considering uncertainty for topology
   optimization of metamaterials with extreme mechanical performance. The
   results reveal that robust design leads to improvement in terms of (1)
   optimal mean performance (2) least sensitive design, and (3) elastic
   properties of the metamaterials compared to the corresponding
   deterministic design. Many interesting topological patterns have been
   obtained for guiding the extreme material robust design.}},

   the auxetic chiral lattices}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{238}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the wave propagation properties in terms of the band gap
   and directions of wave propagation of the auxetic chiral structure are
   analyzed. The mechanism of generation of the band gap are carefully
   investigated. The auxetic chiral structure are assembled with the repeat
   unit cells and the unit cell contains a number of rigidly connected
   beams. The dynamic model of the unit cell are established by the
   principle of finite element method. The wave behaviors of the lattices
   are calculated by solving the dynamic model with the help of the Bloch's
   theorem. The band structure are obtained and the effects of the chiral
   angles on the width and position of the band gap distributions are
   carefully studied. Especially, the mechanism of formation of the band
   gap are also analyzed by investigating the vibrational mode calculated
   by the commercial finite element software. The group velocities are
   calculated to analyze the effects of the geometrical parameters on the
   directional frequency-dependent energy flows in the structures. We also
   use the commercial finite element software to simulate the directional
   wave behaviors in the structure. We find that the first mode of the
   elastic wave spread only along certain specific directions in the
   auxetic chiral structure. The speed of wave propagation will be reduced,
   and the direction of wave propagation rotates counterclockwise when the
   chiral angle increases.}},

Abstract = {{Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the fully oxidized
   silicene and germanene with stoichiometric ratio Si:O/Ge:O = 1:1. For
   both compounds, the zigzag ether-like conformation (z-sSiO/z-sGeO) is
   found to be the most energetically favorable structure. These z-sSiO and
   z-sGeO nanosheets have prominent elastic characteristics, which even
   exhibit an unconventional auxetic behavior with negative Poisson ratios.
   After oxidation, the semi-metallic nanosheets are transformed into
   semiconductors with narrow direct band gaps. Due to the anisotropic
   mechanical and electronic properties, the z-sSiO and z-sGeO possess an
   axially high intrinsic charge mobility up to the order of 104 cm2/Vs,
   which is comparable to that of graphene nanoribbons. Our studies
   demonstrate that the silicene and germanene oxides have peculiar

   loads. The specimens, characterized by an overall porosity of 10\%, were
   designed using selected patterns of voids and then fatigue tested to
   estimate the influence of both auxetic and non-auxetic tessellations on
   the mechanical performance. During the loading, detailed deformation
   maps were recorded by means of bi-dimensional Digital Image Correlation
   (DIC). The experimental data collected during this study indicate that
   the use of auxetic patterns could be a strategy to enhance the fatigue
   life of porous structures. In addition, DIC analysis is shown to be an
   excellent non-contact experimental method to assess the cumulative
   damage of the samples and to predict the crack starting points well

   Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Mode structure maps for freely vibrating cylinders over a range of
   Poisson's ratio, nu, are desirable for the design and interpretation of
   experiments using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS). The full range
   of isotropic nu (-1 to +0.5) is analyzed here using a finite element
   method to accommodate materials with a negative Poisson's ratio. The
   fundamental torsional mode has the lowest frequency provided nu is
   between about -0.24 and +0.5. For any nu, the torsional mode can be
   identified utilizing the polarization sensitivity of the shear
   transducers. RUS experimental results for materials with Poisson's ratio
   +0.3, +0.16, and -0.3 and a previous numerical study for nu = 0.33 are
   compared with the present analysis. Interpretation of results is easiest

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{176}},
Pages = {{195-204}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{A contrast in Poisson ratio is a possible strategy to enhance the
   stiffness of composite structures. In solid materials Poisson ratio is
   hardly tailorable unless cellular architectures are considered. Here, we
   first investigated the effect of a single re-entrant inclusion acting as
   a defect into a regular (non-re-entrant) honeycomb lattice. Building on
   this, we generated regular patterns of re-entrant inclusions into a
   regular hexagonal cellular matrix and we characterized the apparent
   stiffness and Poisson ratio of the obtained structures. We also explored
   the role of the intrinsic material properties of the inclusion as well
   as of its closest environment on the interplay between the deformations
   of different phases in the lattice. Our main finding is that a small
   fraction of re-entrant inclusions (around 12\%) is sufficient to
   generate a substantial augmentation in stiffness (300\%) at constant
   overall relative density and without inducing strong anisotropy.
   Eventually, we fabricated by 3D polyjet printing bi-material composite
   architectures to demonstrate the superior mechanical behavior obtained
   exploiting the Poisson effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{SMP-based chiral auxetic mechanical metamaterial with tunable bandgap
   function}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Artificial designed metamaterials have attracted widespread attention
   because of its unique lattice structure and special physical properties.
   In this work, a chiral auxetic metamaterial with adjustable band gap
   function is designed based on the shape memory polymer (SMP) with
   special thermomechanical property. Theory and finite element methods are
   used to investigate the relationship between the elastic modulus,
   Poisson's ratio and lattice parameters of the chiral metamaterial.
   Moreover, the dispersion curves of the metamaterial under different
   strain states and temperature field are studied by finite element
   method. The evolution processes of the band gap with the variation of
   configuration and environmental temperature are systematically revealed.
   The results show that the elastic modulus can be tailored by adjusting
   the geometric parameters of the lattice, and the Poisson's ratio is -1.
   The band gap could be real-time adjusted by external stimuli (mechanical
   loadings, temperature field). Based on the relationship between the
   geometric parameters and the band gap, the required properties of
   metamaterial can be customized. Moreover, the vibration control ability
   of the metamaterial can be further optimized by adjusting the strain of
   metamaterial and the temperature. The method of designing metamaterials
   with tunable and programmable mechanical properties and acoustic
   functions provides a meaningful reference for the development of
   metamaterials with potential applications.}},

   auxetic cores}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{132}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In the present paper, distributions of lateral deflections and in-plane
   normal and transverse shear stresses of circular/annular sandwich plates
   with orthotropic composite face sheets and auxetic (with negative
   Poisson's ratio) cores are determined, for the first time, employing a
   zigzag theory whose results are corrected based on the three-dimensional
   theory of elasticity. The governing equations are developed based on the
   principle of minimum total potential energy and solved using a
   differential transform whose center is located at the outer radius of
   the plate. A comprehensive parametric study including evaluation of
   effects of various geometric and material parameters, lamination
   schemes, and boundary conditions is accomplished. Accuracy of the
   results is verified by results of the 3D theory of elasticity extracted
   from the ABAQUS code. Results reveal that the core auxeticity increases
   the rigidity of the soft core drastically and consequently, decreases
   the lateral deflection of the plate and moderates the interfacial jumps
   in the through-thickness distribution of the transverse shear stress, so
   that a semi-continuous parabolic distribution may be established. The
   core auxeticity may considerably reduce the maximum radial stresses of
   the face sheets and influence of the auxeticity is more remarkable for
   plates with more rigid constructions or boundary conditions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The mechanical behaviour of three different auxetic cellular structures,
   hexa-chiral 2D, tetra-chiral 2D and tetra-chiral 3D, was experimentally
   investigated in this study. The structures were produced with the powder
   bed fusion method (PBF) from an austenitic stainless steel alloy. The
   fundamental material mechanical properties of the sample structures were
   determined with classic quasi-static compressive tests, where the
   deformation process was captured by a high-resolution digital camera.
   The Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) apparatus was used for dynamic
   impact testing at two impact velocities to study the strain-rate
   dependency of the structures. Two synchronised high-speed cameras were
   used to observe the impact tests. The captured images from both
   quasi-static and dynamic experiments were processed using a custom
   digital image correlation (DIC) algorithm to evaluate the
   displacement/strain fields and the Poisson's ratio. Predominant auxetic
   behaviour was observed in all three structures throughout most of the
   deformation process both under quasi-static and impact loading regimes.
   The tetra-chiral 2D structure showed the most significant auxetic
   behaviour. Significant stress enhancement in all tested structures was
   observed in dynamic testing. The Poisson's ratio strain-rate dependency
   was confirmed for all three auxetic structures.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of novel two-dimensional (2D) materials with
   multifunctional properties provides new possibilities for nanoscale
   applications. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we identify
   a class of 2D auxetic materials with a special structural buckling,
   namely, MX2 monolayers (M = Zn, Cd and X = Cl, I). The calculated
   results indicate that four monolayers all exhibit an abnormal negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) with a maximum value of -0.24, which is fairly
   rare in 2D transition metal halides (TMHals). The origin of NPR can be
   explained by the unique local corner-sharing tetrahedral structural
   motif of MX2 monolayers under the low-dimensional effect. More
   importantly, ZnCl2 monolayer can be exfoliated from its bulk counterpart
   with an ultralow exfoliation energy of 8.37 meV angstrom(-2) (0.1341 J
   m(-2)), suggesting the feasibility of its experimental preparation. In
   addition, strain engineering studies on MX2 monolayers show effective
   band gap modulation, indirect-to-direct band gap transitions, and
   significant enhancement of light absorption in the visible and
   near-ultraviolet regions. Our findings enrich the large family of
   versatile 2D TMHals and highlight the promising applications of MX2
   monolayers in nanomechanical and optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Using a global optimization evolutionary algorithm and density
   functional theory calculations we report, for the first time,
   two-dimensional tri-FeB6 as a global minimum ground state structure,
   opening the door for tailoring unique properties by manipulating
   transition metals. This novel tri-FeB6 consists of borophene-like layers
   and an Fe-layer with the Fe-layer being sandwiched between boron planes.
   Its dynamic stability, energetic stability, thermal stability, and
   mechanical stability have been carefully evaluated, suggesting it as a
   quite stable material to call for experimental realization. Furthermore,
   oxidization would retain the planar structural characteristics,
   resulting in an oxide sheet. Both tri-FeB6 and its oxide are found to
   have remarkable mechanical properties. In comparison with experimentally
   fabricated borophene, the in-plane stiffness in tri-FeB6 is greatly
   enhanced, showing the same stiffness as graphene. Oxidization brings
   about unusual negative Poisson's ratio properties, rendering the oxide
   sheet attractive in view of both scientific and technological
   investigations. In addition, both tri-FeB6 and its oxide are
   semiconductors with band gaps of about 2 eV. Furthermore, tensile strain
   can continuously tune the band gaps over a wide range, making tri-FeB6
   and its oxide attractive for advanced nanoelectronics.}},

   normality in Zhang (J R Stat Soc Ser B 64(2):281-294, 2002). The other
   test which is proposed is given explicitly for testing the Poisson, the
   negative binomial or the binomial distributions. It is based on earlier
   work by Gonzalez-Barrios et al. (Metrika 64:77-94, 2006) done for
   distributions within the power series family. This test uses the
   conditional density (probability) of the observed sample, given the
   value of the minimal sufficient statistic. The proposed new test is
   defined as a conditional probabilities ratio, modifying the previous
   criterion. An extensive simulation study to compare the power of the
   proposed new tests with established tests of fit is carried out, using
   alternatives that had been used in previous simulations, for these
   particular distributions. In the study, all tests compared were used
   identifying their exact conditional distribution given the adequate
   sufficient statistic, so no approximations were made by using asymptotic
   distributions and possibly estimates of the unknown parameters present
   in their asymptotic distributions.}},

   solutions, is used to determine elastic deformations of some
   hypothetical, three-dimensional continua of common or auxetic

Abstract = {{Squamous cell carcinoma is usually cancer of the upper oesophagus and is
   very aggressive cancer. The cancer of the cervical oesophagus causes a
   serious complication called dysphagia, which is difficulty in eating or
   swallowing and which is indicative of incurability. Oesophageal stents
   have been used as a relatively better palliative method for patients who
   are suffering from advanced stage squamous cell carcinomas of oesophagus
   and also for the effective relief of dysphagia. There are still problems
   in currently available self-expanding metals and plastic stents, which
   are associated with high rates of early and late complications. This
   research work is aimed to use Auxetic (rotating-squares) geometry for
   the production of a novel Auxetic oesophageal stents and stent-grafts
   relevant to the palliative treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the
   proximal and mid oesophagus and also for the prevention of dysphagia.
   This study also endeavoured to manufacture a significantly small
   diameter Auxetic oesophageal stent and stent-graft. In order to easily
   deploy the Auxetic stent orally using a commercial balloon dilatational
   catheter, and hence it also obviates the need of an expensive dedicated
   delivery system. A novel manufacturing route was employed in this
   research to develop both Auxetic films and Auxetic oesophageal stents,
   which ranged from conventional subtractive techniques to new generative
   manufacturing methods. Polyurethane was selected as a material for the
   fabrication of Auxetic films and Auxetic oesophageal stents because of
   its good biocompatibility and non-toxicological properties. The
   developed Auxetic films were later used for the fabrication of seamed
   Auxetic oesophageal stents. The flexible polyurethane tubular grafts
   were also attached to the inner luminal side of the seamless Auxetic
   oesophageal stents, in order to prevent tumour in-growth. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Oesophageal cancer is the ninth leading cause of malignant cancer death
   and its prognosis remains poor, ranking as the sixth most frequent cause
   of death in the world. This research work aims to adopt an Auxetic
   (rotating-squares) geometry device, that had previously been examined
   theoretically and analysed by Grima and Evans (J Mater Sci Lett
   19(17):1563-1565, 2000), to produce a novel Auxetic oesophageal stent
   and stent-grafts relevant to the palliative treatment of oesophageal
   cancer and also for the prevention of dysphagia. This paper discusses
   the manufacture of a small diameter Auxetic oesophageal stent and
   stent-graft. The oral deployment of such an Auxetic stent would be
   simplest if a commercial balloon dilatational catheter was used as this
   obviates the need for an expensive dedicated delivery system. A novel
   manufacturing route was employed in this research to develop both
   Auxetic films and Auxetic oesophageal stents, which ranged from
   conventional subtractive techniques to a new additive manufacturing
   method. Polyurethane was selected as a material for the fabrication of
   Auxetic films and Auxetic oesophageal stents because of its good
   biocompatibility and non-toxicological properties. The Auxetic films
   were later used for the fabrication of seamed Auxetic oesophageal
   stents. The flexible polyurethane tubular grafts were also attached to
   the inner luminal side of the seamless Auxetic oesophageal stents, in
   order to prevent tumour in-growth. Scanning electron microscopy was used
   to conduct surface morphology study by using different Auxetic specimens
   developed from different conventional and new additive manufacturing
   techniques. Tensile testing of the Auxetic films was performed to
   characterise their mechanical properties. The stent expansion tests of
   the Auxetic stents were done to analyse the longitudinal extension and
   radial expansion of the Auxetic stent at a range of radial pressures
   applied by the balloon catheter, and to also identify the pressure
   values where the Auxetic stent fails. Finite element models of both
   Auxetic film and Auxetic stent were developed, and the results were
   compared with experimental results with a good agreement. The tensile
   testing of the Auxetic polyurethane films revealed that the Poisson's
   ratio of the sample ranged between -0.87 and -0.963 at different
   uniaxial tensile load values. From the stent expansion test, it was
   found that the Auxetic oesophageal stent radially expanded from 0.5 to
   5.73 mm and longitudinally extended from 0.15 to 1.83 mm at a range of
   applied pressure increments (0.5-2.7 bar) from the balloon catheter.}},

Abstract = {{Single-layer delta-As and gamma-P have unique atomic arrangement, which
   belong to the Pmc2(1) and Pbcm space groups, respectively. Because of
   the coupling hinge structure, the physical properties of the two

   mechanical properties of the single-layer delta-As and gamma-P. That is,
   their inherent negative Poisson ratio (NPR) is -0.708 and -0.226,
   respectively. Surprisingly, the absolute value of the NPR of delta-As is
   approximately 26.2 times greater than that of single-layer black
   phosphorus (the NPR of single-layer black phosphorus is -0.027), and
   remains invariant at a certain strain range. Thus, single-layer delta-As
   will have huge potential applications in nanosensors and electronic
   wearable devices due to its invariant and large, negative NPR.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical treatment of a linear elastic isotropic bi-material
   full-space reinforced by an interfacial thin film under axisymmetric
   normal loading is addressed. The thin film is modeled as an extensible
   membrane perfectly bonded to the half-spaces. By virtue of Love's
   potential function and Hankel integral transform, elastic fields of the
   system are explicitly written in the form of semi-infinite line
   integrals. The analytical results are verified by the special cases
   corresponding to the surface stiffened half-space and classical
   bi-material problem. The limiting cases of reinforced homogeneous
   full-space and inextensible membrane are presented and discussed. The
   proposed formulation is also applicable for studying reinforced auxetic
   materials with negative Poisson's ratio. The surface/interface effect on
   the elastic responses of two perfectly bonded half-spaces is also
   simulated by assigning equivalent surface elastic constant to the
   membrane stiffness. Effects of thin film stiffness, material properties,
   loading depth, and surface/interface effect are studied by some
   numerical examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A novel layered topology of auxetic materials based on the tetrachiral
   honeycomb microstructure}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{179}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Microstructured honeycomb materials may exhibit exotic, extreme and
   tailorable mechanical properties, suited for innovative technological
   applications in a variety of modern engineering fields. The paper is
   focused on analysing the directional auxeticity of tetrachiral
   materials, through analytical, numerical and experimental methods.
   Theoretical predictions about the global elastic properties have been
   successfully validated by performing tensile laboratory tests on
   tetrachiral samples, realized with high precision 3D printing
   technologies. Inspired by the kinematic behaviour of the tetrachiral
   material, a newly-design bi-layered topology, referred to as
   bi-tetrachiral material, has been theoretically conceived and
   mechanically modelled. The novel topology virtuously exploits the mutual
   collaboration between two tetrachiral layers with opposite chiralities.
   The bi-tetrachiral material has been verified to outperform the
   tetrachiral material in terms of global Young modulus and, as major
   achievement, to exhibit a remarkable auxetic behaviour. Specifically,
   experimental results, confirmed by parametric analytical and
   computational analyses, have highlighted the effective possibility to
   attain strongly negative Poisson ratios, identified as a peculiar global
   elastic property of the novel bi-layered topology.(c) 2019 The Authors.

   for validation of developed computational models in finite element

Title = {{Mechanical Properties of Auxetic Cellular Material Consisting of
   Re-Entrant Hexagonal Honeycombs}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A preliminary study of the mechanical properties of auxetic cellular
   material consisting of re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs is presented. For
   different scales of the honeycombs, the finite element method (FEM) and
   experimental models are used to perform a parametric analysis on the
   effects of the Poisson's ratio (cell angle) and the relative density
   (cell thickness) of honeycombs on bearing capacity and dynamic
   performance of the auxetic material. The analysis demonstrates that the
   ultimate bearing capacity of the presented auxetic cellular material is
   scale-independent when the Poisson's ratio and the relative density are
   kept constant. The relationship between the geometric parameters and
   vibration level difference of the honeycombs is also revealed, which can
   be divided into two converse parts around the Poisson's ratio v = -1.5.
   When v is smaller than -1.5, increasing the cell thickness leads to an
   increase in the vibration level difference of the honeycombs. Moreover,
   the dynamic performance of thin-walled honeycombs is greatly influenced
   by the scale of the honeycombs, especially for the ones with small
   Poisson's ratio. These conclusions are verified by a frequency response
   test and a good agreement between the numerical results and experimental
   data is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{In last time, the series of virtual internal bond model was proposed for
   solving rock mechanics problems. In these models, the rock continuum is
   considered as a structure of discrete particles connected by normal and
   shear springs (bonds). It is well announced that the normal springs
   structure corresponds to a linear elastic solid with a fixed Poisson
   ratio, namely, 0.25 for threedimensional cases. So the shear springs
   used to represent the diversity of the Poisson ratio. However, the
   shearing force calculation is not rotationally invariant and it produce
   difficulties in application of these models for rock mechanics problems
   with sufficient displacements. In this letter, we proposed the approach
   to support the diversity of the Poisson ratio that based on usage of
   deformable Voronoi cells as set of particles. The edges of dual Delaunay
   tetrahedralization are considered as structure of normal springs
   (bonds). The movements of particle's centers lead to deformation of
   tetrahedrals and as result to deformation of Voronoi cells. For each
   bond, there are the corresponded dual face of some Voronoi cell. We can
   consider the normal bond as some beam and in this case, the appropriate
   face of Voronoi cell will be a cross section of this beam. If during
   deformation the Voronoi face was expand, then, according Poisson effect,
   the length of bond should be decrees. The above mechanism was
   numerically investigated and we shown that it is acceptable for

Abstract = {{Tunable electromagnetic band-gap structures for matching an intended
   band-gap range have more potential for various applications than
   ordinary electromagnetic band-gap structures with a fixed or
   non-linearly variable band-gap range. However, there has not been much
   progress on the study of the appropriate shape of the structure. To
   obtain a controllable and tunable electromagnetic bandgap, we propose a
   new design concept employing a unit-structure with a negative Poisson's
   ratio close to 1 to realize an approximately linear band-gap shift
   according to the variation of the shape of the structure. We used a
   structural optimization procedure based on the phase field method to
   obtain the design of the unit-structure. We investigated the relation
   between the auxetic unit-structure deformation and the change in the
   band-gap range through numerical simulations and also evaluated the
   possibility to realize the design experimentally in the radio frequency
   range. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, a theoretical analysis of auxetic tubular braid (ATB) formed

   the developed model is further corrected based on the real condition and
   thus becomes capable to characterize the auxetic behavior of the ATB.
   During the analysis, it is found that the stiff wrap yarn cannot be
   fully straightened in real condition and its helical angle decreasing
   rate is inconsistent during the stretching. Herein, an effective tool
   for understanding the deformation behavior is provided, which is
   meaningful for the braid's improved design and applications.}},

Abstract = {{The auxetic foams composed of highly porous thermoplastic polyurethane
   (TPU) exhibit an attractive behaviour of withstanding a large volume
   reduction upon the cyclic compressive loading. A family of
   three-dimensional (3D) artificial metamaterials via Bucklicrystals
   consisting of an array of elastomeric spherical shells with periodical
   lattice patterns were proposed to mimic the buckling-induced auxetic
   behaviour as TPU foams. Layer-by-layer deposition of the desirable
   materials to manufacture parts known as additive manufacturing enables
   to create complex geometries and provides the broad freedom in design
   and manufacturing. In this work, selective laser sintering offered a
   unique capability to fabricate tailorable and flexible 3D soft
   metamaterials using TPU powders. An effective method was proposed to
   systematically evaluate the TPU powders and optimize the fabrication
   process, in order to overcome the challenges of sintering the
   duel-segment TPU. The laser-sintered Bucklicrystals were highly
   recoverable undergoing repeated compressions, and they retained the
   auxetic properties over a wide range of applied deformations. The
   fabrication of 3D soft metamaterials is not constrained by existing
   manufacturing principles and the laser-sintered Bucklicrystals of TPU
   are highly valuable to various engineering applications, such as
   mechanical and acoustic energy absorbers, actuators and
   vibration-resistant dampers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider count data modeling, in particular, the zero-truncated case
   as it arises naturally in capture-recapture modeling as the marginal
   distribution of the count of identifications of the members of a target
   population. Whereas in wildlife ecology these distributions are often of
   a well-defined type, this is less the case for social and medical
   science applications since study types are often entirely observational.
   Hence, in these applications, violations of the assumptions underlying
   closed capture-recapture are more likely to occur than in carefully
   designed capture-recapture experiments. As a consequence, the marginal
   count distribution might be rather complex. The purpose of this note is
   to sketch some of the major ideas in the recent developments in ratio
   plotting and ratio regression designed to explore the pattern of the
   distribution underlying the capture process. Ratio plotting and ratio
   regression are based upon considering the ratios of neighboring
   probabilities which can be estimated by ratios of observed frequencies.
   Frequently, these ratios show patterns which can be easily modeled by a
   regression model. The fitted regression model is then used to predict
   the frequency of hidden zero counts. Particular attention is given to
   regression models corresponding to the negative binomial, multiplicative
   binomial and the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution.}},

   parameters of the unit cell and two different loading modes. Finite
   element method was used for the numerical analysis of the problem. A set
   of fully parametric tools has been developed, which enabled automated
   execution and evaluation of virtual experiments. From results of the
   simulations, Young's modulus, the characteristics of the Poisson's ratio
   function, and the deformation energy density were estimated. The
   relation between these characteristics and geometry of the unit cell,
   particularly the re-entrant angle and the relative density, was
   evaluated. Results of the numerical simulations for the unit cell and

Abstract = {{Certain frequency ranges where waves do not propagate, and thus,

   the appearance and the behavior of such areas are investigated on

   piezoelectric elements. The optimal position of the piezoelectric
   patches is found using genetic algorithms, considering the maximization
   of the electromechanical coupling coefficient. A genetic algorithm is
   also used for the calculation of the values of the electrical parameters
   of the resonant shunt circuit, with objective the maximization of
   certain band gaps. The results indicate that the proposed technique can
   be used for the maximization of band gaps at certain frequency ranges,

Abstract = {{Recently published articles have proposed the use of likelihood ratios
   (LRs) in determining the evidential value of finding a given number of
   gunshot residue (GSR) particles on a suspect. LRs depend on the
   probabilistic models assumed for the defence proposition (the suspect
   was not involved in a shooting) and the prosecutor's proposition (the
   suspect was involved), and should be calculated based on data obtained
   in well designed experiments. However, statistical aspects of the
   analysis that select the appropriate model and provide uncertainty
   measures are rarely considered. In this article, data from Cardinetti et
   al. (2006, A proposal for statistical evaluation of the detection of
   gunshot residues on a suspect. Scanning, 28(3): 142-147) are used to
   demonstrate the sensitivity of calculated LRs to the assumed model. It
   is shown that the Poisson model, considered by Cardinetti and others, is
   inappropriate and that a Negative Binomial model fits the data much
   better. The statistical error arising from the fact that models are
   estimated based on small sampled data is discussed, as well as the
   importance of accounting for this error. We conclude that only with a
   large database can statistical models be estimated accurately and LR's
   be treated as valid scientific measures.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic properties of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films were measured
   by a simple method using DLC bridges which are free from the mechanical
   constraints of the substrate. The DLC films were deposited on a Si wafer
   by radio frequency (RF) glow discharge at a deposition pressure of 1.33
   Pa. Because of the high residual compressive stress of the film, the
   bridge exhibited a sinusoidal displacement on removing the substrate
   constraint. By measuring the amplitude with a known bridge length, we
   could determine the strain of the film which occurred by stress
   relaxation. Combined with independent stress measurement using the laser
   reflection method, this method allows the calculation of the biaxial
   elastic modulus, E/(1 - nu), where E is the elastic modulus and nu is
   Poisson's ratio of the DLC film. The biaxial elastic modulus increased
   from 10 to 150 GPa with increasing negative bias voltage from 100 to 550
   V. By comparing the biaxial elastic modulus with the plane-strain
   modulus, E/(1-nu(2)), measured by nano-indentation, we could further
   determine the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio, independently. The
   elastic modulus, E, ranged from 16 to 133 GPa in this range of the
   negative bias voltage. However, large errors were incorporated in the
   calculation of Poisson's ratio due to the pile up of errors in the
   measurements of the elastic properties and the residual compressive
   stress. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.}},

   design for auxetic metamaterials}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{247}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials have demonstrated promising applications in
   crushing energy absorption. This paper proposes cell-wall angle graded
   auxetic metamaterials and investigates the potential benefits to
   in-plane impact resistance by using dynamic finite element analysis. It
   is the first study on enhancing impact resistant ability of auxetic
   metamaterials by using the cell-wall angle graded design. Firstly, the
   effectiveness of this graded design for enhanced energy absorption is
   uncovered and the underlying mechanism is discussed. Then, various
   influencing factors, including impact velocity, magnitude of cell-wall
   angle gradient, cell-wall thickness, are explored in details, and the
   results for the graded structures and uniform structures are compared.
   The experiment testing is also conducted to validate the initial
   simulation model by using a 3D printed specimen of the graded design. It
   is discovered that for the impact with a quasi-static or low velocity,
   the angle graded design could always deliver an enhanced energy
   absorption. Also, with the increase of the impact speed, the enhanced
   energy absorption could only happen when the crushing direction is along
   the structural weak-to-strong direction. The results shed light on a new
   approach to realize the application potential of mechanical
   metamaterials.}},

   performance characteristics we focus is the hydrostatic charge
   coefficient d(h)(({*})). The piezocomposite consists of piezoelectric
   rods embedded in an optimal polymer matrix. In the first approach, we
   allow the material parameters of the polymer matrix to be free design
   variables and we find the polymer parameters which give the optimal
   hydrophone performance. In the second approach, we use the topology
   optimization method to design the optimal (porous) matrix
   microstructure. Using the former approach, we find theoretical bounds
   for hydrophone behavior and using the latter, we design practically
   realizable but less efficient hydrophones. For both approaches, the
   optimal transversally isotropic matrix material has negative Poisson's

   of auxetic hexagonal honeycombs in uni-axial loading, we explore the
   dynamic characteristics of a flexible auxetic hexagonal lattice
   structure when it is used as the flexible spokes of a non-pneumatic
   tire. In this study, a modal analysis and the steady state vibration
   characteristics of NPTs with cellular spokes are investigated with a
   series of vertical loads and rolling speeds using a commercial finite
   element code, ABAQUS/Explicit. The angular velocity and the displacement
   at the hub center and the reaction force on the ground were investigated
   in the time and frequency domains for the steady state rolling condition
   for vehicle speeds of 60km/h and 80km/h. The orthotropic properties of
   the honeycomb spokes create different modal behaviors compared with
   those of pneumatic tires; e.g., the in-plane shear at the initial mode.
   The discrete spoke geometry induces a non-homogeneous mass
   (nonuniformity) distribution, which also causes local vibration effects.}},

   mechanism is optimized to yield prescribed elasticity coefficients. The
   structure is also required to undergo a large overall strain without

   similar structure and a negative Poisson's ratio structure are
   presented. To implement a contact mechanism in the second step, the
   continuum model of a non-contact structure is converted into a frame

   reduce the maximum local strain. The scheme demonstrates that stress

   generation was also seen to occur prior to extrusion with enough fibrils

   generation is proposed which is based on surface melting of the
   particles and drawing out of the interparticle contact points by
   particle movement, which is not necessarily the result of extrusion
   through a die. These findings will aid in the understanding of

Title = {{Can Generalized Poisson model replace any other count data models? An
   evaluation}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Count data represents the number of occurrences of an event
   within a fixed period of time. In count data modelling, overdispersion
   is inevitable. Sometimes, this overdispersion may not be just due to the
   excess zeros but may be due to the presence of two or more mixtures.
   Hence the main objective is to examine for the presence of mixtures if
   any, with excess zeros and compare Generalized Poisson model, Mixture
   models with other count data models using real time and simulated data.
   Methods: Three real time over-dispersed datasets were used for the
   comparison of the models. The real time data models were compared using
   information criteria like AIC and BIC and regression coefficients. Data
   was also simulated using mixture Poisson with excess zeros. The
   simulation was repeated for different sample sizes were used to identify
   the better model.
   Results: Generalized Poisson showed consistently lower bias and MSE when
   compared to the other models for varying sample of sizes. AIC and BIC
   values were almost similar for Generalized Poisson, ZIP and Mixture
   Poisson model. Similar findings were also obtained from real time data.
   Conclusion: Generalized Poisson models provides a better fit for
   overdispersed data due to excess zeros, consistently in real time and
   simulated with varying sample sizes. Negative Binomial models can be
   redistricted or reevaluated against Generalized Poisson model.}},

Abstract = {{Negative-binomial (NB) regression models have been widely used for

Abstract = {{Transformation acoustics opens a new avenue towards the architecture,
   modeling and simulation of a new class of sonic composites with
   scatterers made of various materials and having various shapes embedded
   in an epoxy matrix. The design of acoustic scatterers is based on the
   property of Helmholtz equations to be invariant under a coordinate
   transformation, i.e., a specific spatial compression is equivalent to a
   new material in a new space. In this paper, the noise suppression for a
   wide full band-gap of frequencies is discussed for spherical shell
   scatterers made of auxetic materials (materials with negative Poisson's
   ratio). The original domain consists of spheres made from conventional
   foams with positive Poisson's ratio. The spatial compression is
   controlled by the coordinate transformation, and leads to an equivalent
   domain filled with an auxetic material. The coordinate transformation is
   strongly supported by the manufacturing of auxetics which is based on
   the pore size reduction through radial compression molds. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{A solution for the tension and torsion problems for the curvilinearly
   anisotropic nano/microtubes made of orthorhombic crystals in the
   framework of the Saint-Venant's approach is given. We find that the
   number of partial auxetics among the tubes is twice as. frequent among
   the rectilinearly anisotropic crystals, at the same time about one third
   of 136 orthorhombic crystals are auxetics. It is shown that the torsion
   causes extension of the nano/microtubes even in the absence of a
   longitudinal tensile force. This Poynting's effect substantially depends
   on the chiral angle, and in particular, it disappears when the chiral
   angle vanishes. We also investigate an inverse Poynting's effect when
   the extension of the nano/microtubes is accompanied by their twisting.
   It is shown that the signs of Poynting's effect and Poisson's ratio are
   changed several times with the change of the chiral angle.}},

Abstract = {{Online dictionary learning for sparse coding is an effective tool for
   data analysis. It incrementally learns a set of basis vectors with
   sparse linear combinations of these vectors when new samples appear.
   Previous work assumes that the samples embed Gaussian noises, which
   weaken the power of these methods in handling real applications with
   non-negative data (e.g., frequency data in word counts). Differently, in
   this paper, we concentrate on online learning for non-negative
   dictionary by using moment information for sparse Poisson coding. We
   exploit the non-negativity of Poisson models to learn a set of
   non-negative basis vectors and a non-negative sparse linear combination
   for the moment information of samples. Specifically, we first formulate
   the online learning problem via the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP)
   framework. We then propose a novel online algorithm which alternatively
   updates the sparse-coefficient vector and the basis vectors with
   non-negativity constraints when a new sample arrives. More importantly,
   we present sufficient convergence analyses to guarantee the performance
   of the proposed algorithm, which leads to convergence of a stable
   dictionary for characterizing the moment information of samples. We
   finally conduct a series of experiments on word-counts data and image
   data to show merits of the proposed online algorithm.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Modern advanced manufacturing technologies have made possible the
   tailored design and fabrication of complex nanoscale architectures with
   anomalous and enhanced properties, including mechanical and optical
   metamaterials; structured materials which are able to exhibit unusual
   mechanical and optical properties that are derived from their geometry
   rather than their intrinsic material properties. In this work, we
   fabricated for the first time an ultrathin 2D auxetic metamaterial with
   nanoscale geometric features specifically designed to deform in-plane by
   using focused-ion-beam milling to introduce patterned nano-slits within
   a thin membrane. The system was mechanically loaded in-situ and
   exhibited in-plane dominated deformation up to 5\% tensile strain and a
   Poisson's ratio of -0.78. Furthermore, the porosity and aperture shape
   of the metamaterial have been shown to change considerably upon the
   application of strain, with pore dimensions showing a fourfold increase
   at 5\% strain. This mechanically-controlled tuneability makes this
   metamaterial system an ideal candidate for use as a reconfigurable
   nano-filter or a nano light-modulator. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
