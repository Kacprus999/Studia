Title = {{Novel mechanical behaviors of DNA-inspired helical structures with
   chirality}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{161}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Artificially designed structures with chirality are able to possess
   novel mechanical properties, for example, chiral honeycombs with
   negative Poisson's ratio and chiral acoustic metamaterials. Inspired by
   the chiral nature of double-helical structure of DNA molecule, in this
   paper, we present a design of helical structure with chirality and study
   its mechanical behaviors through experimental characterization,
   theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. A compression-twisting
   coupling deformation mode is observed for different types of
   DNA-inspired helical structures due to the competition among
   compression, bending and twisting energy of the helical structures and
   tension energy of the interlinks. We find that interlinks between two
   intertwined helices are decisive to the compression-twisting coupling
   deformation mode and both chiral and non-chiral behaviors of the
   structures can be quantitively captured by our established theoretical
   and numerical models. The influences of various geometric parameters on
   the stiffness and deformation mode are discussed. Finally, we present
   two types of superposed structures that behave differently, showing a
   high designability of the DNA-inspired structures. This study exploits
   the chirality of bio-inspired structures and uses it in structural
   design with novel mechanical properties, which may shed light on the
   development of bio-inspired mechanical metamaterials, impact energy
   absorbers, multi-functional composite materials and among others.}},

Title = {{Texting-While-Driving Bans and Motor Vehicle Crash-Related Emergency
   Department Visits in 16 US States: 2007-2014}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To examine the impact of state texting bans on motor vehicle
   crash (MVC)-related emergency department (ED) visits.
   Methods. We used ED data from 16 US states between 2007 and 2014. We
   employed a difference-in-difference approach and conditional Poisson
   regressions to estimate changes in counts of MVC-related ED visits in
   states with and without texting bans. We also constructed age cohorts to
   explore whether texting bans have differential impacts by age group.
   Results. On average, states with a texting ban saw a 4\% reduction in
   MVC-related ED visits (incidence rate ratio = 0.96; 95\% confidence
   interval = 0.96, 0.97). This equates to an average of 1632
   traffic-related ED visits prevented per year in states with a ban. Both
   primary and secondary bans were associated with significant reductions
   in MVC-related visits to the ED regardless of whether they were on all
   drivers or young drivers only. Individuals aged 64 years and younger in
   states with a texting ban saw significantly fewer MVC-related ED visits
   following its implementation.
   Conclusions. Our findings suggest that states' efforts to curb
   distracted driving through texting bans and decrease its negative
   consequences are associated with significant decreases in the incidence
   of ED visits that follow an MVC.}},

Abstract = {{Diets low in fruits and vegetables and/or high in fast foods are
   associated with obesity and chronic diseases. Such diets may relate to
   different aspects of neighborhood food environments. We sought to
   evaluate if people's perceptions of their neighborhood food environment
   are associated with reported fruit-and-vegetable and fast-food
   consumption.
   Cross-sectional analysis of a community health survey from Philadelphia,
   PA and four surrounding suburban counties (n = 10,450 individuals). We
   used mixed-effects multi-level Poisson models, nesting individuals
   within neighborhoods-i.e. census tracts (n = 991).
   Negative perceptions of the food environment (perceived difficulty
   finding fruits and vegetables, having to travel outside of one's
   neighborhood to get to a supermarket, and perceived poor grocery
   quality) were each directly associated with fast-food consumption
   (incident rate ratios {[}IRRs] 1.31, 1.06, 1.20; p < 0.001, 0.04, <
   0.001 respectively), but not significantly associated with
   fruit-and-vegetable consumption.
   Perceived difficulty finding or accessing produce and high-quality
   groceries may support the eating of more fast food. Neighborhoods where
   food-environment perceptions are worst might benefit from interventions
   to improve availability, accessibility, and quality of healthy foods,
   towards shifting consumption away from fast foods.}},

Abstract = {{The prediction of new materials with peculiar topological properties is
   always desirable to achieve new properties and applications. In this
   work, by means of density functional theory computations, we extend the
   rule-breaking chemical bonding of planar pentacoordinate silicon (ppSi)
   into a periodic system: a C-2v Ca4Si22- molecular building block
   containing a ppSi center is identified first, followed by the
   construction of an infinite CaSi monolayer, which is essentially a
   two-dimensional (2D) network of the Ca4Si2 motif. The moderate cohesive
   energy, absence of imaginary phonon modes, and good resistance to high
   temperature indicate that the CaSi monolayer is a thermodynamically and
   kinetically stable structure. In particular, a global minimum search
   reveals that the ppSi-containing CaSi monolayer is the lowest-energy
   structure in 2D space, indicating its great promise for experimental
   realization. The CaSi monolayer is a natural semiconductor with an
   indirect band gap of 0.5 eV, and it has rather strong optical absorption
   in the visible region of the solar spectrum. More interestingly, the
   unique atomic configuration endows the CaSi monolayer with an unusually
   negative Poisson's ratio. The rule-breaking geometric structure together
   with its exceptional properties makes the CaSi monolayer quite a
   promising candidate for applications in electronics, optoelectronics,
   and mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the good balance between high efficiency and accuracy, meta-model
   based optimization algorithm is an important global optimization
   category and has been widely applied. To better solve the highly
   nonlinear and computation intensive engineering optimization problems,
   an enhanced hybrid and adaptive meta-model based global optimization
   (E-HAM) is first proposed in this work. Important region update method
   (IRU) and different sampling size strategies are proposed in the
   optimization method to enhance the performance. By applying self-moving
   and scaling strategy, the important region will be updated adaptively
   according to the search results to improve the resulting precision and
   convergence rate. Rough sampling strategy and intensive sampling
   strategy are applied at different stages of the optimization to improve
   the search efficiently and avoid results prematurely gathering in a
   small design space. The effectiveness of the new optimization algorithm
   is verified by comparing to six optimization methods with different
   variables bench mark optimization problems. The E-HAM optimization
   method is then applied to optimize the design parameters of the
   practical negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) crash box in this work. The
   results indicate that the proposed E-HAM has high accuracy and
   efficiency in optimizing the computation intensive problems and can be
   widely used in engineering industry.}},

Abstract = {{As field sampling is time consuming, it is necessary to develop
   efficient sampling techniques to obtain accurate estimates of the weed
   seedbank in soil. The relative efficiency between sampling schemes
   depends on the spatial variability in weed seed density across
   agricultural fields. Spatial variability of the weed seed density was
   characterized by theoretical correlograms. A systematic sampling (square
   grill) scheme was considered and it was found that, taking into account
   spatial variability, this sampling scheme was more efficient than simple
   random sampling. As a result, the sample size can be reduced in
   comparison with that given in previous studies, where spatial
   correlation was ignored. The reduction depends on the correlation
   structure defined as a function of the ratio, tau, between the nugget
   effect and the sill of the variogram. The maximum reduction of the
   sample size, without loss of either precision or confidence level
   corresponds to the case where there is no nugget effect, tau = 0. The
   opposite extreme case, where the reduction is nil, corresponds to the
   case of a pure nugget effect tau = 1. The abaci based on given
   expressions are provided to determine the sample size in species whose
   spatial pattern can be fitted either to a Poisson or to a negative
   binomial distribution.}},

Abstract = {{The study of soft deployable structures is an emergent field that is
   highly correlated with metamaterial design, soft robotics, medical
   devices, etc. This paper studies a novel two-dimensional (2D) soft
   deployable structure that has a fractal layout with hierarchically
   coupled thin walls, which buckles upon actuation and deforms into a
   ``peacock tail{''} pattern that is over 10 fold its original dimension.
   Large deflection theory and finite-element (FE) modeling are used to
   characterize its mechanical performance and to investigate its potential
   application in multiple fields. Further, 2D FE homogenization is
   implemented to extend the novel design into an active plane lattice
   metamaterial, on which parametric studies are carried out to explore its
   effective stiffness and large strain properties. The results show that,
   besides excellent deformability, the ``peacock tail{''} soft deployable
   structure and its lattice metamaterial derivates exhibit intriguing
   properties such as multi-stiffening, strong anisotropy, zero/negative
   Poisson's ratio, a unique post-buckling collapse mechanism, etc.
   Three-dimensional generalization of the fractal compliant system is
   modeled to elaborate on the practical use of the structures. This paper
   aims to enrich the spectrum of soft deployable structures, shedding
   light on the research of novel soft robots, hierarchical structures, and
   metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are artificial structures with unusual
   properties, such as negative Poisson ratio, bistability or tunable
   vibrational properties, that originate in the geometry of their unit
   cell(1-5). Often at the heart of such unusual behaviour is a soft mode:
   a motion that does not significantly stretch or compress the links
   between constituent elements. When activated by motors or external
   fields, soft modes become the building blocks of robots and smart
   materials. Here, we demonstrate the existence of topological soft modes
   that can be positioned at desired locations in a metamaterial while
   being robust against a wide range of structural deformations or changes
   in material parameters(6-10). These protected modes, localized at
   dislocations in deformed kagome and square lattices, are the mechanical
   analogue of topological states bound to defects in electronic
   systems(11-14). We create physical realizations of the topological modes
   in prototypes of kagome lattices built out of rigid triangular plates.
   We show mathematically that they originate from the interplay between
   two Berry phases: the Burgers vector of the dislocation and the
   topological polarization of the lattice. Our work paves the way towards
   engineering topologically protected nanomechanical structures for
   molecular robotics or information storage and read-out.}},

Abstract = {{The application of phosphorene and graphane in different photoelectric
   devices and energy reserves has attracted wide attention. Here, we
   investigated the Raman spectra, phonon dispersion and vibration modes of
   four phosphorene monolayer polymorphs and four graphane allotropes with
   the corresponding crystal structures to analyze the structure
   correlation between them. Based on the ``three identical, one
   divergent{''} pattern found in the sp(3) hybrid atomic orbitals of
   phosphorene and graphane, four new graphane conformers with different
   hydrogenation modes named gamma delta-G, alpha gamma-G, beta gamma-G and
   alpha delta-G are successfully predicted. Among these four new graphane
   conformers, beta gamma-G has the lowest binding energy, which is only
   0.02 eV per atom higher than beta-G, the most stable one among all
   graphane theoretically predicted. This means that beta gamma-G may
   co-exist with beta-G during the experimental synthesis of graphane,
   which can be distinguished from the side views with threefold structures
   for beta gamma-G and twofold structures for beta-G. All the new graphane
   conformers are direct-band-gap semiconductors with band gaps more than 3
   eV, which indicate their great potential in optoelectronic devices.
   Furthermore, three of them exhibit in-plane negative Poisson's ratios
   under tensile deformation.}},

Title = {{First-principles prediction of ferroelasticity tuned anisotropic
   auxeticity and carrier mobility in two-dimensional AgO}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{3155-3160}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) materials integrated with anisotropy and
   ferroelasticity are highly desired for controllable
   polarization-sensitive devices and ferroelastic memorizers but are
   rarely reported. Herein, using the particle swap optimization (PSO)
   method and first-principles calculations, we theoretically predicted the
   coexistence of single-direction auxeticity, anisotropic carrier
   mobility, and intrinsic ferroelasticity in 2D silver oxide (AgO). Linear
   and square-planar Ag-O ligands align vertically in 2D AgO, leading to
   remarkable in-plane anisotropy. 2D AgO exhibits a large out-of-plane
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of -0.47 which can only be triggered by
   the uniaxial strain along the y-direction. The electrons/holes favor the
   transport along the x-direction with mobilities of up to similar to
   6000/4000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), which is around 10/17 times higher than that
   along the y-direction. Moreover, a strain-driven 90 degrees lattice
   rotation is found in 2D AgO with a record high reversal strain of
   107.6\%. Such integration allows us to tune the direction of the
   anisotropic properties, and at the same time enables the efficient
   identification of the bi-stable states during the ferroelastic
   transition, thus promising the versatile applications of 2D AgO in
   controllable mechanic/electronic devices and non-volatile information
   storage.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association between negative self-rated health
   and indicators of health, wellbeing and sociodemographic variables in
   older adults.
   METHODS: Cross-sectional study that used data from a population-based
   health survey with a probability cluster sample that was carried out in
   Campinas, SP, Southeastern Brazil,, in 2008 and 2009. The participants
   were older adults (>= 60 years) and the dependent variable was
   self-rated health, categorized as: excellent, very good, good, bad and
   very bad. The adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated by means of
   Poisson multiple regression.
   RESULTS: The highest prevalences of bad/very bad self-rated health were
   observed in the individuals who never attended school, in those with
   lower level of schooling, with monthly per capita family income lower
   than one minimum salary. Individuals who scored five or more in the
   physical health indicator also had bad self-rated health, as well as
   those who scored five or more in the Self-Reporting Questionnaire 20 and
   those who did not refer feeling happiness all the time.
   CONCLUSIONS: The independent effects of material life conditions,
   physical and mental health and subjective wellbeing, observed in
   self-rated health, suggest that older adults can benefit by health
   policies supported by a global and integrative view of old age.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) may impact the choice
   of parenthood. Objective: To investigate the number of live births,
   abortions and ectopic pregnancies among persons with MS. Methods: From
   the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry, we extracted data from all
   persons diagnosed with MS from 1960 to 1996 and matched each MS person
   with four reference persons. We used a negative binomial regression
   model for the live births and Poisson regression model for abortions and
   ectopic pregnancies. The total fertility rate (TFR) during 1960-2016 and
   the annual number of live births in the MS population were analysed.
   Results: Persons with MS had fewer children than reference persons.
   Fewer women with MS had elective abortions after diagnosis (incidence
   rate ratio (IRR) = 0.88; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.78-1.00) than
   reference persons. There was no difference regarding the number of
   elective abortions, spontaneous abortions or ectopic pregnancies after
   onset. The TFR was lower for women with MS than for reference persons,
   and the number of annual live births by MS persons increased during
   1960-2016. Conclusion: MS seems to considerably impact reproductive
   choices, especially after clinical diagnosis, resulting in the MS
   population having fewer children than the general population.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic constants c(11), c(12) and c(44) of U, Np, Pu, and Am
   telluride single crystals have been obtained by Brillouin scattering
   from the measured sound velocities in prominent crystallographic
   directions. In case of the U chalcogenides also by ultrasound
   techniques. The Cauchy pressure, the Poisson ratio, the anisotropy
   ratio, the bulk modulus and the Debye temperature have been derived from
   these data. U and Pu telluride have a negative c(12), implying
   intermediate valence. AmTe has a very low bulk modulus, but a positive
   c(12). It is extremely soft, with a very low sound velocity. For AmTe
   also the LO and TO phonon frequencies could be determined. The elastic
   data point to a divalent Am state. The optical reflectivity of the light
   actinide tellurides land sometimes of all chalcogenides) has been
   measured between UV and infrared wavelengths, in the case of AmTe down
   to the far infrared. The plasma edge of the free carriers has been
   determined, which yields the ratio of n/m{*}. Together with the gamma
   value of the specific heat and magnetic data a consistent proposal for
   the electronic structure of the light actinide chalcogenides can be
   given. Thus, the Pu chalcogenides are intermediate valent and represent
   the high-pressure phase of the corresponding Sm chalcogenides. AmTe, as

Title = {{A study of mortality among 14730 male workers in 12 Norwegian ferroalloy

Abstract = {{Objectives - Concern about the health hazards of exposure to workers in
   the ferroalloy industry has initiated this historical cohort study. The
   aim was to examine the mortality pattern among male employees in 12
   Norwegian ferroalloy plants.
   Methods - All men employed for at least six months who started their
   first employment during 1933-91 were eligible for the cohort. Deaths
   observed during 1962-90 were compared with expected figures calculated
   from national mortalities. Internal comparisons of rates were performed
   by Poisson regression analysis. The final cohort comprised 14 730 male
   employees who were observed for 288 886 person-years.
   Results - Mortality from all causes of death was slightly increased
   (3390 deaths, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 1.08, 95\% confidence
   interval (95\% CI) 1.04-1.11). Regression analysis of total mortality
   showed a significant negative trend for the rate ratios with increasing
   duration of employment. An increased mortality was found among employees
   in urban plants compared with employees in rural plants (rate ratio (RR)
   1.21, 95\% CI 1.13-1.29). Excess deaths from cancer (SMR 1.11) and
   sudden death (SMR 1.47) were found among employees with at least three
   years of employment. Mortality from accidents, poisonings, and violence
   was increased among all employees (SMR 1.28). Excess deaths from this
   cause were however only found for the time after the end of employment
   in this industry and not during employment (SMR 0.90).
   Conclusions - The increased mortality from cancer and sudden death could
   be related to work exposures, at least in sub-groups, and these results
   warrant further studies. The excess deaths from accidents, poisonings,
   and violence were probably not related to work exposures. The mortality
   results for short term workers and other information indicate that
   systematic errors contribute to the increased overall mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Topology optimization is a methodology for assigning material or void to
   each point in a design domain in a way that extremizes some objective
   function, such as the compliance of a structure under given loads,
   subject to various imposed constraints, such as an upper bound on the
   mass of the structure. Geometry projection is a means to parameterize
   the topology optimization problem, by describing the design in a way
   that is independent of the mesh used for analysis of the design's
   performance; it results in many fewer design parameters, necessarily
   resolves the ill-posed nature of the topology optimization problem, and
   provides sharp descriptions of the material interfaces. We extend
   previous geometric projection work to 3 dimensions and design unit cells
   for lattice materials using inverse homogenization. We perform a
   sensitivity analysis of the geometric projection and show it has smooth
   derivatives, making it suitable for use with gradient-based optimization
   algorithms. The technique is demonstrated by designing unit cells
   comprised of a single constituent material plus void space to obtain
   light, stiff materials with cubic and isotropic material symmetry. We
   also design a single-constituent isotropic material with negative
   Poisson's ratio and a light, stiff material comprised of 2 constituent
   solids plus void space.}},

Abstract = {{A precipitator section is modeled numerically in 3D to determine the
   collection efficiency for conductive diesel exhaust particulates. It
   consists of a circular tube and a wire electrode mounted at the center
   of the tube, supplied with a negative high dc voltage, while the tube is
   electrically grounded. The analytical solutions of Poisson and current
   continuity equations are implemented to obtain the ionic space charge
   density and electric potential distributions in the channel. Commercial
   CFD FLUENT software is used to solve the k-epsilon turbulent flow model,
   while also considering the electrical body forces. Particle charging and
   motion equations are solved using Discrete Phase Model (DPM) feature of
   the FLUENT and programming User Defined Functions (UDFs). Particles are
   assumed to be charged by combined field and diffusion charging
   mechanisms. Effects of some electrical characteristics of diesel exhaust
   particulates, such as charge-to-mass ratio and particle migration
   velocity, on collection efficiency are assessed. Patterns of particle
   deposition along the channel are evaluated and compared for different
   particle sizes. Numerical modeling of the 3D EHD flow pattern induced by
   corona discharge is demonstrated in the cross section of the tube when
   the corona wire is slightly off-center (eccentric) in an arbitrary
   direction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper models a multibody collision in the impulse space as a state
   transition diagram, where each state represents a phase during which
   impacts are ``active{''} at only a subset of the contact points. A state
   transition happens whenever an active impact finishes restitution, or an
   inactive impact gets reactivated, depending on whether the two involved
   bodies are instantaneously penetrating into each other or not. The
   elastic energy due to an impact is not only affected by the impulse at
   the corresponding contact point, but also by other impulses exerted on
   the two involved bodies during the impact. Consequently, Poisson's
   impulse-based law of restitution could result in negative energy. A new
   law governing the loss of elastic energy during restitution is
   introduced. Convergence of the impulse sequence generated by the state
   transition diagram is established. The collision outcome depends on the
   ratios of the contact stiffnesses rather than on their individual
   values. The collision model is then applied in an analysis of billiard
   shooting in which the cue stick impacts the cue ball, which in turn
   impacts the pool table. The system is driven by the normal impulses at
   the two contacts with the tangential impulses determined via a contact
   mode analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Negative health outcome and its relationship with length and severity of
   Childhood Sexual Abuse is well established in the literature.Until
   recently, this literature consisted disproportionately of studies of
   adults recalling past events. For guidelines for the treatment of
   childhood survivors, research focused on child victims may be more
   relevant. We aim to characterize factors related to long-term and severe
   sexual abuse among children in SAo Paulo, Brazil.We conducted a
   cross-sectional study of children up to the age of ten, referred to a
   specialty program on sexual abuse between 2004 and 2013. Length and
   severity of the abuse were tested for associations with variables
   related to the abuse using a Chi-square test, followed by the Poisson
   regression with robust variance for prevalence ratio. Most children
   experienced abuse were reliant on relatives or friends for housing
   (45\%). The time between abuse and reporting was longer when the
   perpetrator lived in the same household as the child and when abuse was
   reported by a relative or friend. Abuse was more frequent among female
   children, but longer and more severe in males. A lack of independent
   housing, parents' education and social stigma facilitated childhood
   sexual abuse by delaying reporting among our sample.}},

Abstract = {{Polyion complex (PIC) hydrogels have been proposed as promising
   engineered soft materials due to their high toughness and good
   processability. In this work, we reported manufacturing of complex
   structures with tough PIC hydrogels based on three-dimensional (3D)
   printing technology. The strategy relies on the distinct strength of
   ionic bonding in PIC hydrogels at different stages of printing. In
   concentrated saline solution, PIC forms viscous solution, which can be
   directly extruded out of a nozzle into water, where dialyzing out of
   salt and counterions results in sol gel transition to form tough
   physical PIC gel with intricate structures. The printability of PIC
   solutions was systematically investigated by adjusting the PIC material
   formula and printing parameters in which proper viscosity and gelation
   rate were found to be key factors for successful 3D printing. Uniaxial
   tensile tests were performed to printed single fibers and multilayer
   grids, both exhibiting distinct yet controllable strength and toughness.
   More complex 3D structures with negative Poisson's ratio, gradient grid,
   and material anisotropy were constructed as well, demonstrating the
   flexible printability of PIC hydrogels. The methodology and capability
   here provide a versatile platform to fabricate complex structures with
   tough PIC hydrogels, which should broaden the use of such materials in
   applications such as biomedical devices and artificial tissues.}},

Abstract = {{The design and development of a novel six-axis micropositioning stage
   are presented in this study. Based on Stewart's theory, negative
   Poisson's ratio is adopted for the design of flexure hinges for this
   stage. The stage consists of a top hexagonal plate, a bottom hexagonal
   plate and six trapezoidal amplifiers. The flexure hinge in the inner
   part of the amplifier has a symmetrical double layer, and that in the
   outer part of the amplifier has an unsymmetrical single layer. The
   deformation and amplification are calculated in a numerical simulation
   with the finite element method. An experiment for measuring the
   displacement of the stage is carried out. In the experiments, each
   amplifier is driven by a piezoelectric transducer, and the displacements
   are measured with a laser displacement sensor then recorded for
   comparison of the single-axis amplifier with the six-axis stage. The
   results show that the amplification of the displacement of a single-axis
   amplifier is about 15. Also, the simulation and experimental results for
   the six-axis stage show all errors of motion to be <3\%. It is obvious
   that the novel six-axis stage possesses the characteristics of high
   amplification and minimisation, as well as being low cost.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the use
   of crack and other illicit drugson oral health-related quality of life
   (OHRQoL) in young adults.
   MethodsThis cross-sectional study evaluated 106 crack users at a public
   treatment center for drug addiction and 106 controls matched for gender,
   age, and use of tobacco. Clinical examinations were performed for dental
   caries and periodontal disease. The outcome was OHRQoL, which was
   determined using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). The
   association between OHRQoL and illicit drugswas modeled using
   conditional Poisson regression.
   ResultsUsers of crack and other illicit drugshad a poorer OHRQoL than
   the controls (p<.001). Among the crack users, the odds ratio to yield
   high OHIP-14 was 3.40 (95\% confidence interval, 1.91-6.08). Adjustment
   for sex, age, schooling, income, smoking, dental caries, and periodontal
   disease did not change such an estimate considerably. The functional
   limitation and psychological discomfort domains were associated with the
   use of illicit drugs.
   ConclusionUsers of crack and other illicit drugs exerted a negative
   impact on OHRQoL independently of socio-demographic characteristics and
   tobacco use, suggesting the need for special attention regarding the
   specific oral health needs of this population as well as drug prevention
   and treatment strategies.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundPeople residing outside the capital cities have poorer oral
   health than their city counterparts. Health workforce shortages and
   stability issues can have negative health effects on rural populations.
   There has been an increasing proportion of women entering the dental
   practitioner workforce in Australia. This study investigated whether
   dental practitioners who have a rural background are more likely to work
   in a rural area than those who do not have a rural background; and
   whether the gender of dental practitioners plays a role.
   MethodsA self-administered questionnaire was sent to a sample of dental
   practitioners via their professional dental associations. Practice
   location was assigned as either urban' or rural' using the Australian
   Standard Geographical Classification - Remoteness Area categories and
   measured with demographic characteristics of the respondents. Prevalence
   ratios (PR) were estimated using Poisson regression with robust standard
   errors.
   ResultsParticipants with a rural background were more than twice as
   likely (male PR = 2.23, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.79-6.26;
   female PR = 2.82, 95\% CI = 1.35-5.87) to practise in a rural area than

Volume = {{2019}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{Muzhailing Highway Extra-long Tunnel in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China,
   belongs to the soft rock tunnel in the extremely high geostress area.
   During the construction process, large deformation of the soft rock
   occurred frequently. Taking the no. 2 inclined shaft of Muzhailing
   tunnel as the research object, an NPR (negative Poisson's ratio)
   constant resistance and large deformation anchor cable support system
   based on high prestress force, constant resistance, and releasing
   surrounding rock pressure was proposed. The characteristics of the
   surrounding rock under the steel arch support and NPR anchor cable
   support were compared and analyzed by using 3DEC software. A series of
   field tests were conducted in the no. 2 inclined shaft, and the rock
   strength, displacement of the surrounding rock, deep displacement of the
   surrounding rock, internal force of steel arch, and axial force of
   anchor cable were measured to study the application effect of the NPR
   anchor cable support system in tunnel engineering. Moreover, the 3DEC
   numerical simulation results were compared with the field test results.
   The research results show that the application of NPR constant
   resistance and large deformation anchor cable support system in tunnel
   engineering has achieved good results, and it plays a significant role
   in controlling the large deformation of the tunnel surrounding rock.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Postcoital genital washing by uncircumcised men may affect
   the risk of male HIV acquisition.
   Method: We assessed the association between self-reported washing after
   sex in 2976 initially HIV-negative, uncircumcised men enrolled in a
   prospective cohort study in Rakai, Uganda.
   Results: Data from the 2976 participants who reported sexual intercourse
   in the past 12 months contributed 4290 visits, with 7316.6 person-years
   of observation during the 2-year follow-up. The overall HIV-incidence
   was 1.28/100 person-years 95\%CI (1.04-1.57). About 91.0\% of men
   reported washing their penis after sex, and their HIV incidence was
   1.34/100 person-years (95\%CI 1.08-1.66), compared with an incidence of
   0.62/100 person-years (95\%CI 0.17-1.60) in men who did not wash their
   penis after intercourse. Using Poisson multivariable regression, the
   adjusted incidence rate ratio of HIV acquisition associated with
   postcoital washing was 1.94 (95\%CI 0.71-5.29).
   Conclusion: Postcoital penile washing, as practiced in this rural
   African population does not afford protection from HIV acquisition among
   uncircumcised men, and may increase risk. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters

Abstract = {{A strain-consistent elastic plate model is formulated in which both
   initial surface tension and the induced residual stress are treated as
   finite values, and the exactly same strain expressions are consistently
   employed for both the surface and the bulk plate. Different than most of
   previous related models which follow the original Gurtin-Murdoch model
   and include some non-strain displacement gradient terms (which cannot be
   expressed in terms of the surface infinitesimal strains or the von
   Karman-type strains) in the surface stress-strain relations, the present
   model does not include any non-strain displacement gradient terms in the
   surface stress-strain relations. For a free elastic plate with in-plane
   movable edges, the present model predicts that initial surface tension
   exactly cancels out the induced residual compressive stress. On the
   other hand, if all edges are in-plane immovable, residual stress cannot
   develop in the plate and the initial surface tension causes a tensile
   net membrane force. In addition, the present model predicts that initial
   surface tension reduces the effective bending rigidity of the plate,
   while this reduction does not depend on Poisson ratio. In particular,
   self-buckling of a free elastic plate under tensile surface tension
   cannot occur unless the effective bending rigidity of plate vanishes or
   becomes negative.}},

   two-dimensional solids with circular inclusions}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Elastic materials with holes and inclusions are important in a large
   variety of contexts ranging from construction material to biological
   membranes. More recently, they have also been exploited inmechanical
   metamaterials, where the geometry of highly deformable structures is
   responsible for their unusual properties, such as negative Poisson's
   ratio, mechanical cloaking, and tunable phononic band gaps.
   Understanding how such structures deform in response to applied external
   loads is thus crucial for designing novel mechanical metamaterials. Here
   we present a method for predicting the linear response of infinite 2D
   solid structures with circular holes and inclusions by employing
   analogies with electrostatics. Just like an external electric field
   induces polarization (dipoles, quadrupoles, and other multipoles) of
   conductive and dielectric objects, external stress induces elastic
   multipoles inside holes and inclusions. Stresses generated by these
   induced elastic multipoles then lead to interactions between holes and
   inclusions, which induce additional polarization and thus additional
   deformation of holes and inclusions. We present a method that expands
   the induced polarization in a series of elastic multipoles, which
   systematically takes into account the interactions of inclusions and
   holes with the external stress field and also between them. The results
   of our method show good agreement with both linear finite element
   simulations and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This study uses density functional theory to investigate the structural,
   mechanical, electronic, optical, and thermodynamic properties of
   tetragonal LaRhGe3, LaIrGe3, and LaPdGe3 compounds. The investigated
   lattice parameter showed similar results to the experimental data,
   justifying the accuracy of our calculations. The negative values of
   formation enthalpy confirmed the thermodynamic stability of LaTGe3 (T =
   Rh, Ir, or Pd). The mechanical stability of these compounds was also
   verified by their single independent elastic constants. Poisson's and
   Pugh's ratios revealed that all the compounds have a ductile nature. The
   metallic nature of these phases was found from their band structure
   calculations. The study of Mulliken bond populations and charge density
   maps ensured the existence of a mixed character of ionic, covalent, and
   metallic nature in LaRhGe3, LaIrGe3, and LaPdGe3 compounds. Detailed
   investigation was also performed on optical properties, and the
   dielectric function, absorption, and conductivity again ensured the
   metallic feature of all these phases. The calculated optical functions
   suggested their potential application in quantum-dot light emitting
   diodes, organic light emitting diodes, solar cells, waveguides, and
   solar heating reduction. Moreover, the very low values of minimum
   thermal conductivity and the Debye temperature are indicative of their
   suitability for thermal barrier coating materials.}},

Abstract = {{The 3D printing of nasopharyngeal swabs during the COVID-19 pandemic
   presents a central case of how to efficiently address a break in the
   global supply chain of medical equipment. Herein a comprehensive study
   of swab design considerations for mass production by stereolithography
   is presented. The retention and comfort performance of a range of novel
   designs of 3D-printed swabs are compared with the standard flocked-head
   swab used in clinical environments. Sample retention of the 3D swab is
   governed by the volume, porosity density, and void fraction of the head
   as well as by the pore geometry. 3D-printed swabs outperform
   conventional flock-head swabs in terms of sample retention. It is argued
   that mechanically functional designs of the swab head, such as
   corkscrew-shaped heads and negative Poisson ratio heads, maximize sample
   retention and improve patient comfort. In addition, available designs of
   swab shafts for an optimized sample collection procedure are
   characterized. The study is conducted in vitro, using artificial mucus,
   covering the full range of human mucus viscosities in a 3D-printed model
   of a nasal cavity. The work sets the path for the resilient supply of
   widespread sterile testing equipment as a rapid response to the current
   and future pandemics.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid HIV tests are used in maternity hospitals to prevent

   associated with submission to the rapid HIV test (outcome). This is a
   cross-sectional study conducted in 2009 in 15 hospitals from the Rio de
   Janeiro's Unified Health System (SUS) by interviewing a representative
   sample of 835 pregnant women hospitalized for birth and by verifying
   medical records. Adjusted prevalence ratios were obtained by Poisson
   regression according to a hierarchical model, and variables associated
   with the outcome (p <= 0.05) remained in the final model. According to
   medical records (MR), 79.6\% of mothers were submitted to rapid HIV test
   and, according to interviews (INT), 55.7\%. At the distal level, the
   lack of a partner (MR), having >= 6 residents at home (MR) and non-white
   skin color (INT) were associated with a higher prevalence of the
   outcome. At the intermediate level, not having a negative HIV serology
   from prenatal care (MR and INT) was associated with a higher prevalence
   of the outcome, as well as PHC prenatal care (MR) and lack of prenatal
   care (INT). At the proximal level, delivery in a hospital not certified

Title = {{Slope Sliding Force Prediction via Belief Rule-Based Inferential
   Methodology}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{965-977}},
Abstract = {{Slope sliding force can be measured by an anchor cable sensor with the
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) property. It is capable of reflecting the
   stability of the slope intuitively. Thus, predicting the variation trend
   of the sliding force is able to achieve early warning for landslide
   disaster, thereby avoiding losses to the lives and property of the
   people. In this paper, due to the uncertain variation of the sliding
   force, a belief rule-based (BRB) sliding force prediction model is
   established to describe the nonlinear and uncertain relationship between
   the history/current sliding force and the future sliding force. In this
   model, the activated belief rules are fused by adopting the evidence
   reasoning (ER) algorithm. And based on the fused results, the sliding
   force at a future time can be predicted accurately. Moreover,
   considering the variation of the sliding force on different slopes or
   different monitoring points in the same slope, a parameter transfer
   strategy of BRB model together with a corresponding online update method
   are proposed to achieve the adaptive design of the BRB prediction model.
   Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed sliding force prediction
   methods has been verified by experiments on the sub-section of the China
   West-East Gas Pipeline Project. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{The use of antiretroviral drugs has increased the survival of HIV
   patients, but may have side effects, such as lipodystrophic syndrome.
   This article aims to identify the frequency of the lipodystrophic
   syndrome and its associated factors in patients with HIV using
   antiretroviral therapy. It involved a cross-sectional study with HIV
   patients, monitored on an outpatient basis. The syndrome was evaluated
   by the association of two parameters: peripheral weight loss through the
   lipodystrophy severity scale and central fat accumulation, measured by
   the hip waist ratio. Poisson regression analysis was performed to
   identify the associated variables. Of the 104 patients evaluated, 27.9\%
   presented the syndrome. After adjustment, the female sex (PRadjusted =
   2.16 CI95\% 1.43-3.39), being overweight (PRadjusted = 2.23 CI95\%
   1.35-2.65) and a longer period of use of antiretrovirals (PRadjusted =
   1.64 CI95\% 1.16-2.78), us remained positively associated with the
   syndrome. On the other hand, a negative association with CD4 count 
   pound 350 (PRadjusted = 0.39 CI95\% 0.10-0.97) was observed The high
   prevalence of the syndrome and its association with specific groups
   reinforce the need for adequate follow-up and early identification to
   intervene in modifiable factors.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to childhood religious affiliations where the majority of

   for Black men who have sex with men. This study tested the hypothesis
   that exposures to these environments during childhood were associated
   with adulthood human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted
   infection (STI) behavioral risk and HIV infection, because these
   exposures influenced HIV/STI risk by undermining race/sexual identity
   congruence and increasing internalized homophobia and interpersonal
   anxiety. Structural equation modeling as well as logistic and Poisson
   regressions were performed using baseline data from HIV Prevention
   Trials Network 061 (N = 1,553). Childhood religion affiliations that
   were more discouraging of homosexuality were associated with increased
   likelihood of HIV infection; however, the association was no longer
   significant after adjusting for age, income, and education. Having a
   childhood religion affiliation with high prevalence of beliefs
   discouraging homosexuality was associated with increased numbers of
   sexual partners (adjusted odds ratio = 4.31; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}3.76, 4.94], p <.01). The hypothesized path model was largely
   supported and accounted for 37\% of the variance in HIV infection;
   however, interpersonal anxiety was not associated with HIV/STI risk
   behaviors. Structural interventions are needed that focus on developing
   affirming theologies in religious institutions with Black men who have

Abstract = {{This study investigated whether alcohol use influences periodontal

   those participants who took part in both the Health 2000 Survey and the
   Follow-up Study on Finnish Adults' Oral Health. The participants at
   baseline were aged >= 30 yr, periodontally healthy, and did not have
   diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. The development of periodontal pockets
   at follow-up was measured as the number of teeth with periodontal
   pockets and the presence of periodontal pockets. Alcohol use at baseline
   was measured as g/wk, frequency, and use over the risk limit. Incidence
   rate ratios with 95\% CI were estimated using negative binomial
   regression models and Poisson regression models with a robust variance
   estimator. No consistent association was found between any of the
   alcohol variables and periodontal pocket development in the total
   population or among non-smokers. Among smokers, a positive association
   was found with the frequency of alcohol use. In general, risk estimates
   were slightly higher for women than for men. In summary,
   light-to-moderate alcohol use appears not to be consistently associated
   with the development of periodontal pockets. The adverse effects on the
   periodontium seem, to some extent, to be dependent on gender and

Abstract = {{Data suggest that pregnant women in some settings have high prevalence
   of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). We examined
   changes in sexual risk behaviors and intravaginal practices during
   pregnancy that may contribute to HIV and STI incidence using data from
   the Methods for Improved Reproductive Health in Africa study conducted
   in South Africa and Zimbabwe 2003-2006. We used a crossover design and
   modified Poisson regression to compare behaviors among HIV negative
   women 18-45 years during pregnant and non-pregnant periods. Among the
   4802 women <45 years at enrollment, 483 (10.1 \%) had a pregnancy and
   were included in the analysis. Compared to non-pregnant periods,
   pregnancy was associated with fewer than 3 sex acts per week (adjusted
   risk ratio {[}ARR] 0.89; 95 \% CI 0.79-0.99) but more sex acts without
   condoms (ARR 1.32; 95 \% CI 1.15-1.51). Pregnancy was also associated
   with decreased reporting of other sexual risk behaviors including any
   anal sex, multiple sexual partners, and/or sex in exchange for drugs or
   money. Women also reported less intravaginal wiping during pregnancy
   (ARR 0.84; 95 \% CI 0.76-0.93). We found pregnancy decreased sexual
   activity and some high-risk sexual behaviors but increased the risk of
   sex without a condom.}},

Abstract = {{Natural fibre composites e.g. wood can display enormous ductility. This
   ductility is achieved through judicious placement of fibril orientations
   in the cell walls of plants and also through combination with other
   polymers (other than cellulose). The primary cell wall of plants is
   typically a random fibrous network. This talk will discuss the
   interesting enhanced ductility effects that can be obtained from random
   nanofibrous networks. It will be shown that it might be possible to
   obtain double curvature using auxetic effects. In addition to this some
   recent work on nucleating crazing in amorphous polymers using cellulose
   nanofibers will be reviewed. The crazing effect is shown to enormously
   enhance ductility leading to pronounced air scattering and stress
   whitening of the polymer.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify psychosocial characteristics associated with
   dental anxiety in children aged 7-13 years in the dental setting.
   Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with
   children aged 7-13 years attended at the Dentistry School of Pelotas,
   Brazil. Data collection was based on a questionnaire administered to
   mothers and children, and the behavior of children during dental
   treatment was evaluated using the Frankl' Scale. Data were analyzed
   using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests in order to analyze the
   association between independent variables and dental anxiety. The effect
   of variables on the outcome was assessed by the Poisson regression model
   with robust variance (Prevalence Ratio; 95\% Confidence interval).
   Results: A total of 187 children were included. Dental anxiety
   prevalence was 40.11\%. After adjustments, younger children (p=0.046),
   only child (p=0.019), and children with negative previous dental
   experience (p=0.046) showed higher dental anxiety prevalence. Children
   with uncooperative behavior in previous (p=0.033) and current (p=0.001)
   dental appointments showed higher dental anxiety prevalence. Conclusion:
   In this sample of children treated at a dentistry school, a report of
   dental anxiety was associated with age, birth order, previous dental
   experience and behavior in dental settings.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the stability criteria of Fisher and Ruelle {[}J. Math. Phys.
   7, 260 (1966)] which can be used to establish if a given pair potential
   satisfies the requirements for thermodynamic stability. The mechanical
   and thermodynamic stability are considered for systems composed of
   particles interacting with a bounded potential, which could be used to
   model a mesostructured material at a coarse-grained level. The elastic
   moduli of fee and bee solids at zero temperature are calculated as a
   function of density for an assembly of particles interacting via the
   following (at r = 0) bounded potentials: (a) a Gaussian Core Model, GCM,
   potential, phi(r) = exp (-r(2)), and (b) the separation-shifted
   Lennard-Jones, SSLJ, bounded potential, phi(r)=4{[}1(alpha(2)+r(2))(6) -
   1/(alpha(2) + r(2))3], with alpha > 0, where in both cases the
   characteristic energy and lengthscale are set to unity, and r is the
   separation between the particles. For both potential forms, at low
   densities, the static fee structure is the thermodynamically stable
   structural form but from above a certain density the bee lattice becomes
   the stable structure. It is shown that for the SSLJ potential this
   transition density varies roughly as similar to alpha(-3). In the T -> 0
   limit, auxetic behaviour is demonstrated to occur for both fee and bee
   structures, but at high pressure and for the bee structural form its
   response to external strain can be entirely nonauxetic. A significant
   role of the attractive part of the interparticle interaction in
   enhancing auxetic behaviour is observed. The ranges of the mechanical
   stability are determined for both systems. At zero temperature, the
   lattice becomes mechanically unstable for alpha > alpha(c), which
   appears to coincide with the value alpha(c) = (7/32)(1/6) = 0.7762
   proved previously to lead to thermodynamically unstable fluid states for
   this potential. (C) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

   socio-demographic information, the Brazilian version of the Early
   Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale, their child's general/oral health
   and the Brazilian version of the Dental Discomfort Questionnaire. The
   children underwent an oral examination. Descriptive statistics,

   Poisson regression were used to determine associations between the
   variables (prevalence ratio {[}PR], alpha = 5\%). Results The prevalence
   of dental caries and dental pain was 43.1\% and 40.2\%, respectively.
   Dental pain (PR: 1.96, 95\% CI 1.52-2.54; p < 0.001), monthly household

Abstract = {{A novel type of tubular structure has been proposed in this paper, which
   is the first tubular structure with auxeticity in the wall thickness as
   well as in the radial direction. This tubular structure exhibits good
   stability under axial compression. The most innovative feature is that
   its inner diameter and outer diameter have opposite deformation
   directions. When axially compressed (stretched), its outer diameter will
   become smaller (larger) while its inner diameter will become larger
   (smaller). Besides, its closed surfaces of tube wall can broaden its
   applications in the fields of civil engineering and mechanical
   engineering. The accuracy of the finite element model was verified by
   comparison between experiments and numerical analysis. Deformation
   characteristics of tubular models generated by offset method and
   rotation method were studied. The influence of cell layers, PSF (Pattern
   Scale Factor) value and t/R (the ratio of wall thickness t to diameter
   R) value was also studied by parametric analysis.}},

   factors was of 34.3\% and the common Brazilian pattern was the one that
   most contributed to proportional variance. We highlight the
   dairy/porridge pattern, in which breast milk had negative factorial
   loading, suggesting its substitution by cow and modified milk. The data
   reveal that the characterization of children's eating patterns diverges
   according to maternal characteristics, such as age, educational level
   and number of children. Three of the four patterns we found are
   represented by foods rich in starch, saturated fat and simple sugar and
   poor in vitamins, minerals and fibers. Multiparity, lower educational
   levels and maternal age under 20 years were associated with a lower
   consumption of foods considered to be healthy and important in child
   development.}},

Abstract = {{A cylindrically curved panel in a state of generalized plane strain
   subject to a radial temperature gradient is discussed by analytical
   means. The ends of this thick-walled shell are presupposed to be guided
   in such a way that a displacement in circumferential direction may occur
   and that the radius of the middle surface remains unchanged. Then,
   couples act on those ends, giving rise to pure bending condition. The
   material is power-law functionally graded, and - based on the rule of
   mixtures - a coherent dependence of all the material properties (except
   for Poisson's ratio) on the radial coordinate is taken into account. The
   stresses occurring for both a positive and a negative temperature
   gradient are analyzed, and one finds that, depending on the grading
   exponent, the yield limit according to von Mises may be reached either
   at the inner surface, the outer surface or at both surfaces
   simultaneously. Numerical results are provided for a steel/aluminum FGM,
   and it is shown that by appropriate grading not only a reduction of the
   couples acting at the supports but in some cases also a considerable
   reduction of the weight of the panel may be achieved. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{There are few studies that compare opportunistic infection (OI) rates
   for U.S.-born, Mexican-born, and Central American-born Latinos in the
   pre- or post-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. Data on
   803 Latino persons in treatment for HIV infection in Los Angeles,
   California, were examined to evaluate differences in risk for specific
   and total OIs by country of origin. In a Cox proportional hazards
   regression analysis that controlled for HAART use, CD4 counts, and age,
   U.S.-born Latino women were more likely than Central American-born
   Latino women to develop an OI from 1996 to 2000 (hazard ratio {[}HR] =
   2.9, 95\% confidence intervals {[}CIs]: 1.3, 6.5). In a Poisson
   regression analysis, U.S.-born Latino men and women combined were at
   greater risk for HIV encephalopathy (RR = 3.4, 95\% CIs: 1.2, 10.0) and
   Kaposi's sarcoma (RR = 2.9, 95\% CIs: 1.1, 7.6). In addition to
   underreporting that may result from the use of English-based criteria
   for diagnosing HIV encephalopathy among Spanish-speaking patients, these
   HAART era data suggest that variation in OI risk among Latinos may also
   be explained by acculturation factors, such as loss of social support
   systems and negative lifestyle changes.}},

Title = {{Early adolescent pregnancy increases risk of incident HIV infection in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{MAR 19}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Adolescents having unprotected heterosexual intercourse
   are at risk of HIV infection and unwanted pregnancy. However, there is
   little evidence to indicate whether pregnancy in early adolescence
   increases the risk of subsequent HIV infection. In this paper, we tested
   the hypothesis that adolescent pregnancy (aged 15 or younger) increases
   the risk of incident HIV infection in young South African women.
   Methods: We assessed 1099 HIV-negative women, aged 15-26 years, who were
   volunteer participants in a cluster-randomized, controlled HIV
   prevention trial in the predominantly rural Eastern Cape province of
   South Africa. All of these young women had at least one additional HIV
   test over two years of follow-up. Outcomes were HIV incidence rates per
   100 person years and HIV incidence rate ratios (IRRs) estimated by
   Poisson multivariate models. Three pregnancy categories were created for
   the Poisson model: early adolescent pregnancy (a first pregnancy at age
   15 years or younger); later adolescent pregnancy (a first pregnancy at
   age 16 to 19 years); and women who did not report an adolescent
   pregnancy. Models were adjusted for study design, age, education, time
   since first sexual experience, socio-economic status, childhood trauma
   and herpes simplex virus type 2 infection.
   Results: HIV incidence rates were 6.0 per 100 person years over two
   years of follow-up. The adjusted IRR was 3.02 (95\% CI 1.50-6.09) for a
   pregnancy occurring at age 15 or younger. Women with pregnancies
   occurring between 16 and 19 years of age did not have a higher incidence
   of HIV (IRR 1.08; 95\% CI 0.64 1.84). Early adolescent pregnancies were
   associated with higher partner numbers and a greater age difference with
   partners.
   Conclusions: Early adolescent pregnancies increase the incidence of HIV
   among South African women. The higher risk is associated with sexual
   risk behaviours such as higher partner numbers and a greater age
   difference with partners rather than a biological explanation of
   hormonal changes during pregnancy.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and trap densities of organic
   bistable devices (OBDs) fabricated utilizing SnO2 nanoparticles embedded
   in a polymer layer in the framework of the space-charge limited current
   (SCLC) model were calculated in order to investigate the transition
   mechanisms of the states and to compare the values with the experimental
   I-V curves of the fabricated OBDs. The effect of the trap density and
   depth on the current bistability in OBDs with a single layer was
   simulated using the Poisson equation, the drift equation, and the
   single-level trap model. The slope of the current variation for OBDs in
   the low conductivity (OFF) state was between 2 and 3, and that for the
   devices in the high conductivity (ON) state was 2, indicative of the
   appearance of a SCLC. The ON/OFF conductivity ratio of the OBDs was
   approximately 10(2). Because the electron occupation probability
   increased with increasing trap depth, the number of electrons trapped in
   the organic layer increased, resulting in an increase in the ON/OFF
   ratio of the current bistability. The experimental I-V curves for OBDs
   were in reasonable agreement with the theoretical I-V curves obtained by
   using a simulation method. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{When using a supporting laser patterning method, it is possible to
   adaptively tailor the strength variations and formability of a
   pre-fabricated single panel. This paper focuses on the effect of line
   and geometrical laser patterning on the strength enhancement and
   material behaviour of steel sheets. To validate the performance of the
   laser patterning specimens, a tensile test for evaluating the in-plane
   deformation behaviour and a 3-point bending test for out-of-plane have
   been conducted while maintaining the area fraction for the laser-treated
   area. Close-type laser patterns, e.g., 0 degrees, auxetic, and
   honeycomb, not only induce a substantial increase in strength but also
   enhance bending resistance without sacrificing the springback tendency
   of the initial sheet material.}},

Title = {{SYNCHRONY BETWEEN SINGLE-UNIT ACTIVITY AND LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS IN
   RELATION TO PERIODICITY CODING IN PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{227-245}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. We recorded responses from 136 single units and the corresponding
   local field potentials (LFPs) from the same electrode al 44 positions in
   the primary auditory cortex of 25 juvenile, ketamine-anesthetized cats
   in response to periodic click trains with click repetition rates between
   1 and 32 Hz; to Poisson-distributed click trains with an average click
   rate of 4 Hz; and under spontaneous conditions. The aim of the study is
   to evaluate the synchrony between LFPs and single-unit responses, to
   compare their coding of periodic stimuli, and to elucidate
   mechanisms-that limit this periodicity coding in primary auditory
   cortex.
   2. We obtained averaged LFPs either as click-triggered averages, the
   classical evoked potentials, or as spike-triggered averages. We
   quantified LFPs by initial negative peak-to-positive peak amplitude. In
   addition, we obtained trigger events from negativegoing level crossings
   (at similar to 2 SD below the mean) of the 100-Hz low-pass electrode
   signal. We analyzed these LFP triggers similarly to single-unit spikes.
   3. The average ratio of the LFP amplitude in response to the second
   click in a train and the LFP amplitude to the first click as a function
   of click rate was low-pass with a slight resonance at similar to 10 Hz,
   and, above that frequency, decreasing with a slope of similar to 24
   dB/octave. We found the 50\% point at similar to 16 Hz. In contrast, the
   LFP amplitude averaged over entire click trains was low-pass with a
   similar resonance but a high-frequency slope of 12 dB/ octave and a 50\%
   point at similar to 12 Hz.
   4. The LFP amplitude for click repetition rates between 5 and 11 Hz
   often showed augmentation, i.e., the amplitude increased in response to
   the first few clicks in the train and thereafter decreased. This
   augmentation was paralleled by an increase in the probability of firing
   in single units simultaneously recorded on the same electrode.
   5. We calculated temporal modulation transfer functions (tMTFs) for
   single-unit spikes and for LFP triggers. They were typically bandpass
   with a best modulating frequency of 10 Hz and similar shape for both
   single-unit spikes and LFP triggers. The tMTF per click, obtained by
   dividing the tMTF by the number of clicks in the train, was low-pass
   with a 50\% cutoff frequency at similar to 12 Hz, similar to that for
   the average LFP amplitude.
   6. The close similarity of the tMTFs for single-unit spikes and LFP
   triggers suggests that single-unit tMTFs can be predicted from LFP level
   crossings. The average ratio of the tMTF for single-unit spikes and LFP
   triggers was 0.38 +/- 0.25 (SD). Cross-correlations between single-unit
   spikes and LFP triggers showed a mean peak at a lag of 1.6 +/- 3.2 (SD)
   ms, a mean peak width of 13.9 +/- 7.7 (SD) ms, and a mean efficacy of
   0.21 +/- 0.28 (SD).
   7. We calculated first-order Poisson kernels between clicks and
   single-unit spikes, and LFP triggers and LFPs. Kernels were generally
   similar in shape for single-unit spikes and LFP triggers. The sequence
   of activation and suppression around the mean firing rate could
   generally be predicted from the waveform of the integrated click-evoked
   LFP. Poisson kernels accurately predicted the presence and salience of
   rebounds in single-unit responses to click train stimuli.
   8. Spike-triggered average LFPs were similar under Poisson click
   stimulation and spontaneous conditions. Their integrated waveforms,
   called average compound excitation potentials, lacked the strong
   excitatory rebounds of the click-evoked LFPs and the single-unit firing
   patterns.
   9. Double click transfer functions provided insufficient information to
   predict the response to successive clicks in periodic click trains for
   repetition frequencies in the range of 5-11 Hz, i.e., in the
   augmentation region. In contrast, the prediction for repetition rates <5
   Hz and >12 Hz was quite accurate.
   10. Predicting the double-click modulation transfer function on the
   basis of first- and second-order Poisson kernels calculated from the
   response to Poisson-distributed click trains was impossible. A good
   prediction was, however, obtained for the average LFP amplitude
   modulation transfer function up to repetition rates of similar to 16 Hz.
   The discrepancy for repetition rates >16 Hz suggests that the system has
   a much higher nonlinearity than second order and/or that the parameters
   of the system change during prolonged stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{The object of this research is the design of pneulastics, initially
   flat, pneumatically activated stretchable membranes with areas of
   differentiated thickness- and therefore elasticity- that respond with a
   different expansion rate and create complex tension conditions on their
   surface when sealed and pneumatically inflated. Previous work
   {[}1],{[}2],{[}4] has already shown interest in the analysis and
   acquisition of control over the geometry of inflatable structures, by
   introducing tension conditions upon the uniform pressure stresses, by
   means of additional third members other than air and membrane that raise
   the complexity of the structure. Other precedents {[}3] manage to embody
   constraints in pneumatic activation, laying emphasis on the activation
   itself rather than the final shape. Pneulastics introduce the
   integration of active material strategies in order to encode the
   differentiated activation into one single skin. With a series of
   physical experimentations that confirm the initial hypothesis, that
   pneulastics can provide a wide range of doubly curved shapes, we
   empirically decipher and describe material behaviour into digital
   simulation. Starting with a target shape input, our design method
   translates curvature and topology into flat membrane configuration that
   may lead upon inflation to the best approximation of the initial shape.}},

Title = {{Low-energy drop weight performance of cellular sandwich panels}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{433-442}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The aim of this study is to perform a comparative study on
   sandwich structures with several types of three-dimensional (3D)
   reticulate cellular structural core designs for their low-energy impact
   absorption abilities using powder bed additive manufacturing methods. 3D
   reticulate cellular structures possess promising potentials in various
   applications with sandwich structure designs. One of the properties
   critical to the sandwich structures in applications, such as aerospace
   and automobile components, is the low-energy impact performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - Sandwich samples of various designs,
   including re-entrant auxetic, rhombic, hexagonal and octahedral, were
   designed and fabricated via selective laser sintering (SLS) process
   using nylon 12 as material. Low-energy drop weight test was performed to
   evaluate the energy absorption of various designs. Tensile coupons were
   also produced using the same process to provide baseline material
   properties. The manufacturing issues such as geometrical accuracy and
   anisotropy effect as well as their effects on the performance of the
   structures were discussed.
   Findings - In general, 3D reticulate cellular structures made by SLS
   process exhibit significantly different characteristics under low-energy
   drop weight impact compared to the regular extruded honeycomb sandwich
   panels. A hexagonal sandwich panel exhibits the largest compliance with
   the smallest energy absorption ability, and an octahedral sandwich panel
   exhibits high stiffness as well as good impact protection ability.
   Through a proper geometrical design, the re-entrant auxetic sandwich
   panels could achieve a combination of high energy absorption and low
   response force, making it especially attractive for low-impact
   protection applications.
   Originality/value - There has been little work on the comparative study
   of the energy absorption of various 3D reticulate cellular structures to
   date. This work demonstrates the potential of 3D reticulate cellular
   structures as sandwich cores for different purposes. This work also
   demonstrates the possibility of controlling the performance of this type
   of sandwich structures via geometrical and process design of the
   cellular cores with powder bed additive manufacturing systems.}},

Abstract = {{The current-voltage characteristics of the Ni/InAlN/GaN Schottky diodes
   were measured at various temperatures in the range of 300-820 K. The
   experimental data were analyzed considering different current-transport
   mechanisms, such as thermionic emission, generation-recombination,
   tunneling and leakage currents. From the fitting of experimental data it
   follows that the tunneling current dominates in whole temperature range.
   The thermionic emission becomes comparable to the tunneling current only
   at highest temperatures used. The barrier height of the Ni/InAlN/GaN
   Schottky diodes, evaluated from the thermionic emission current, shows a
   slightly negative temperature coefficient and its value at 300 K is 1.47
   eV. Lower barrier heights were reported before, which follow from an
   incorrect evaluation of measured data without separation of individual
   current components. The dislocation density of about 2 x 10(9) cm(-2) is
   obtained assuming dislocation governed tunneling current mechanism. (c)

Abstract = {{To assess interchangeability of estimates of bacterial abundance by
   different epifluorescence microscopy methods, total bacterial numbers
   (TBNs) determined by most widely accepted protocols were statistically
   compared. Bacteria in a set of distinctive samples were stained with
   acridine orange (AO), 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and BacLight
   and enumerated by visual counting (VC) and supervised image analysis
   (IA). Model II regression and Bland-Altman analysis proved general
   agreements between IA and VC methods, although IA counts tended to be
   lower than VC counts by 7\% on a logarithmic scale. Distributions of
   cells and latex beads on polycarbonate filters were best fitted to
   negative binomial models rather than to Poisson or log-normal models.
   The fitted models revealed higher precisions of TBNs by the IA method
   than those by the VC method. In pairwise comparisons of the staining
   methods, TBNs by AO and BacLight staining showed good agreement with
   each other, but DAPI staining had tendencies of underestimation.
   Although precisions of the three staining methods were comparable to one
   another (intraclass correlation coefficients, 0.97 to 0.98), accuracy of
   the DAPI staining method was rebutted by disproportionateness of TBNs
   between pairs of samples that carried 2-fold different volumes of
   identical cell suspensions. It was concluded that the TBN values
   estimated by AO and BacLight staining are relatively accurate and
   interchangeable for quantitative interpretation and that IA provides
   better precision than does VC. As a prudent measure, it is suggested to
   avoid use of DAPI staining for comparative studies investigating
   accuracy of novel cell-counting methods.}},

   transfer more heat at the expense of lower pressure loss. Numerical
   results reveal better thermal performances of multi-re-entrant
   honeycombs over hexagon and re-entrant topologies, attributed to the

Abstract = {{Background: Motorized traffic may discourage people walking. This study
   analyses the influence of motorization on pedestrian mobility in the
   neighbourhoods of a European city, controlling for environmental,
   socio-demographic, mobility and road safety characteristics of the
   neighbourhood in which each trip was made. Methods: Cross-sectional
   ecological study using the 38 neighbourhoods of Barcelona as the unit of
   analysis. Mobility information was obtained from the 2006 Daily Mobility
   Survey. Walking rates were calculated for 32.343 men and women who made
   walking trips, per 1000 men and women who made trips in the 38
   neighbourhoods. Data were aggregated to calculate the total number of
   motorized trips made in each neighbourhood. beta coefficients and their
   confidence intervals were calculated using Poisson regression, in order
   to study the relationship between walking and motorization, in the
   different tertiles of motorization and adjusting for contextual factors
   and their corresponding interactions with motorization. Results: Levels
   of motorization in the neighbourhood negatively influence walking, even
   when environmental variables of the neighbourhood are considered. In men
   we observe a gradient whereby walking rates fall as motorization rises
   (beta = -0.248; P < 0.001 and beta = -0.363; P < 0.001 in the second and
   third quartiles of motorization, respectively). In the case of women we
   find that only high levels of motorization have a negative influence on
   the rates of women who walk. (beta = -0.256; P < 0.001). Conclusion:
   Motorized traffic discourages people walking. Motorization is a
   modifiable environment-related factor which should be taken into account
   when designing policies to promote safe active travel.}},

Abstract = {{We use a coupled petrological-thermomechanical model to investigate the
   dynamical effects of metamorphic reactions and melting on the seismic
   structure of thermal-chemical plumes beneath volcanic arcs. Plume
   generation is driven by the subduction of buoyant crustal rocks and
   expulsion of aqueous slab fluids that causes hydration and partial
   melting of the mantle wedge. The model demonstrates two chemically
   distinct types of plumes. Unmixed plumes initiate from the melting front
   within the mantle that arises as a consequence of infiltration of
   slab-derived water-rich fluids, whereas mixed plumes initiate from the
   slab itself and entrain both slab- and mantle-derived magmas. Mixed
   plumes explain magmas such as adakites with crustal signatures, while
   primitive arc tholeiites are attributed to unmixed plumes. As a
   consequence of the interplay between water content and temperature both
   positive and negative seismic velocity anomalies are associated with the
   plumes. Positive anomalies are prevalent close to the slab due to the
   lowered temperatures associated with regions of cold plume initiation.
   Negative seismic anomalies develop at shallower depth due to the
   partially molten rocks that form plume heads. Flat lying partially
   molten regions that form beneath volcanic arcs as a consequence of cold
   wet plumes are manifest by > 20\% variations in the local Poisson ratio,
   as compared to variations of similar to 2\% expected as a consequence of
   temperature variation within the mantle wedge. In contrast to models
   that attribute a purely thermal origin for mantle wedge seismic
   anomalies, the petrological-thermomechanical model is able to explain
   the strong seismic velocity variations existing beneath volcanic arcs.

   A Population-Based Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of malocclusion
   on the quality of life (QOL) of adolescents in Brazil. We carried out a
   cross-sectional study in a sample population of 1015 schoolchildren aged
   12 to 15 years from Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil. The explanatory variable
   was malocclusion, evaluated on the basis of the normative need or the
   adolescent's self-perceived need for dental treatment. Normative need
   for dental treatment was determined by professional diagnosis, made on
   the basis of Angle's classification, the Dental Aesthetic Index, and
   other morphological deviations (e.g., posterior crossbite, posterior
   open bite, and deep overbite). We analyzed the impact of malocclusion on
   the QOL using the Portuguese version of the Oral Health Impact
   Profile-14. Associations were estimated by using the prevalence ratio
   (PR) in Poisson regression analysis, with hierarchized modeling. An
   alpha of 5\% was adopted as the criterion for statistical significance.
   The QOL of adolescents was impacted by malocclusion, classified by a
   normative need for treatment according to the Dental Aesthetic Index (PR
   = 1.27; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.03-1.56) or by the
   self-perceived need for treatment (PR = 2.54; 95\% CI = 1.81-3.56).
   Certain sociodemographic variables, including the head of the family (PR
   = 1.52; 95\% CI = 1.02-2.23), greater educational level of the head of
   the family (PR = 0.32; 95\% CI = 0.17-0.61), and female sex (PR = 1.40;
   95\% CI = 1.05-1.89), had negative associations with QOL. We conclude
   that malocclusion has a negative impact on the QOL of adolescents,
   associated with socioeconomic conditions and the cosmetic effects of
   malocclusion.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. To assess the impact of a novel, silver-coated needleless
   connectors (NCs) on central-line-associated bloodstream infection
   (CLABSI) rates compared with a mechanically identical NCs without a
   silver coating.
   DESIGN. Prospective longitudinal observation study
   SETTING. Two 500-bed university hospitals
   PATIENTS. All hospitalized adults from November 2009 to June 2011 with
   non-hemodialysis central lines
   INTERVENTIONS. Hospital A started with silver-coated NCs and switched to
   standard NCs in September 2010; hospital B started with standard NCs and
   switched to silver-coated NCs. The primary outcome was the difference
   revealed by Poisson multivariate regression in CLABSI rate using
   standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance
   definitions. The secondary outcome was a comparison of organism-specific
   CLABSI rates by NC type.
   RESULTS. Among 15,845 hospital admissions, 140,186 central-line days and
   221 CLABSIs were recorded during the study period. In a multivariate
   model, the CLABSI rate per 1,000 central-line days was lower with
   silver-coated NCs than with standard NCs (1.21 vs 1.79; incidence rate
   ratio = 0.68 {[}95\% CI: 0.52-0.89], P=.005). A lower CLABSI rate per
   1,000 central-line days for the silver-coated NCs versus the standard
   NCs was observed with S. aureus (0.11 vs 0.30, P=.02), enterococci (0.10
   vs 0.27, P=.03), and Gram-negative organisms (0.28 vs 0.63, P=.003) but
   not with coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.31 vs 0.36) or Candida spp.
   (0.42 vs 0.40).
   CONCLUSIONS. The use of silver-coated NCs decreased the CLABSI rate by
   32\%. CLABSI reduction efforts should include efforts to minimize
   contamination of NCs.}},

Abstract = {{In this population-based retrospective study, we sought to investigate
   the association between HIV/AIDS during pregnancy and adverse birth
   outcomes, including low birth weight (LBW), very low birth weight
   (VLBW), preterm birth (PTB), very preterm birth (VPTB), and small for
   gestational age (SGA), among women in Florida by socio-demographic
   variables. Using data from Florida's maternally linked birth cohort
   files, we examined singleton live births in the state during 1998 to
   2007 (N = 1,698,107). The study population was categorized based on the
   maternal HIV/AIDS status. Poisson regression models were used to
   generate adjusted rate ratios (ARR) to estimate the association between
   HIV/AIDS status and fetal growth parameters. The main outcome measures
   were fetal growth parameters, including LBW, VLBW, PTB, VPTB, and SGA.
   As compared to HIV/AIDS-negative women, mothers with HIV/AIDS had
   elevated risks for LBW (ARR = 1.40; 95\% CI = 1.30-1.50), VLBW (ARR =
   1.25; 95\% CI = 1.04-1.51), SGA (ARR = 1.26; 95\% CI = 1.17-1.35), PTB
   (ARR = 1.23; 95\% CI = 1.03-1.47), and VPTB (ARR = 1.27; 95\% CI =
   1.20-1.36). Risk estimates for LBW and SGA were highest among Hispanics
   mothers with HIV/AIDS, while white mothers with HIV/AIDS had the highest
   risk levels for VLBW and PTB, compared to their HIV/AIDS negative
   counterparts. Our findings show that women with HIV/AIDS have elevated
   risks for inhibited fetal growth and shortened gestation with important
   racial/ethnic variation. This is the first known population-based study
   that reveals racial/ethnic differences in HIV/AIDS-related fetal growth
   morbidity outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore the associations between self reported high risk
   sexual behaviours and subsequent diagnosis with hepatitis C virus (HCV)
   infection.
   Methods: The Sex, Health and Anti-Retrovirals Project (SHARP) was a
   cross sectional study of sexual behaviour in HIV positive, men who have
   sex with men (MSM) attending a London outpatient clinic. From July 1999
   to August 2000 participants completed a computer assisted self interview
   questionnaire (CASI) on recent sexual behaviour, recreational drug use,
   and detailed reporting of the last two sexual episodes involving
   different partners. Results were combined with routine clinic data and
   subsequent testing for HCV up to 21 April 2005. A new HCV diagnosis was
   defined as anti-HCV antibody seroconversion or positive HCV RNA
   following a previous negative. Incident rate ratios (IRR) were
   calculated using Poisson regression in Stata (version 9). Men
   contributed time at risk from interview until either their diagnosis or
   their last negative test result.
   Results: Of the 422 men who completed questionnaires, 308 (73\%) had
   sufficient clinical and HCV testing data available for analysis.
   Incident HCV infection was identified in 11 men. Unprotected anal
   intercourse, more than 30 sex partners in the past year, higher numbers
   of new anal sex partners, rimming (oro-anal sex), fisting, use of sex
   toys, and intranasal recreational drug use were associated with HCV. In
   multivariate analysis only fisting remained associated with HCV
   (adjusted IRR 6.27, p = 0.005).
   Conclusions: In this study of HIV positive MSM, fisting is strongly
   associated with HCV infection. Where individuals report high risk sexual
   behaviours, clinicians should offer appropriate testing for HCV
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{This work discusses the advantages of micropolar theory in modeling
   anisotropic composite materials with microstructure. A homogenized
   constitutive model starting from a representative volume element is
   proposed in order to find an equivalent continuum. Classical (e.g.,
   Cauchy of Grade 1) continua are not always suitable to accurately
   approximate the behavior of such composites because no size effects, nor
   lack of symmetries in strain and stress, can be taken into account. This
   study focuses on composites made of hexagonal rigid particles which
   interact among themselves through elastic interfaces, so that the
   deformation energy of the material is concentrated only at the
   interfaces. Three particle geometries are investigated such as
   orthotetragonal, auxetic, and chiral. Novel results have been achieved
   by presenting the behavior of panels with various material symmetries
   and subjected to concentrated loads.}},

Abstract = {{Some researchers have hypothesised that meteorological factors may have
   an impact on acute cerebrovascular diseases. The aim of this study was
   to determine an impact of some meteorological factors on occurrence of
   acute cerebrovascular events in the middle-aged Kaunas population.
   Kaunas stroke register data were used. Data on meteorological factors
   for the time period from 2000 to 2010 were obtained from the Lithuanian
   Hydrometeorological Service Kaunas Meteorological Station. We analysed
   4038 cases with stroke. Ischemic strokes composed 80.4\% and
   haemorrhagic strokes-19.6\%. According to Poisson regression analysis,
   significant negative correlation between ischemic, haemorrhagic and all
   types of stroke and ambient air temperature was found (beta coefficient
   -0.007, -0.016, -0.009, p < 0.001, respectively). Results of ARIMA
   showed that ambient temperature of the day of stroke onset was
   associated with the occurrence of ischemic, haemorrhagic and all types
   of stroke: when temperature was lower, the risk of stroke was higher
   (-0.006, -0.003, -0.009, p < 0.001, respectively). Low temperature on
   the event day and 1 and 2 days before the event was associated with
   higher incidence of haemorrhagic stroke in women. Low ambient
   temperature on the event day increased incidence of haemorrhagic stroke
   in subjects 55-64 years. High wind speed on the event day was associated
   with higher incidence of ischemic stroke in older subjects.
   Meteorological factors may have some impact on the risk of acute
   cerebrovascular events. Health care providers should focus on preventive
   measures, which can reduce these risks.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper was to assess sex and socioeconomic
   inequalities in lung cancer mortality in two major cities of Europe and
   South America. Official information on mortality and population allowed
   the estimation of sex- and age-specific death rates for Barcelona, Spain
   and Sao Paulo, Brazil (1995-2003). Mortality trends and levels were
   independently assessed for each city and subsequently compared. Rate
   ratios assessed by Poisson regression analysis addressed hypotheses of
   association between the outcome and socioeconomic covariates (human
   development index, unemployment and schooling) at the inner-city area
   level. Barcelona had a higher mortality in men (76.9/100000 inhabitants)
   than Sao Paulo (38.2/100 000 inhabitants); although rates were
   decreasing for the former (-2\%/year) and levelled-off for the {[}after.
   Mortality in women ranked similarly (9.1 for Barcelona, 11.5 for Sao
   Paulo); with an increasing trend for women aged 35-64 years (+
   7.7\%/year in Barcelona and + 2.4\%/year in Sao Paulo). The
   socioeconomic gradient of mortality in men was negative for Barcelona
   and positive for Sao Paulo; for women, the socioeconomic gradient was
   positive in both cities. Negative gradients indicate that deprived areas
   suffer a higher burden of disease; positive gradients suggest that
   prosmoking lifestyles may have been more prevalent in more affluent
   areas during the last decades. Sex and socioeconomic inequalities of
   lung cancer mortality reinforce the hypothesis that the epidemiologic
   profile of cancer can be improved by an expanded access to existing
   technology of healthcare and prevention. The continuous monitoring of
   inequalities in health may contribute to the concurrent promotion of
   well-being and social justice.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To provide a broad and up-to-date picture of the effect of
   antiretroviral therapy (ART) provision on population-level mortality in
   Southern and East Africa. Methods Data on all-cause, AIDS and non-AIDS
   mortality among 1559 year olds were analysed from demographic
   surveillance sites (DSS) in Karonga (Malawi), Kisesa (Tanzania), Masaka
   (Uganda) and the Africa Centre (South Africa), using Poisson regression.
   Trends over time from up to 5 years prior to ART roll-out, to 46 years
   afterwards, are presented, overall and by age and sex. For Masaka and
   Kisesa, trends are analysed separately for HIV-negative and HIV-positive
   individuals. For Karonga and the Africa Centre, trends in AIDS and
   non-AIDS mortality are analysed using verbal autopsy data. Results For
   all-cause mortality, overall rate ratios (RRs) comparing the period 26
   years following ART roll-out with the pre-ART period were 0.58 (5.9 vs.
   10.2 deaths per 1000 person-years) in Karonga, 0.79 (7.2 vs. 9.1 deaths
   per 1000 person-years) in Kisesa, 0.61 (6.7 compared with 11.0 deaths
   per 1000 person-years) in Masaka and 0.79 (14.8 compared with 18.6
   deaths per 1000 person-years) in the Africa Centre DSS. The mortality
   decline was seen only in HIV-positive individuals/AIDS mortality, with
   no decline in HIV-negative individuals/non-AIDS mortality. Less
   difference was seen in Kisesa where ART uptake was lower. Conclusions
   Falls in all-cause mortality are consistent with ART uptake. The largest
   falls occurred where ART provision has been decentralised or available
   locally, suggesting that this is important.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1991 and mid 2000, the surveillance of Bovine Spongiform
   Encephalopathy (BSE) in France was based solely on clinical surveillance
   through a Mandatory Reporting System. Since 2000, the implementation of
   active surveillance programmes using rapid tests, as a complementary
   tool targeted at dead and slaughtered cattle has shown that part of the
   BSE cases were not detected with the clinical surveillance. In order to
   obtain a better knowledge of the strength of the clinical surveillance,
   we analysed a vigilance index defined as the ratio of negative clinical
   suspicions to the cattle population in the region and period of
   interest. The temporal analysis of the vigilance index showed that it
   did not vary much between 1991 and 1999, increased sharply since 2000,
   and then decreased partly in 2001. The geographical analysis of the
   variations of the vigilance index was performed at the department level
   by comparing the observed number of negative clinical suspicions per
   department to the expected number, computed on the basis of the national
   average index and standardised on the production type of the
   cattle-dairy versus beef suckling cattle. As assumed, the data followed
   a Poisson distribution. We observed a high geographical variation of the
   vigilance index: ten departments out of 91 presented a significantly
   higher vigilance index than the national one, and four a significantly
   lower vigilance index. The vigilance index showed that the clinical
   surveillance was heterogeneous during the past twelve years, both in
   time and geographic location, in a range of one to ten. So the apparent
   trend in the BSE epidemic during this period as well as the differences
   in the spatial incidence of BSE have to be analysed with caution.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In most countries, the financial service sector has

   a Brazilian state bank in 2008. The presence of MPD was determined by
   the General Health Questionnaire.(GHQ). Psychosocial work conditions
   were assessed by means of the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) and Job
   Content Questionnaire (JCQ). The presence and magnitude of the
   independent associations between MPD and adverse psychosocial working
   conditions were determined by Prevalence Ratios, obtained by Poisson
   regression.
   Results: From 2,337 eligible workers, 88\% participated. The prevalence
   of MPD was greater among women (45\% vs. 41\%; p > 0.05). In the
   multivariate analysis, the prevalence of MPD was twice as high among
   bank workers exposed to high psychological demand and low control at
   work and under high effort and low reward working conditions. The lack
   of social support at work and the presence of over-commitment were also
   associated with higher prevalence of MPD. A negative interaction effect
   was found between over-commitment and effort-reward imbalance.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of MPD is high among bank workers. The
   results reinforce the association between MPD and adverse psychosocial
   working conditions, assessed by the JCQ and ERI models. The direction of
   the interaction observed between over-commitment and ERI was contrary to
   what was expected.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The effects of use of different types of hormone therapy on
   breast cancer risk according to prognostic factors are largely unknown.
   Methods: We linked data from the Norwegian Prescription Database and the
   Cancer Registry of Norway during 2004 to 2009 on all women ages 45 to 79
   years (N = 686,614). We estimated rate ratios and 95\% confidence
   intervals for breast cancer in relation to hormone therapy using Poisson
   regression.
   Results: During an average 4.8 years of follow-up, 7,910 invasive breast
   cancers were diagnosed. Compared with nonusers of hormone therapy, users
   of estradiol and tibolone were more likely to be diagnosed with grade I,
   lymph node-negative, and estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/progesterone
   receptor-positive (PR+) tumors. However, compared with nonusers, users
   of the most common estrogen and progestin combinations
   {[}estradiol-norethisterone acetate (NETA) preparations (Kliogest,
   Activelle or Trisekvens)] were at a 4-to 5-fold elevated risk of grade I
   tumors, 3-fold elevated risk of lymph node-negative tumors, and 3-to
   4-fold elevated risk of ER+/PR+ tumors. Importantly, estradiol-NETA
   users were also at a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of medium
   differentiated (grade II) tumors and tumors with lymph node involvement.
   Conclusions: Use of oral estradiol, tibolone, and estradiol-NETA
   predominantly increases the risk of breast cancer with favorable
   prognosis characteristics. However, use of estradiol-NETA preparations
   also increases the risk of breast cancers with less favorable
   characteristics.
   Impact: The hormone therapy preparations most commonly used in the
   Nordic countries are associated with both breast cancers with good and
   less favorable prognosis characteristics. (C) 2016 AACR.}},

   Coupled Drive System}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Motor-transmission coupled drive system is attractive for battery and
   hybrid electric vehicles. In such a system, the motor rotor is directly
   connected to the transmission input shaft and the active-synchronization
   technique is implemented to assist the speed synchronization; therefore,
   the gear-shifting characteristics are different from those of
   traditional manual and automated mechanical transmissions. In this work,
   we present a methodology for modeling the gear-shifting process and
   analyzing its characteristics in a motor-transmission coupled drive
   system. We treat the engaging of sleeve and desired clutch gear as a
   two-phase process-sleeve first interacting with synchro ring and then
   with clutch gear, respectively, and investigate all possible interaction
   ways in each phase. The movement of each part is governed by multibody
   dynamics, and the speed jumps caused by shifting impacts are described
   using the Poisson coefficient of restitution. We then develop a hybrid
   automaton (HA) model to couple the continuous-time evolutions and the
   discrete transitions of state variables, which cover all interaction
   ways of sleeve, synchro ring, and clutch gear. Based on this model, we
   carry out simulations in MATLAB to analyze the effects of two control
   parameters-the relative rotational speed of sleeve and desired clutch
   gear, and the shifting force-on shifting performance. Simulation and
   bench test results show that the optimal control parameters are located
   in the domain where the relative rotational speed is negative with small
   absolute value, which means the sleeve will not be locked out by synchro
   ring and can engage with the desired clutch gear smoothly.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to numerically study the equilibrium characteristics of
   the ionic inter-diffusion processes in ion exchange membrane systems
   under bi-ionic conditions as a function of the membrane fixed-charge
   concentration and the thickness of the diffusion boundary layers
   adjacent to the membrane. The considered particular system is
   constituted by a membrane with negative fixed charge and two identical
   diffusion boundary layers on both sides of the membrane. The system is
   bathed by two solutions with a common co-ion but different counter ion.
   The ionic transport processes of a ternary electrolyte are described by
   the Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations not only in the membrane but also in
   the diffusion layers, including the electric double layers at the
   interfaces. The ionic concentrations and electric potential profiles
   have been numerically obtained using the network simulation method in a
   permeable membrane system where the co-ion flux is a significant
   fraction of the counter ionic fluxes. The effect of the diffusion
   boundary layers on the equilibrium membrane potential, the ionic fluxes
   and the ionic concentration profiles inside the membrane have been
   analysed and discussed.}},

Journal = {{ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Evidence supports vancomycin therapeutic-drug monitoring by area under
   the concentration-time curve (AUC), but data to establish an AUC upper
   limit are limited and published nephrotoxicity thresholds range widely.
   The objective of this analysis was to examine the association between
   initial vancomycin AUC and nephrotoxicity. This was a multicenter,
   retrospective cohort study of adult patients receiving intravenous
   vancomycin from 2014 to 2015. Nephrotoxicity was defined as a serum
   creatinine increase of 0.5 mg/liter and 50\% from baseline on
   consecutive measurements. Vancomycin exposure profile during the initial
   48 h of therapy was estimated using maximum a posteriori probability
   Bayesian estimation. Vancomycin AUC and minimum-concentration (C-min)
   thresholds most strongly associated with nephrotoxicity were identified
   via classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Predictive
   performances of CART-derived and other candidate AUC thresholds was
   assessed through positive and negative predictive value and receiver
   operating characteristic curves. Poisson regression was used to quantify
   the association between exposure thresholds and nephrotoxicity while
   adjusting for confounders. Among 323 patients included, nephrotoxicity
   was significantly higher in patients with AUCs from 0 to 48 h
   (AUC(0-48)) of >= 1,218 mg . h/liter, AUC(0-24) of >= 677 mg . h/liter,
   AUC(24-48) of >= 683 mg . h/liter, and day 1 C-min (C-min24) of >= 18.8
   mg/liter. Vancomycin exposure in excess of these thresholds was
   associated with a 3-to 4-fold-increased risk of nephrotoxicity in
   Poisson regression. The predictive performance of AUC for nephrotoxicity
   was maximized at daily AUC values between 600 and 800 mg . h/liter.
   Although these data support an AUC range for vancomycin-associated
   nephrotoxity rather than a single threshold, available evidence suggests
   that a daily AUC limit of 700 mg . h/liter is reasonable.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To compare the 10-year outcome (disease activity, disability,
   mortality) of two cohorts of patients with inflammatory polyarthritis
   (IP) recruited 10 years apart.
   Methods Patients with IP were recruited to the Norfolk Arthritis
   Register from 1990 to 1994 (cohort 1 (C1)) and from 2000 to 2004 (cohort
   2 (C2)). Demographic and clinical data were collected at baseline and at
   years 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. Longitudinal disease activity
   (swollen/tender 51 joint counts (SJC51/TJC51)) and disability (Health
   Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)) were compared between the cohorts using
   population-average negative binomial regression and generalised
   estimating equation analysis, respectively. Risk of 10-year mortality
   was compared between cohorts using Cox models. Risk of cardiovascular
   disease (CVD) mortality was compared between cohorts using competing
   risks analysis. Mortality rate ratios (MRR), adjusted for changes in
   mortality risk of the general population, were calculated using Poisson
   regression.
   Results In total 1653 patients were recruited (C1=1022, C2=631).
   Patients in C2 had 17\% lower SJC51 than C1 over 10 years (95\%CI -23\%
   to -10\%), whereas TJC51 and HAQ were comparable. C2 patients had
   reduced risk of all-cause and CVD mortality compared with C1 (all-cause:
   HR 0.72, 95\%CI 0.56 to 0.95; CVD: subhazard ratio 0.58, 95\%CI 0.37 to
   0.93). After accounting for changes in mortality risk in the general
   population, the difference in mortality was non-significant (all-cause:
   MRR 0.78, 95\%CI 0.56 to 1.10; CVD: MRR 0.77, 95\%CI 0.48 to 1.24).
   Conclusion Disease activity significantly improved in the new
   millennium, whereas disability and mortality were unchanged.}},

Title = {{The epidemiology of regional and widespread musculoskeletal pain in

Abstract = {{Objectives: To examine whether the prevalence of regional and chronic
   widespread pain (CWP) varies with rurality and to determine the
   characteristics of persons in rural locations in whom pain is found to
   be in excess.
   Methods: Participants, aged >= 55 years, from participating general
   practices in seven different geographical locations in Scotland were
   sent a postal questionnaire. The 1-month prevalence of 10 regional pain
   conditions plus CWP was identified using body manikins. Differences in
   the prevalence of pain with differing rurality were examined using
   Chi(2) test for trend. Thereafter, among the rural population, the
   relationships between pain and putative risk factors were examined using
   Poisson regression. Thus, results are described as risk ratios.
   Results: There was some evidence to suggest that the prevalence of CWP
   increased with increasing rurality, although the magnitude of this was
   slight. No large or significant differences were observed with any
   regional pain conditions. Factors associated with the reporting of CWP
   included poor general health, feeling downhearted most of the time and
   selected measures of social contact. Factors independently associated
   with CWP included female gender (risk ratio: 1.24; 95\% confidence
   interval (CI): 0.997-1.55), poor self-rated health (risk ratio: 3.50;
   95\% CI: 1.92-6.39) and low mood (risk ratio: 1.54; 95\% CI: 1.07-2.20).
   Also, having fewer than 10 people to turn to in a crisis was associated
   with a decrease in the risk of CWP - risk ratio: 0.68 (95\% CI:
   0.50-0.93) and 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.60-1.02) for those with 5-10 and <5
   people, respectively.
   Conclusions: This study provides no evidence that the prevalence of
   regional musculoskeletal pain is increased in rural settings, although
   there is some evidence of a modest increase in CWP. Risk factors for CWP
   are similar to those seen in the urban setting, including markers of
   general health, mental health and also aspects of social contact. It may
   be, however, that social networks are more difficult to maintain in
   rural settings, and clinicians should be aware of the negative effect of
   perceived social isolation on pain in rural areas.}},

Abstract = {{The theory of osmosis and reverse osmosis in fine-porous charged
   membranes and diaphragms is presented in a deductive way with several
   well-structured levels of consideration. The analysis starts from the
   discontinuous version of irreversible thermodynamics where the membrane
   is considered as an absolutely black box without any information needed
   about its internal structure. As a trade-off for generality, however,
   the thermodynamic forces must be small. A number of qualitative
   conclusions is drawn proceeding from rather evident assumptions about
   the order of magnitude of various phenomenological coefficients. In the
   case of electrolyte mixtures those conclusions turn out surprisingly
   numerous and non-trivial including predictions of reflection
   coefficients larger than unity and strong negative osmosis. Both those
   anomalous phenomena are confirmed by experimental findings.
   The next step is the introduction of a `uniformly black' box, namely a
   macroscopically homogeneous membrane with otherwise unspecified internal
   structure. That permits to employ the continuous version of irreversible
   thermodynamics thus allowing to drop the restriction of small
   thermodynamic forces. In the case of binary electrolytes general
   solutions in quadratures are obtained for the problems of apparent
   osmotic pressure and of reverse osmosis, and a very accurate approximate
   solution in quadratures is obtained for the problem of osmosis. Some of
   the theoretical predictions are compared with experimental data on the
   reverse osmosis of binary electrolytes in track-etched membranes with
   the pore size of 8 nm.
   In the case of electrolyte mixtures a semi-quantitative asymptotic
   analysis is performed in the limiting case of reverse osmosis at
   sufficiently large Peclet numbers, and in the particular case of one
   dominant electrolyte in the mixture an exact solution in quadratures is
   obtained. Those analyses make possible to predict a number of
   non-trivial regularities that are confronted with experimental data on
   the pressure-driven transport of ternary electrolyte mixtures across
   various charged porous membranes. A good qualitative agreement between
   the theory and experiments is recorded.
   The next step is the specification of phenomenological coefficients
   within the scope of a general capillary model. That makes the box grey
   but not transparent, yet, as the shape of capillary cross-section as
   well as the nature of surface forces are not specified. General
   expressions for phenomenological coefficients derived in terms of ion
   distribution and diffusion coefficients make possible a qualitative
   analysis of the effect of inhomogeneity of ion distribution inside
   pores.
   Finally, the capillary space charge model is introduced making the
   analysis completely mechanistic. Several approaches are considered to
   the approximate description of the structure of overlapped diffuse parts
   of double electric layers in fine pores. Since qualitative effects of
   microscopic heterogeneity appear to be not dependent on the details of
   the pore geometry sample numerical calculations are performed for
   slit-like capillaries where there is a general solution of
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation in quadratures. A more general model of pores
   in an electrically conducting gel is introduced in an attempt to
   quantitatively describe the results of complete characterization of
   cation-exchange membranes in terms of irreversible thermodynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Recent antimicrobial resistance data are lacking from
   inpatient oncology settings to guide infection prophylaxis and treatment
   recommendations. We describe central line-associated bloodstream
   infection (CLABSI) pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns
   reported from oncology locations to the Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).
   Methods. CLABSI data reported to NHSN from 2009 to 2012 from adult
   inpatient oncology locations were compared to data from nononcology
   adult locations within the same hospitals. Pathogen profile,
   antimicrobial resistance rates, and CLABSI incidence rates per 1000
   central line-days were calculated. CLABSI incidence rates were compared
   using Poisson regression.
   Results. During 2009-2012, 4654 CLABSIs were reported to NHSN from 299
   adult oncology units. The most common organisms causing CLABSI in
   oncology locations were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16.9\%),
   Escherichia coli (11.8\%), and Enterococcus faecium (11.4\%).
   Fluoroquinolone resistance was more common among E. coli CLABSI in
   oncology than nononcology locations (56.5\% vs 41.5\% of isolates
   tested; P < .0001) and increased significantly from 2009-2010 to
   2011-2012 (49.5\% vs 60.4\%; P = .01). Furthermore, rates of CLABSI were
   significantly higher in oncology compared to nononcology locations for
   fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli (rate ratio, 7.37; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI], 6.20-8.76) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (rate
   ratio, 2.27, 95\% CI, 2.03-2.53). However, resistance rates for some
   organisms, such as Klebsiella species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were
   lower in oncology than in nononcology locations.
   Conclusions. Antimicrobial-resistant E. coli and E. faecium have become
   significant pathogens in oncology. Practices for antimicrobial
   prophylaxis and empiric antimicrobial therapy should be regularly
   assessed in conjunction with contemporary antimicrobial resistance data.}},

Abstract = {{Although distinct categories of male genital malformations share some
   common risk factors, few studies have systematically compared
   epidemiologic features across phenotypes. We evaluated the relationship
   between several maternal and infant characteristics and five categories
   of male genital malformations: second- or third-degree hypospadias,
   hypospadias (regardless of degree), small penis, cryptorchidism, and any
   male genital malformation. Data for 16,813 cases with isolated male
   genital malformations and 1,945,841 male live births delivered from 1999
   to 2008 were obtained from the Texas Birth Defects Registry. For each
   phenotype category, 13 maternal and infant variables were assessed, and
   adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated based on the same
   multivariable Poisson regression model. A significant negative
   association was observed between previous live births versus no previous
   live births and four phenotypes (e.g., adjusted prevalence ratio {[}aPR]
   for any male genital malformation: 0.78, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 0.75-0.81). The prevalence of 4 of the phenotypes was
   significantly higher among multiple versus singleton pregnancies (e.g.,
   aPR for any male genital malformation: 1.35, 95\% CI: 1.25-1.47). We
   also observed significant associations between multiple phenotypes and
   residential region at delivery, delivery year, month of conception, and
   maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, and birthplace, including
   significant associations for trends (maternal age, maternal education,
   and birth year modeled ordinally). Our results allow for comparison of
   characteristics across phenotypes and suggest that there may be some
   common risk factors for multiple male genital malformations (e.g.,
   characteristics related to maternal estrogen levels), while other risk
   factors may be unique to specific defects. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. To evaluate seasonal variation in the rate of surgical site
   infections (SSI) following commonly performed surgical procedures.
   design. Retrospective cohort study.
   METHODS. We analyzed 6 years (January 1, 2007, through December 31,
   2012) of data from the 15 most commonly performed procedures in 20
   hospitals in the Duke Infection Control Outreach Network. We defined
   summer as July through September. First, we performed 3 separate Poisson
   regression analyses (unadjusted, multivariable, and polynomial) to
   estimate prevalence rates and prevalence rate ratios of SSI following
   procedures performed in summer versus nonsummer months. Then, we
   stratified our
   RESULTS to obtain estimates based on procedure type and organism type.
   Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of
   our findings. results. We identified 4,543 SSI following 441,428
   surgical procedures (overall prevalence rate, 1.03/100 procedures). The
   rate of SSI was significantly higher during the summer compared with the
   remainder of the year (1.11/100 procedures vs 1.00/100 procedures;
   prevalence rate ratio, 1.11 {[}95\% CI, 1.04-1.19]; P=.002).
   Stratum-specific SSI calculations revealed higher SSI rates during the
   summer for both spinal (P=.03) and nonspinal (P=.004) procedures and
   revealed higher rates during the summer for SSI due to either
   gram-positive cocci (P=. 006) or gram-negative bacilli (P=.004).
   Multivariable regression analysis and sensitivity analyses confirmed our
   findings.
   CONCLUSIONS. The rate of SSI following commonly performed surgical
   procedures was higher during the summer compared with the remainder of
   the year. Summer SSI rates remained elevated after stratification by
   organism and spinal versus nonspinal surgery, and rates did not change
   after controlling for other known SSI risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{Capsule Of 26 species of wintering waterbirds, 18 showed an increase in
   numbers, five showed a decrease and two showed no change.
   Aim To assess long-term trends in the numbers and distribution of the 26
   most abundant wintering waterbird species in the Czech Republic.
   Methods We used International Waterbird Census data from between 48 and
   639 wetland sites which had been counted annually in the Czech Republic
   from 1966 to 2008. From these data long-term changes in numbers and
   distributions were determined. Log-linear Poisson regression analysis
   was used to estimate missing data using TRIM software. The distribution
   of each species was described as the ratio of the number of sites
   occupied by that species to the total number of sites investigated.
   Results Increasing trends were found for 18 species, five species were
   found to be declining, one species was stable and two species were found
   with uncertain trends. Wintering distributions (the ratio of sites
   occupied by a given species to the total number of sites counted)
   increased in 16 species and decreased in two species, broadly correlated
   with the species changes in numbers.
   Conclusion In most species changes in numbers as well as changes in
   distribution followed the Western Palearctic population trends. Those
   species which increased were mainly piscivores and included geese, ducks
   and gulls. Scarcer species also exhibited an increase in numbers. The
   changes in numbers (both positive and negative) were more frequent among
   species associated with running water, whereas species which showed
   uncertain trends were more frequently recorded on standing water, which
   is more affected by variable weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{About a 100 nm thick multilayer film of nanoparticle monolayers and
   polymer layers is shown to behave like cellular-foam with a modulus
   below 100 KPa. The 1.25 cm radius film adhered to a rigid surface can be
   compressed reversibly to 60\% strain. The more than 4 orders of
   magnitude lower modulus compared to its constituents is explained by
   considering local bending in the (nano)cellular structure, similar to
   cork and wings of beetles. As the rigidity of the polymer backbone is
   increased in just four monolayers, the modulus of the composite
   increases by over 70\%. Electro-optical map of the strain distribution
   over the area of compression and increase in modulus with thickness
   indicates the films have zero Poisson's ratio.}},

Title = {{Energy efficiency analysis of ArF excimer laser system}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{The reliable functioning and continual optimizing of ArF excimer laser
   system is of importance when it comes to productization into the market
   from a laboratory test machine. The analysis of dynamic characteristics
   of the system is vital to understanding its operating mechanism and
   optimizing the design theoretically. In this article, one-dimensional
   fluid model is used to analyze the excimer laser discharge mechanism,
   and the content ratio of fluorine gas, argon gas, and neon gas, which
   constitute a gas mixture, is studied in a simulated ArF excimer laser
   system. Particles are treated as a fluid, which significantly reduces
   the computing cost in fluid model, and therefore is suitable for
   high-pressure situation. Four equations are included in one-dimensional
   fluid model, i.e., Boltzmann equation that describes electron energy
   distribution, ion continue equation that illustrates ion number density,
   Poisson's equation that shows the distribution of electric field, and
   photon rate equation that demonstrates laser outputting process. By
   combining these four equations, high pressure plasma discharge process
   and particles stimulated radiation process are studied, and calculation
   continues from one time step to another until the end of discharging
   process. The result of the calculation presents energy transfer process
   from three aspects: energy deposition efficiency, ArF{*} formation, and
   laser outputting. In the energy deposition process, the energy
   deposition efficiency is sensitive to the change of fluorine gas ratio
   while the variation of the content ratio of other two gases has a less
   influence on this process. In addition, there exists an optimal fluorine
   gas ratio that causes the highest energy deposition efficiency. In the
   ArF{*} formation process, the reaction between excited argon ions and
   fluorine gas is the main channel that generates ArF{*}. The proper
   increasing of fluorine gas ratio helps form ArF{*}. In the laser
   outputting process, photon loss is mainly because of the reaction
   between fluorine negative ions and photons. Therefore superfluous
   fluorine gas in the mixture leads to less photons, which eventually
   results in low energy efficiency of laser. By summarizing the three
   aspects of energy transfer process, the fluorine gas ratio in the gas
   mixture plays a significant role in determining the energy efficiency of
   ArF excimer laser system. This theory is verified by experiments,
   showing that the deviation of the optimized fluorine gas ratio severely
   reduces energy efficiency. This conclusion can guide us in optimizing
   the design and steady reliable function of ArF excimer laser system.}},

Title = {{Cross-like lattices with tailorable mechanical properties}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{281}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Here we propose a new 3D structure with cubic unit cells constructed by
   six 2D cross-like lattices. Applying Finite element analysis (FEA), we
   find that the mechanical properties of such 3D lattices can be
   geometrically tuned without considering different material attributes.
   The topology and volume fraction are changed by varying the deformation
   angle and strut diameter-length ratio, respectively, which both affect
   the overall stiffness. This is demonstrated by the experiments with 3D
   printed acrylate resin specimens. Interestingly, the proposed lattices
   also show a potential auxetic property and high porosity (>90\%). Such
   lattices can be used to create new materials with lightweight and
   tunable mechanical properties in tissue engineering, civil engineering,
   and aerospace industry. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of serious bleeding signals during concomitant use of
   clopidogrel and hypnotic drugs}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICINE \& PHARMACOTHERAPY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{139}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: In a previous drug-drug interaction (DDI) screening study
   intended to generate hypotheses, clopidogrel + either eszopiclone or
   zolpidem (vs. clopidogrel alone) were associated with serious bleeding.
   Objectives: To confirm or refute these DDI signals and examine
   associations with other hypnotics in an independent population of United
   States Medicaid beneficiaries Methods: We employed a bi-directional
   self-controlled case series design in eligible individuals concomitantly
   exposed to one of 12 hypnotics (precipitants, exposures of interest)
   plus either clopidogrel (the object drug) or pravastatin (the negative
   control object drug). The outcome was hospital presentation with serious
   bleeding. Using conditional Poisson regression, we calculated
   confounder-adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals for
   serious bleeding during clopidogrel + precipitant use (vs. clopidogrel
   alone). To distinguish a DDI from a precipitant's inherent effect on
   bleeding, we divided effect measures by the adjusted RR for the
   corresponding pravastatin + precipitant pair to obtain ratios of RR
   (RRRs). Results: Among 23,194 users of clopidogrel and 3824 of
   pravastatin who experienced serious bleeding during an active
   prescription for one of these agents, confounder-adjusted RRRs for
   serious bleeding were 6.63 (0.39-113.01) and 0.77 (0.53-1.11) with
   eszopiclone and zolpidem, respectively, whereas confounder-adjusted RRRs
   for other hypnotics ranged from 0.18 (0.04-0.85) for triazolam to 1.79
   (0.16-20.44) for zaleplon. Statistical imprecision therefore precluded
   us from confirming or refuting these prior signals with eszopiclone and
   zolpidem. Conclusions: While we could not confirm or refute previously
   identified DDI signals, numerically elevated RRRs for serious bleeding
   with several clopidogrel + hypnotic pairs warrant further examination.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Poor CD4 response to antiretroviral treatment (HAART) is
   associated with increased mortality. We analyzed the impact of CD4
   increase on non-AIDS-related morbidity and on mortality in HIV patients
   and their parents.
   Methods: Mortality rates were estimated among 1758 virally suppressed
   patients in the Danish HIV Cohort Study after 2 years on HAART and among
   their parents (n = 1603). Analyses were stratified by pre-HAART CD4
   count and CD4 increase. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of non-AIDS-related
   morbidity and mortality rate ratios (MRR) were analyzed using Poisson
   regression.
   Results: CD4 increases less than 25 vs. more than 100 cells/mu l was
   associated with increased mortality {[}MRR 3.5 (95\% confidence interval
   (CI) 1.8-6.8)] even in individuals with pre-HAART CD4 cell count more
   than 250 cells/mu l (MRR 3.2 (95\% CI, 1.3-7.8). Mortality of parents of
   patients with poor CD4 response was also increased {[}MRR 1.5 (95\% CI,
   1.1-2.1)]. There was a trend towards association between poor CD4
   response and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer {[}IRR
   1.6 (95\% CI, 0.8-3.2) and 1.6 (95\% CI, 0.6-4.8)].
   Conclusion: Poor CD4 increase post-HAART is associated with adverse
   prognosis even in absence of severe immunosuppression. CD4 response in
   HIV patients is associated with mortality among their parents, thus poor
   CD4 response may be caused by genetic factors, which might also affect
   morbidity and mortality in the HIV-negative population. (c) 2013 Wolters

Abstract = {{Introduction: In 2006, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination
   policy in Finland changed from universal to selective. Aim: We assessed
   the impact of the policy change on tuberculosis (TB) morbidity in
   children under 5 years and epidemiological trends of paediatric TB in
   Finland. Methods: We conducted a nationwide, population-based,
   retrospective registry study of all newly diagnosed active TB cases
   younger than 15 years in Finland from 1995 to 2015 by linking data from
   the National Infectious Diseases Register, Finnish Care Register for
   Health Care, medical patient records and Finnish Population Information
   System. We compared the TB incidence rate ratio of under 5 year-olds
   with universal and selective BCG vaccinations with a Poisson log-linear
   model and analysed incidence trends among those younger than 15 years
   with a negative binomial model. Results: We identified 139 paediatric TB
   cases: 50 native (including 24 second-generation migrants) and 89
   foreign-born children. The TB rate of under 5 year-olds remained stable
   after changing to selective BCG vaccination (incidence rate ratio (IRR):
   1.3; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.72.3). TB rate in the native
   population under 15 years increased slightly (IRR = 1.06; 95\% CI:
   1.01-1.11). Discussion: Paediatric TB cases in Finland were concentrated
   in families with migrant background from high-TB incidence countries.
   The native TB morbidity in under 5-year-olds did not increase after the
   BCG policy revision, suggesting that selective vaccinations can prevent
   TB in the most vulnerable age group in low-incidence settings.
   Second-generation migrants under 15 years in Finland with high TB risk
   are probably increasing.}},

Abstract = {{Consequences of the well-known Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) continuum
   equations of charge motion in liquids or solids for ordinary or
   anomalous diffusion are investigated for an electrochemical cell with
   completely blocking electrodes. Previous work is summarized and much of
   it is shown to be independent of earlier published results and
   incomplete, with little comparison made between ordinary and anomalous
   diffusion. Such comparison is provided here and also includes variation
   of the mobility ratio of the mobilities of positive and negative charges
   from equality to charge of only one sign mobile. New
   generation-recombination effects are demonstrated for a range of
   mobility ratios, with particular attention given to those present for
   the case of charge of only one sign mobile. No previous analyses of
   experimental data with PNP models using complex-least-squares fitting
   have been published. Here such a model is found to fit frequency
   response data well for a hydrogel and to lead to estimates of physically
   meaningful parameters such as the diffusion constant and ionic
   concentration. PNP analysis of a synthetic data set derived from
   experimental results for liquid electrolytes refutes claims made in the
   original publication dealing with it, but verifies and extends an
   interesting analysis equation proposed there. PNP fitting of data for
   solids, including ones showing colossal low-frequency-limiting
   dielectric constants, suggests that they may often be well described as
   arising from simple diffuse-charge double-layer effects, and that
   continuum microscopic models such as the PNP, in series with a
   conducting Debye response model, may be sufficient for fitting well an
   appreciable amount of data involving ion hopping and trapping behavior.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Describe the epidemiology of central line-associated
   bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) in neonatal intensive care units
   (NICUs) participating in a standardized and mandatory CLABSI
   surveillance program.
   DESIGN. Retrospective cohort.
   SETTING. We included patients admitted (April 2007-March 2011) to 7
   level II/III NICUs who developed a CLABSI (as defined by the National
   Healthcare Safety Network).
   METHODS. CLABSIs/1,000 central line-days and device utilization ratio
   were calculated; chi(2) test, Student t test, Kruskal-Wallis, and
   Poisson regression were used.
   RESULTS. Overall, 191 patients had 202 CLABSI episodes for a pooled mean
   rate of 4.0 CLABSIs/1,000 central line-days and a device utilization
   ratio of 0.20. Annual pooled mean CLABSI rates increased from 3.6 in
   2007-2008 to 5.1 CLABSIs/1,000 central line-days in 2010-2011 (P = .01).
   The all-cause 30-day case fatality proportion was 8.9\% (n = 17) and
   occurred a median of 8 days after CLABSI. Coagulase-negative
   Staphylococcus was identified in 112 (50.5\%) cases. Staphylococcus
   aureus was identified in 22 cases, and 3 (13.6\%) were resistant to
   methicillin. An underlying intra-abdominal pathology was found in 20\%
   (40/202) of CLABSI cases, 50\% of which were reported in the last year
   of study. When adjusted for mean birth weight, annual CLABSI incidence
   rates were independently associated with the proportion of
   intra-abdominal pathology (P = .007) and the proportion of pulmonary
   pathology (P = .016) reported.
   CONCLUSION. The increase in CLABSI rates in Quebec NICUs seems to be
   associated with an increased proportion of cases with underlying
   intra-abdominal and pulmonary pathologies, which needs further
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{P>Enterobacter species are the fourth most common cause of Gram-negative
   bloodstream infection (BSI). We examined temporal changes and seasonal
   variation in the incidence rate of Enterobacter spp. BSI, estimated
   28-day and 1-year mortality, and determined in vitro antimicrobial
   resistance rates of Enterobacter spp. bloodstream isolates in Olmsted
   County, Minnesota, from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2007.
   Multivariable Poisson regression was used to examine temporal changes
   and seasonal variation in incidence rate and Kaplan-Meier method was
   used to estimate 28-day and 1-year mortality. The median age of patients
   with Enterobacter spp. BSI was 58 years and 53\% were female. The
   overall age- and gender-adjusted incidence rate of Enterobacter spp. BSI
   was 3.3 per 100 000 person-years (95\% CI 2.3-4.4). There was a linear
   trend of increasing incidence rate from 0.8 (95\% CI 0-1.9) to 6.2 (95\%
   CI 3.0-9.3) per 100 000 person-years between 1998 and 2007 (p 0.002).
   There was no significant difference in the incidence rate of
   Enterobacter spp. BSI during the warmest 4 months compared to the
   remainder of the year (incidence rate ratio 1.06; 95\% CI 0.47-2.01).
   The overall 28-day and 1-year mortality rates of Enterobacter spp. BSI
   were 21\% (95\% CI 8-34\%) and 38\% (95\% CI 22-53\%), respectively. Up
   to 13\% of Enterobacter spp. bloodstream isolates were resistant to
   third-generation cephalosporins. To our knowledge, this is the first
   population-based study to describe the epidemiology and outcome of
   Enterobacter spp. BSI. The increase in incidence rate of Enterobacter
   spp. BSI over the past decade, coupled with its associated antimicrobial
   resistance, dictate the need for further investigation of this syndrome.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to introduce tunable continuous-stable
   metamaterials with reversible thermo-mechanical memory operations by
   four-dimensional (4D) printing technology. They are developed based on
   an understanding on glassy-rubbery behaviors of shape memory polymers
   and hot/cold programming derived from experiments and theory. Fused
   decomposition modeling as a well-known 3D printing technology is
   implemented to fabricate mechanical metamaterials. They are
   experimentally tested revealing elastic-plastic and hyper-elastic
   behaviors in low and high temperatures at a large deformation range. A
   computational design tool is developed by implementing a 3D
   phenomenological constitutive model coupled with a geometrically
   nonlinear finite element method. Governing equations are then solved by
   an elastic-predictor plastic-corrector return map procedure along with
   the Newton-Raphson and Riks techniques to trace nonlinear equilibrium
   path. A tunable reversible mechanical metamaterial unit with bi-stable
   memory operations is printed and tested experimentally and numerically.
   By a combination of cold and hot programming, the unit shows potential
   applications in mimicking electronic memory devices like tactile
   displays and designing surface adaptive structures. Another design of
   the unit shows potentials to serve in designing self-deployable
   bio-medical stents. Experiments are also conducted to demonstrate
   potential applications of cold programming for introducing recoverable
   rolling-up chiral metamaterials and load-resistance supportive auxetics.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical behaviour of chiral materials is of interest for the
   investigation of carbon nanotubes, honeycomb structures, auxetic
   materials and bones. This paper is concerned with a theory of chiral
   Cosserat elastic plates. In this theory, in contrast with the case of
   achiral plates, the stretching and flexure cannot be treated
   independently of each other. First, we derive the basic equations which
   characterize the deformation of chiral plates. Then we establish a
   uniqueness result in the dynamical theory. In the equilibrium theory we
   establish conditions under which the Neumann problem admits solutions.
   Finally, the deformation of an infinite plate with a circular hole is
   studied. It is shown that, in contrast with the theory of Cosserat
   achiral plates a uniform pressure acting on the boundary of the hole
   produces a microrotation of the material particles.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to present the results of experimental
   investigations concerning a mechanical response of 2D regular cellular
   structures with different topologies in an aspect of crashworthiness
   behaviour. Developed by the authors, genuine topologies of 2D regular
   cellular structures were built with using Fused Deposition Modelling
   (FDM) additive manufacturing method and afterwards they were subjected
   to uniaxial compression tests. A wide range of structure topologies made
   from three commercially available polymeric materials -ABSplus, Nylon12
   and PC-10 were examined during carried out investigations. One of the
   commercially available CAD systems was used to define proposed structure
   topologies. It was found that the energy absorption depends on the
   elasticity of a structure, where high strength geometries represent
   linear crashworthiness behaviour with bending and cracking while
   flexible ones present exponential increase of deformation force due to
   densification of the structure.}},

Title = {{Anomalous elastic response of a 3D anti - tetrachiral metamaterial}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{192}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{The elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of a 3D anti-tetrachiral (3ATC)
   metamaterial design was investigated using an exact analytical model,
   finite element simulations and experiments on additively manufactured
   Ti6Al4V lattices. The 3ATC structure was found to undergo a unique
   symmetric-to-asymmetric transition as the number of unit cells in the
   lattice decreases, an observation that has not been reported to date. A
   reduced lattice size also increases the influence of shear forces
   introduced by the fixed boundary conditions, which can lead to a higher
   elastic modulus in certain orientations and reduce it in others. These
   shear forces also drive the joints in small lattices into an
   out-of-plane rotation that causes the Poisson's ratio of such structures
   to range from -1.2 to 1 for different relative densities, in contrast to
   a constant value of -0.5 for bulk 3ATC lattices that do not undergo this
   joint twisting. Our results strongly indicate that the 3ATC structure
   belongs to a new `rotation-dominated' geometric class in the Ashby
   framework for cellular materials, in addition to the well-established
   bending- and stretch- dominated topologies. The main contributor of
   strain for this class of materials is rigid joint rotation, with novel,
   distinctive traits such as a nonlinear elastic stress-strain response
   and multiple relative modulus vs. relative density relationships. For
   the 3ATC structure, one of these relations is linear, similar to
   stretch-dominated structures, while the other is disjointed and does not
   follow the power law, which is atypical of a cellular material.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon (Si) electrodes possess a theoretical specific capacity nearly
   ten times that of current graphite electrodes used in lithium ion
   batteries. However, lithiation and delithiation induce large volume
   changes within the Si, resulting in cracking and eventual capacity loss
   with cycling. Recent experimental evidence indicates that the presence
   of nanoporosity may mitigate capacity fade. By implementing a scalable
   differential effective medium approach, we elucidate the effects of
   nanoporosity upon the mechanical properties of fully-lithiated
   amorpohous Si anode films. Our analytical findings suggest that
   increased pore volume fraction significantly alters the mechanical
   properties of nanofilms and enhances anode survivability. Meanwhile, the
   auxetic limit imposes an upper bound on porosity specific fracture
   toughening. Overall, the results of this paper provide design guidelines
   for multilayered nanoporous Si thin films with increased capacity
   retention.}},

Title = {{HIV infection modifies the relationship between distance to a health
   facility and treatment success rate for tuberculosis in rural eastern
   Uganda}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL TUBERCULOSIS AND OTHER MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Rationale: Distance from residence to a health facility especially in
   rural areas presents a physical barrier and may influence tuberculosis
   (TB) treatment outcomes.
   Objectives: We examined the association between distance from residence
   to a health facility and TB treatment outcomes namely treatment success
   rate (TSR) and mortality, and whether HIV influences this relationship
   among people with TB in Kumi district in rural eastern Uganda.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional design, we abstracted data from TB unit
   registers across four large health facilities. Travel of >= 5 km to a
   health facility was considered a long distance. The primary outcome was
   TSR and the secondary was mortality. We performed a generalized linear
   model with Poisson distribution with a log-link and robust standard
   errors to determine the association between distance and the study
   outcomes adjusting for potential confounders. We report the adjusted
   risk ratio (aRR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI).
   Measurement and results: Of 611 participants studied, 484 (79.2\%) were
   successfully treated, 18 (2.9\%) died, and 359 (58.7\%) travelled a long
   distance to access TB treatment. Long-distance was significantly
   associated with lower TSR (aRR, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.89-0.96). Further
   analysis showed that longer distance was associated with lower TSR among
   HIV positive persons with TB (aRR, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.72-0.96), but not
   among HIV negative persons with TB (aRR, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.03).
   Although it was not significant, longer distance showed a tendency
   towards worse mortality among HIV positive people with TB (aRR, 2.78;
   95\% CI, 0.80-9.66), but not among HIV negative people with HIV (aRR,
   0.21; 0.03-1.74).
   Conclusions: A majority of people with TB travel long distances to
   access treatment. Long distances are associated with lower TSR and
   higher mortality and affect people with TB who are HIV positive but not
   HIV negative. Interventions should focus on improving access to
   treatment for people with TB who travel long distances.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity and smoking are independently associated with a higher mortality
   risk, but previous studies have reported conflicting results about the
   relationship between these 2 time-varying exposures. Using prospective
   longitudinal data (1987-2007) from the Atherosclerosis Risk in
   Communities Study, our objective in the present study was to estimate
   the joint effects of obesity and smoking on all-cause mortality and
   investigate whether there were additive or multiplicative interactions.
   We fit a joint marginal structural Poisson model to account for
   time-varying confounding affected by prior exposure to obesity and
   smoking. The incidence rate ratios from the joint model were 2.00 (95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 1.79, 2.24) for the effect of smoking on
   mortality among nonobese persons, 1.31 (95\% CI: 1.13, 1.51) for the
   effect of obesity on mortality among nonsmokers, and 1.97 (95\% CI:
   1.73, 2.22) for the joint effect of smoking and obesity on mortality.
   The negative product term from the exponential model revealed a
   submultiplicative interaction between obesity and smoking (beta = -0.28,
   95\% CI: -0.45, -0.11; P < 0.001). The relative excess risk of
   interaction was -0.34 (95\% CI: -0.60, -0.07), indicating the presence
   of subadditive interaction. These results provide important information
   for epidemiologists, clinicians, and public health practitioners about
   the harmful impact of smoking and obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Background. A hepatitis C (HCV) cure is associated with changes in
   lipids and inflammatory biomarkers, but its impact on clinical endpoints
   among treated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfected persons
   is unclear.
   Methods. People living with HIV from EuroSIDA with a known HCV status
   after January 2001 were classified into strata based on time-updated HCV
   RNA measurements and HCV treatment, as either HCV antibody-negative;
   spontaneously resolved HCV; chronic, untreated HCV; cured HCV (HCV
   RNA-negative); or HCV treatment failures (HCV RNA-positive). Poisson
   regression was used to compare incidence rates between HCV groups for
   end-stage liver disease (ESLD; including hepatocellular carcinoma
   {[}HCC]), non-acquired immunodeficiency virus defining malignancy (NADM;
   excluding HCC), and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   Results. There were 16 618 persons included (median follow-up 8.3 years,
   interquartile range 3.1-13.7). There were 887 CVD, 902 NADM, and 436
   ESLD events; crude incidence rates/1000 person-years follow-up were 6.4
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 6.06.9) for CVD, 6.5 (95\% CI 6.1-6.9)
   for NADM, and 3.1 (95\% CI 2.8-3.4) for ESLD. After adjustment, there
   were no differences in incidence rates of NADM or CVD across the 5
   groups. HCV-negative individuals (adjusted incidence rate ratio {[}aIRR]
   0.22, 95\% CI 0.14-0.34) and those with spontaneous clearance (aIRR
   0.61, 95\% CI 0.36-1.02) had reduced rates of ESLD compared to cured
   individuals. Persons with chronic, untreated HCV infections (aIRR 1.47,
   95\% CI 1.02-2.13) or treatment failure (aIRR 1.80, 95\% CI 1.22-2.66)
   had significantly raised rates of ESLD, compared to those who were
   cured.
   Conclusions. Incidences of NADM or CVD were independent of HCV group,
   whereas those cured had substantially lower incidences of ESLD,
   underlining the importance of successful HCV treatment for reducing
   ESLD.}},

Title = {{The relation between HbA1c and hypoglycemia revisited; a secondary
   analysis from an intervention trial in patients with type 1 diabetes and
   impaired awareness of hypoglycemia}},

Abstract = {{Aims: We aimed to re-assess the previously shown but recently disputed
   association between HbA1c and severe hypoglycemia.
   Methods: 52 Patients with T1D and IAH participated in an earlier
   reported randomized, crossover trial with two 16-week intervention
   periods comparing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with
   self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). In this previous study, time
   spent in normoglycemia (the primary outcome), was improved by 9.6\% (p <
   0.0001). We performed post-hoc analyses using a zero-inflated Poisson
   regression model to assess the relationship between severe hypoglycemia
   and HbA1c, glucose variability and duration of diabetes.
   Results: During SMBG use, HbA1c and the number of severe hypoglycemic
   events were negatively associated (OR : 0.20 {[}95\% CI 0.09 to 0.44]).
   During CGM use, this relationship showed an odds ratio of 0.65 (95\% CI
   0.42 to 1.01). There was no significant relationship between glucose
   variability or duration of diabetes and severe hypoglycemia.
   Conclusions: In patients with T1D and IAH, treated with standard SMBG, a
   negative association exists between HbA1c and the number of severe
   hypoglycemic events. Thus, reaching target HbA1c values still comes with
   a higher risk of severe hypoglycemia. CGM weakens this association,
   suggesting CGM enables patients to reach their target HbA1c more safely.

Abstract = {{P>Seasonal variation in the rates of infection with certain
   Gram-negative organisms has been previously examined in tertiary-care
   centres. We performed a population-based investigation to evaluate the
   seasonal variation in Escherichia coli bloodstream infection (BSI). We
   identified 461 unique patients in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1
   January 1998 to 31 December 2007, with E. coli BSI. Incidence rates (IR)
   and IR ratios were calculated using Rochester Epidemiology Project
   tools. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to examine the
   association between the IR of E. coli BSI and average temperature. The
   age- and gender-adjusted IR of E. coli BSI per 100 000 person-years was
   50.2 (95\% CI 42.9-57.5) during the warmest 4 months (June through
   September) compared with 37.1 (95\% CI 32.7-41.5) during the remainder
   of the year, resulting in a 35\% (95\% CI 12-66\%) increase in IR during
   the warmest 4 months. The average temperature was predictive of
   increasing IR of E. coli BSI (p 0.004); there was a 7\% (95\% CI 2-12\%)
   increase in the IR for each 10-degree Fahrenheit (c. 5.5 degrees C)
   increase in average temperature. To our knowledge, this is the first
   study to demonstrate seasonal variation in E. coli BSI, with a higher IR
   during the warmest 4 months than during the remainder of the year.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of fusions of the transmembrane protease, serine 2, gene
   (TMPRSS2) with the erythroblast transformation-specific-related gene
   (ERG), or TMPRSS2: ERG, in prostate cancer varies by race. However, such
   somatic aberration and its association with prognostic factors have
   neither been studied in a West African population nor been
   systematically reviewed in the context of racial differences. We used
   immunohistochemistry to assess oncoprotein encoded by the ERG gene as
   the established surrogate of ERG fusion genes among 262 prostate cancer
   biopsies from the Ghana Prostate Study (2004-2006). Poisson regression
   with robust variance estimation provided prevalence ratios and 95\%
   confidence intervals of ERG expression in relation to patient
   characteristics. We found that 47 of 262 (18\%) prostate cancers were
   ERG-positive, and being negative for ERG staining was associated with
   higher Gleason score. We further conducted a systematic review and
   meta-analysis of TMPRSS2: ERG fusions in relation to race, Gleason
   score, and tumor stage, combining results from Ghana with 40 additional
   studies. Meta-analysis showed the prevalence of TMPRSS2: ERG fusions in
   prostate cancer to be highest in men of European descent (49\%),
   followed by men of Asian (27\%) and then African (25\%) descent. The
   lower prevalence of TMPRSS2: ERG fusions in men of African descent
   implies that alternative genomic mechanisms might explain the
   disproportionately high prostate cancer burden in such populations.}},

Abstract = {{Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) is a type of network that permanent
   connections between nodes are not always available. Routing in DTN uses
   store-carry-and-forward scheme, where nodes store and carry data until a
   suitable message carrier appears. Positive social characteristics such
   as centrality and friendship can be used to make a better routing
   decision in DTN. However, negative social characteristics such as
   selfishness may decrease the network performance. Selfish nodes for
   their individual or social benefits, do not contribute in message
   relaying when the device resources like battery level are low. Moreover,
   to achieve a better network performance we need to consider buffer
   congestion at the rely node. In this paper, we propose Congestion Aware
   and Selfishness Aware Social Routing protocol (CASASR) which by using
   social characteristics and awareness of buffer congestion and selfish
   behavior in the network selects a better relay. Using Poisson process,
   we find a utility value to select a relay node with a higher chance to
   deliver the message to the destination in the remained message TTL. In
   addition, we take into account the social and individual selfish
   behavior of nodes to adjust energy level available for message relaying.
   Comparison of our algorithm against several well-known algorithm shows
   that CASASR performs better in terms of delivery ratio and delivery
   overhead.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed at determining the role of proximity to specific types
   of green spaces (GSes) as well as their spatial location in the
   relationship with the most morbid cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and
   diabetes. We measured the accessibility to various types of GS and used
   a cross-sectional approach at census Dissemination Area (DA) levels in
   the Montreal and Quebec City metropolitan zones for the period
   2006-2011. Poisson and negative binomial regression models were fitted
   to quantify the relationship between distances to specific types of GS
   and CVD morbidity as well as some risk factors (diabetes and
   hypertension) while controlling for several social and environmental
   confounders. GSes that have sports facilities showed a significant
   relationship to cerebrovascular diseases: the most distant population
   had an 11\% higher prevalence rate ratio (PRR) compared to the nearest,
   as well as higher diabetes risk (PRR 9\%) than the nearest. However, the
   overall model performance and the understanding of the role of GSes with
   sport facilities may be substantially achieved with lifestyle factors.
   Significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and cerebrovascular diseases
   as well as lower access to GSes equipped with sports facilities were
   found in suburban areas. GSes can advantageously be used to prevent some
   CVDs and their risk factors, but there may be a need to reconsider their
   types and location.}},

Abstract = {{We revisit the universal behavior of crystalline membranes at and below
   the crumpling transition, which pertains to the mechanical properties of
   important soft and hard matter materials, such as the cytoskeleton of
   red blood cells or graphene. Specifically, we perform large-scale Monte
   Carlo simulations of a triangulated two-dimensional phantom network
   which is freely fluctuating in three-dimensional space. We obtain a
   continuous crumpling transition characterized by critical exponents
   which we estimate accurately through the use of finite-size techniques.
   By controlling the scaling corrections, we additionally compute with
   high accuracy the asymptotic value of the Poisson ratio in the flat
   phase, thus characterizing the auxetic properties of this class of
   systems. We obtain agreement with the value which is universally
   expected for polymerized membranes with a fixed connectivity.}},

   progress curve data of three chemical disease control treatments carried
   out in Rio Grande do Sul, were used in the study. Analysis of variance
   was performed to verify whether the severity of the disease differed
   between treatments. The spread of disease was was also found to be
   different between treatments and assessments, using the variance/mean
   ratio and Morisita index. The spatial distribution of the disease among
   the treatments and during the evaluations is important for the choice of
   the equation used to calculate the sample size. The spatial distribution
   of the disease was not the same across the experiments, and it varied
   between treatments and evaluations. Thus, we decided to use a formula
   that was not associated with distributions to indicate the spatial
   distribution (negative binomial or Poisson) of the disease in the field.
   The sample size to estimate the average of rice leaf blast severity
   varied between treatments and evaluations. The area under the disease
   progress curve is necessary to be determined to reduce the number of
   samples needed. Thus, it is recommended to assess 293 sheets to estimate
   severity, and 63 to estimate AUDPC at 20\% error.}},

Title = {{Benzodiazepine use as an independent risk factor for HIV infection in a
   Canadian setting}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although the harms of prescription drug diversion are of
   growing international concern, the potential impact of prescription drug
   use on HIV infection has not been well assessed. We evaluated whether
   benzodiazepine use was associated with HIV seroconversion among a cohort
   of persons who inject drugs (PWID) in a Canadian setting.
   Methods: Between May, 1996 and November, 2013, data were derived through
   a prospective cohort study of PWID in Vancouver, Canada. A total of 1682
   baseline HIV negative participants were followed for a median of 79.5
   months (interquartile range: 32.1-119.1), among whom 501 (29.8\%)
   reported benzodiazepine use at baseline, and 176 seroconverted during
   follow-up, equal to an incidence density of 1.5 (95\% Confidence
   Interval {[}CI]: 1.3-1.7) cases per 100 person-years. Poisson regression
   with time-dependent variables was used to assess whether benzodiazepine
   use was associated with the time to HIV seroconversion.
   Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, benzodiazepine use
   (Adjusted Rate Ratio: 1.50; 95\% CI: 1.01-2.24) was independently
   associated with a higher rate of HIV seroconversion.
   Conclusions: Benzodiazepine use was an independent risk factor for HIV
   seroconversion among PWID in this setting. Greater recognition of the
   safety concerns related to benzodiazepine medications including
   diversion are needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objectives: Quantitative data mining methods can be used to identify
   potential signals of unexpected relationships between drug and adverse
   event (AE). This study aims to compare and explore the use of three data
   mining methods in our small spontaneous AE database.
   Methods: We consider reporting odds ratio (ROR), Bayesian Confidence
   Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) and Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS)
   assuming two different sets of criteria: (1) ROR-1.96SE>1, IC-1.96SD>0,
   EB05>1 (2) ROR-1.96SE>2, IC-1.96SD>1, EB05>2. Count of drug-AE pairs 3
   was considered for ROR and GPS.
   Results: The Health Sciences Authority, Singapore received 151,180 AE
   reports between 1993 and 2013. ROR, BCPNN and GPS identified 2,835,
   2,311 and 2,374 significant drug-AE pairs using Criterion 1, and 1,899,
   1,101 and 1,358 respectively using Criterion 2. The performance of the
   three methods with respect to specificity, positive predictive value and
   negative predictive value were similar, although ROR yielded a higher
   sensitivity and larger area under the receiver operating characteristic
   curve. ROR and GPS picked up some potential signals which BCPNN missed.
   Conclusions: The defined threshold used for ROR (Criterion 1) is a
   useful screening tool for our small database. It may be used in
   conjunction with GPS to avoid missed signals.}},

Pages = {{699-709}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although various hybrid 3D carbon-based architectures are reported by
   covalently connecting low dimensional carbon allotropes, the effect of
   junction configuration on deformation and mechanical properties of the
   hybrid carbon architectures remain elusive. Here, we focus on Pillared
   Graphene Nanostructure (PGN) as a model system with symmetric and
   asymmetric junctions to explore its diverse elastic and inelastic
   properties via first-principles and molecular dynamics simulations. By
   introducing heptagonal and octagonal rings in the junctions, our
   findings demonstrate that in contrast to the stacked of graphene sheets,
   which exhibit weak out-of-plane properties, both junction types impart a
   cooperative two-regime deformation mechanism that provides a number of
   superior characteristics in PGN, including 3D balance of strength and
   toughness as well as an outstanding similar to 42\% out-of-plane
   ductility preceding the failure. Furthermore, asymmetric junctions
   impose wrinkles in the PGN sheets, which add extra in-plane flexibility
   and shear compliance, result in a nearly zero/negative in-plane
   Poisson's ratio in PGN, and cause the octagonal rings to act as hotspot
   for initiating of fracture. Our results provide the first atomistic
   ``lens{''} on fundamental understanding of junction-induced deformation
   mechanisms in pillared graphene and can potentially provide a new phase
   space to better control and design mechano-mutable hybrid carbon
   nanostructures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Study Objective: Pregnant and nonpregnant populations in the United
   States report marijuana as the most commonly used illicit drug. Patterns
   of marijuana use and psychosocial correlates are unclear among
   non-treatment-seeking teenage girls.
   Design, Setting, Participants, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measures:
   The objective of this study was to use cross-sectional data to examine
   the psychosocial correlates of recent marijuana use among a sample of
   646 pregnant and nonpregnant adolescent girls presenting to urban
   primary care clinics (mean age = 15.6 years, SD = 1.9 years; 65\%
   African American; 8.8\% pregnant).
   Results: In Poisson regression analysis, frequency of marijuana use was
   significantly associated with greater likelihood of pregnancy (incident
   rate ratio {[}IRR], 1.30; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.65), alcohol use (IRR, 1.11;
   95\% CI, 10.08-1.14), condomless sex (IRR, 1.95; 95\% CI, 1.61-2.37),
   parents' drug use (IRR, 1.04; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.05), and negative peer
   influences (IRR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.16).
   Conclusion: Marijuana use among adolescent girls in this sample was
   associated with a number of risk behaviors as well as parental and peer
   influences. Culturally sensitive screening and intervention approaches
   for marijuana use among adolescent girls should address multiple
   individual, relationship, and community factors, to prevent unwanted
   pregnancy as well as to reduce marijuana use during this vulnerable
   time.}},

Abstract = {{We determined whether rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic
   citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) can predict remission or severe
   disability in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with anti-tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF) alpha drugs. We performed a cohort study based on
   the clinical data from a referral center for the treatment of RA in
   Bogota, Colombia, were included patients aged >= 18 years with diagnosis
   of RA with an active disease and for whom a treatment scheme was begun
   with anti-TNF alpha medication, with a minimum follow-up time of 12
   months. Disease activity of Rheumatoid Arthritis was assessed through
   measurement of RF, ACPA, disease activity score (DAS28), and health
   assessment questionnaire (HAQ). We calculated the incidence rates (IRs)
   for remission and severe disability. We also calculated the incidence
   rate ratio (IRR) for each outcome by adjusting for possible confounders
   using the Poisson regression method. The hypothesis was tested with a P
   value of <.05. Statistical analysis was performed in Stata 15. We
   included 400 patients receiving an anti-TNF alpha agent. Median age was
   60 years, and 322 patients were women (80.5\%). RF was positive in 357
   patients (89\%), ACPA in 348 patients (87\%), and co-positivity in 324
   patients (81\%). Median follow-up was 41 months (range, 12-79 months).
   The IR for remission was 23 per 100 person-years in RF-negative patients
   and 16 per 100 person-years in RF-positive patients. The adjusted IRR
   (age sex, treatment, and ACPA) was 1.51 (95\%CI, 1.05-2.18). The IR for
   severe disability was 10.8 per 100 person-years in the RF-positive
   cohort and 2.3 per 100 person-years in the RF-negative cohort. The IRR
   adjusted for these factors was 4.37 (95\%CI, 1.6-12). Co-positivity had
   a similar behavior to RF. No differences were recorded in the rates of
   remission or disability in ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative patients. Our
   findings suggest that remission is less frequent and severe disability
   more frequent in RF-positive patients treated with anti-TNF alpha agents
   than in RF-negative patients.}},

   Laminated Ribbons of Flexible Electronics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Laminated ribbons have been widely adopted for structures of flexible
   electronics to simultaneously achieve the electronic functions and
   mechanical performances. Their effective tensile stiffness and bending
   stiffness, which are extensively used as fundamental parameters in the
   mechanical analysis, are usually obtained by the plane-strain hypothesis
   for simplicity. However, it is found that the practical condition is
   usually closer to the traction free, even for the cases with a
   relatively large width. Here, a traction-free model is proposed to
   analytically obtain the effective tensile stiffness and bending
   stiffness of laminated ribbons, which can be used directly in the
   mechanical analysis of flexible electronics. The prediction of the
   traction-free model agrees very well with the precise result obtained by
   3D finite element analysis (FEA) for the cases that are in the range of
   structure designs of flexible electronics. It is found that the
   tensile/bending stiffness of traction-free model is between the
   plane-stress model and plane-strain model, but is closer to the
   plane-stress model. The use of the plane-strain model sometimes may
   yield a considerable error in the mechanical analysis of flexible
   electronics. The parameter study shows that this model is very important
   for the problems with advanced materials, such as metamaterials with
   negative Poisson's ratio. This work provides a theoretical basis for the
   mechanical analysis of flexible electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Physicians' negative attitudes toward patients with obesity
   are well documented. Whether or how these beliefs may affect
   patient-physician communication is unknown. To describe the relationship
   between patient body mass index (BMI) and physician communication
   behaviors (biomedical, psychosocial/ lifestyle, and rapport building)
   during typical outpatient primary care visits was aimed.
   Design and Methods: Using audio-recorded outpatient encounters from 39
   urban primary care physicians (PCPs) and 208 of their patients, the
   frequency of communication behaviors using the Roter Interaction
   Analysis System was examined. The independent variable was measured;
   patient BMI and dependent variables were communication behaviors by the
   PCP within the biomedical, psychosocial/lifestyle, and rapport building
   domains. A cross-sectional analysis using multilevel Poisson regression
   models to evaluate the association between BMI and physician
   communication was performed.
   Results: PCPs demonstrated less emotional rapport with overweight and
   obese patients (incidence rate ratio, IRR, 0.65, 95\% CI 0.48-0.88, P =
   0.01; IRR 0.69, 95\% CI 0.58-0.82, P < 0.01, respectively) than for
   normal weight patients. No differences in PCPs' biomedical or
   psychosocial/lifestyle communication by patient BMI were found.
   Conclusions: Our findings raise the concern that low levels of emotional
   rapport in primary care visits with overweight and obese patients may
   weaken the patient-physician relationship, diminish patients' adherence
   to recommendations, and decrease the effectiveness of behavior change
   counseling.}},

Abstract = {{Small-scale soft-bodied machines that respond to externally applied
   magnetic field have attracted wide research interest because of their
   unique capabilities and promising potential in a variety of fields,
   especially for biomedical applications. When the size of such machines
   approach the sub-millimeter scale, their designs and functionalities are
   severely constrained by the available fabrication methods, which only
   work with limited materials, geometries, and magnetization profiles. To
   free such constraints, here, we propose a bottom-up assembly-based 3D
   microfabri-cation approach to create complex 3D miniature wireless
   magnetic soft machines at the milli-and sub-millimeter scale with
   arbitrary multimaterial compositions, arbitrary 3D geometries, and
   arbitrary programmable 3D magne-tization profiles at high spatial
   resolution. This approach helps us concurrently realize diverse
   characteristics on the machines, including programmable shape morphing,
   negative Poisson's ratio, complex stiffness distribution, directional
   joint bending, and remagnetization for shape reconfiguration. It
   enlarges the design space and en-ables biomedical device-related
   functionalities that are previously difficult to achieve, including
   peristaltic pump -ing of biological fluids and transport of solid
   objects, active targeted cargo transport and delivery, liquid biopsy,
   and reversible surface anchoring in tortuous tubular environments
   withstanding fluid flows, all at the sub-millimeter scale. This work
   improves the achievable complexity of 3D magnetic soft machines and
   boosts their future capa-bilities for applications in robotics and
   biomedical engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Research on intergenerational social mobility and health-related
   behaviours yields mixed findings. Depending on the direction of mobility
   and the type of mechanisms involved, we can expect positive or negative
   association between intergenerational mobility and health-related
   behaviours. Using data from a retrospective cohort study, conducted in
   more than 100 towns across Belarus, Hungary and Russia, we fit
   multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regressions with two measures of
   health-related behaviours: binge drinking and smoking. The main
   explanatory variable, intergenerational educational mobility is
   operationalised in terms of relative intergenerational educational
   trajectories based on the prevalence of specified qualifications in
   parental and offspring generations. In each country the associations
   between intergenerational educational mobility, binge drinking and
   smoking was examined with incidence rate ratios and predicted
   probabilities, using multiply imputed dataset for missing data and
   controlling for important confounders of health-related behaviours. We
   find that intergenerational mobility in relative educational attainment
   has varying association with binge drinking and smoking and the strength
   and direction of these effects depend on the country of analysis, the
   mode of mobility, the gender of respondents and the type of
   health-related behaviour. Along with accumulation and Falling from Grace
   hypotheses of the consequences of intergenerational mobility, our
   findings suggest that upward educational mobility in certain instances
   might be linked to improved health-related behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To compare daily exposure to tuberculosis (TB) patients
   between HIV-infected and non-HIVinfected health care workers (HCWs), and
   examine the uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and isoniazid
   preventive therapy (IPT) among HIV-infected HCWs in Botswana.
   DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study among HCWs in 30 hospitals
   and clinics. We determined self-reported exposure frequency to TB
   patients and HIV status through in-person interviews. HCWs with unknown
   or negative HIV status were offered rapid HIV testing. Multivariable
   Poisson regression modeling with robust variance was used to estimate
   the association between HIV status and daily exposure to TB patients.
   RESULTS: Of 1877 participants enrolled, 1388 (73.9\%) with complete data
   were included in this study. Among 277 (20.0\%) HIV-infected
   participants, 14.3\% were newly diagnosed, 57.8\% were on ART, and
   34.3\% reported previously receiving IPT. Daily exposure to TB patients
   was reported by respectively 48.4\% and 52.9\% of HIV-infected and
   non-infected participants. After adjusting for sex, age, occupation, and
   department, the rates of daily TB exposure remained similar between
   HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected participants (prevalence ratio 0.96,
   95\%CI 0.85-1.08).
   CONCLUSIONS: We found similar rates of exposure to TB patients between
   HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected HCWs. Improved efforts are needed to
   reduce nosocomial exposure to TB among HIV-infected HCWs.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of silicon on insulator (SOI) and grooved gate help to
   lessen the short channel effects (SCEs). Again the work function
   modulation along the metal gate gives a better drain current due to the
   uniform electric field along the channel. So all these concepts are
   combined and used in the proposed MOSFET structure for more improved
   performance. In this work, trapezoidal recessed channel silicon on
   insulator (TRC-SOI) MOSFET and work function modulated trapezoidal
   recessed channel silicon on insulator (WFM-TRC-SOI) MOSFET are compared
   with DC and RF parameters and later linearity of both the devices is
   tested. An analytical model is formulated by using a 2-D Poisson's
   equation and develops a compact equation for threshold voltage using
   minimum surface potential. In this work we analyze the effect of
   negative junction depth and the corner angle on various device
   parameters such as minimum surface potential, sub-threshold slope (SS),
   drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) and threshold voltage. The
   analysis interprets that the switching performance of WFM-TRC-SOI MOSFET
   surpasses TRC-SOI MOSFET in terms of high I-on/I-off ratio and also the
   proposed structure can minimize the short channel effects (SCEs) in RF
   application. The validity of proposed model has been verified with
   simulation result performed on Sentaurus TCAD device simulator. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{By combining rotating squares with auxetic properties, we developed a
   metamaterial transformer capable of realizing metamaterials with tunable
   functionalities. We investigated the use of a metamaterial
   transformer-based thermal cloak-concentrator that can change from a
   cloak to a concentrator when the device configuration is transformed. We
   established that the proposed dual-functional metamaterial can either
   thermally protect a region (cloak) or focus heat flux in a small region
   (concentrator). The dual functionality was verified by finite element
   simulations and validated by experiments with a specimen composed of
   copper, epoxy, and rotating squares. This work provides an effective and
   efficient method for controlling the gradient of heat, in addition to
   providing a reference for other thermal metamaterials to possess such
   controllable functionalities by adapting the concept of a metamaterial
   transformer.}},

Title = {{Influence of pore shape on impact dynamics characteristics of
   functionally graded brittle materials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRAIN ANALYSIS FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN}},
Abstract = {{Improving the impact energy dissipation capacity of functionally graded
   brittle materials through pore design will help avoid or delay failure.
   In order to improve the impact energy dissipation capacity of
   functionally graded brittle materials, pores with specific shapes can be
   implanted inside them. The effect of pore shape on the impact properties
   of functionally graded brittle materials was investigated using a
   lattice-spring model that can quantitatively represent the mechanical
   properties of functionally graded brittle materials. The calculated
   results show that the pores with negative Poisson's ratio such as
   inner-concave triangle, fourth-order star, and inner-concave hexagon are
   easy to collapse under the impact, while the square and square-hexagon
   pores have the strongest resistance to deformation. For all seven pore
   shapes, the Hugoniot elastic limit of the samples decreased gradually
   with increasing porosity, and the Hugoniot elastic limit did not change
   with the change of piston velocity. The propagation velocity of the
   deformation wave increases with the piston velocity and the velocity of
   the particle corresponding to the Hugoniot state behind the deformation
   wave increases accordingly. The principle that pores can enhance the
   macroscopic impact energy dissipation capacity of functionally graded
   brittle material samples revealed in this paper will contribute to the
   prevention of sample impact failure and provide guidance for the optimal
   design of impact kinetic properties of samples.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study examines the relationship between economic
   adversity transitions from childhood to older adulthood and older
   adulthood physical performance among 1,998 community-dwelling older
   adults from five demographically diverse sites from middle and
   high-income countries. Method: The principal exposure variable was
   economic adversity transition. No adversity encompassed not experiencing
   poverty in both childhood and older adulthood, improved described having
   only experienced poverty in childhood, worsened captured having
   experienced poverty in older adulthood, and severe is having experienced
   poverty in both childhood and older adulthood. The short physical
   performance battery (SPPB) was used for outcome measures. Analyses of
   the continuous SPPB score used linear regression, while analysis of a
   binary outcome (SPPB < 8 vs. >= 8) used Poisson regression models with
   robust error variance, both adjusting for sex, education, and site
   location. Result: In sex-stratified models, the SPPB < 8 prevalence rate
   ratio (PRR) was higher for the severe (PRR: 2.80, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = {[}1.70, 4.61]), worsened (PRR: 2.40, 95\% CI =
   {[}1.41, 4.09]), and improved (PRR: 1.82, 95\% CI = {[}1.11, 3.01])
   groups, compared with those with no adversity in childhood or as adults,
   but only for females. Discussion: Findings from this study indicate that
   persistent economic adversity has a negative effect on older adult
   physical performance, especially among women.}},

Title = {{Spatial Effects on Zone-Level Collision Prediction Models}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2398}},
Pages = {{50-59}},
Abstract = {{A recent study developed a set of zone-level negative binomial collision
   prediction models to investigate the relationship between various
   transportation and sociodemographic characteristics and overall roadway
   safety. The developed models used data from Metro Vancouver, British
   Columbia, Canada, and considered the effect of Poisson variations and
   heterogeneity (extra variation) on collision occurrence. This study aims
   to evaluate spatial effects on the occurrence of collisions and to check
   whether the inclusion of spatial variables can improve the goodness of
   fit and inference capability of those previously developed prediction
   models. Transit-reliant and application-based collision prediction
   models with spatial correlations were developed by using the WinBUGS
   software. The convergence of the developed models was tested by trace
   plots of the parameter estimated, the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistics,
   and ratios of Monte Carlo errors relative to the standard deviations of
   the estimates. The results showed that incorporation of the spatial
   correlations affected the parameter estimates, the values of dispersion
   parameters and intercepts, and also the t-statistics. The effect of the
   main exposure variable on all of the models for total, severe, and
   property-damage-only collisions was found to be smaller under spatial
   models. The smaller values of the exponents of the main exposure
   variable confirmed the assumption that spatial effects need to be
   considered in collision prediction models to mitigate any potential bias
   associated with model misspecification.}},

Abstract = {{Macro-architectured cellular (MAC) material is defined as a class of
   engineered materials having configurable cells of relatively large
   (i.e., visible) size that can be architecturally designed to achieve
   various desired material properties. Two types of novel MAC materials,
   negative Poisson's ratio material and biomimetic tendon reinforced
   material, were introduced in this study. To estimate the effective
   material properties for structural analyses and to optimally design such
   materials, a set of suitable homogenization methods was developed that
   provided an effective means for the multiscale modeling of MAC
   materials. First, a strain-based homogenization method was developed
   using an approach that separated the strain field into a homogenized
   strain field and a strain variation field in the local cellular domain
   superposed on the homogenized strain field. The principle of virtual
   displacements for the relationship between the strain variation field
   and the homogenized strain field was then used to condense the strain
   variation field onto the homogenized strain field. The new method was
   then extended to a stress-based homogenization process based on the
   principle of virtual forces and further applied to address the discrete
   systems represented by the beam or frame structures of the
   aforementioned MAC materials. The characteristic modes and the stress
   recovery process used to predict the stress distribution inside the
   cellular domain and thus determine the material strengths and failures
   at the local level are also discussed.}},

Title = {{Tuning the electronic and magnetic properties of pentagraphene through
   the C1 vacancy}},
Journal = {{2D MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Pentagraphene (PG), a two-dimensional allotrope of carbon with only
   five-membered rings, was recently predicted to exhibit a wide band gap,
   an unusual negative Poisson's ratio, and robust dynamical and thermal
   stability. However, its potential properties arising from defect
   engineering of five-membered rings have not been explored yet. In this
   work, we explore the C1 vacancy in PG using first-principles density
   functional calculations. The formation energy of this vacancy is
   surprisingly within the formation energy window of monovacancy (MV) in
   graphene. This defect introduces eight midgap levels indicating the
   possibility of studying the charge states. The charged defect is
   amphoteric with deep donor and deep acceptor levels. Introducing the
   vacancy in the sheet renders it inherently ferromagnetic (FM) with a
   magnetic moment of 4 mu(B). Upon further investigating spin polarization
   in PG, three possible unique magnetic configurations are found to exist:
   FM, ferrimagnetic (FiM), and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM). The energy
   difference between the FM and the FiM (AFM) states is similar to-62.4
   meV atom(-1)(similar to-81.9 meV atom(-1)). Despite FiM and AFM being
   lower in energy, interestingly, this intrinsic FM ordering of spins is
   preserved even when the defect concentration is increased. This
   observation would probably hint at the existence of a kinetic barrier
   between FM and AFM states which merits further investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To identify the frequency of perception and expectations to work in
   the area of primary health care(PHC) as well as their associated factors
   with personnel at five health facilities.
   Method: Cross-sectional study on five health facilities of PHC.
   Perception and expectations to work in PHC were measured, and their
   association with social-work variables was investigated. Simple and
   multiple regression analysis was performed to estimate prevalence ratios
   (PR), using the Poisson family, robust variance and having a health
   facility as a cluster.
   Results: Out of 94 participants, 64.9\% did not have an adequate
   perceptionabout working in the area of PHC. The 60.6\% had an
   expectation to work in PHC 10 years from now. A positive association was
   found between female gender and perception about working in the area of
   PHC (PR = 3.24). There was a negative association between being divorced
   and/or widowed and the expectation to work in PHC (PR: 0.51).
   Conclusions: Perception about working in PHC is low, but more than half
   of the sample expect to work in PHC10 years from now. Being a woman
   increases the prevalence job perception in PHC. Working time over 5
   years was positively associated with having expectations to work in PHC.
   On the contrary, divorced/widowed marital status was negatively
   associated.}},

Abstract = {{In many countries, specialist cancer services are centralised to improve
   outcomes. We explored how centralisation affects the radical treatment
   of high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer in the English NHS.
   79,085 patients diagnosed with high-risk and locally advanced prostate
   cancer in England (April 2014 to March 2016) were identified in the
   National Prostate Cancer Audit database. Poisson models were used to
   estimate risk ratios (RR) for undergoing radical treatment by whether
   men were diagnosed at a regional co-ordinating centre ('hub'), for
   having surgery by the presence of surgical services on-site, and for
   receiving high dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) in addition to external
   beam radiotherapy by its regional availability. Men were equally likely
   to receive radical treatment, irrespective of whether they were
   diagnosed in a hub (RR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.91-1.08). Men were more likely to
   have surgery if they were diagnosed at a hospital with surgical services
   on site (RR 1.24, 1.10-1.40), and more likely to receive additional
   HDR-BT if they were diagnosed at a hospital with direct regional access
   to this service (RR 6.16, 2.94-12.92). Centralisation of specialist
   cancer services does not affect whether men receive radical treatment,
   but it does affect treatment modality. Centralisation may have a
   negative impact on access to specific treatment modalities.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of present study was to investigate, using a disk model, the
   effects of charge density and 1-1 electrolyte properties on the diffuse
   portion of the electrical double layer near a 2:1 clay mineral particle,
   Numerical solutions for the inner potential and anion exclusion volume
   were obtained by solving a Poisson-Boltzmann equation with varying
   parameter values for electrolyte ion radius, electrolyte concentration,
   basal plane charge density, and edge surface charge density. Although
   the negative electrostatic potential of the basal planes may spill over
   to dominate a positively charged edge surface at low electrolyte
   concentrations because of the typically large particle
   radius-to-thickness ratio, the simulation results suggested that the
   spillover effect diminishes with an increase in 1-1 electrolyte
   concentration, The electric potential surrounding the edge surface is
   more positive for large (0.4 nm) hardsphere electrolyte ions than for
   small (0.2 nm) or point-charge ions, Reducing the basal plane charge
   density does not significantly affect the anion exclusion volume over a
   wide range of electrolyte concentration, A highly positive edge surface,
   however, may spill over to dominate the basal plane and thereby adsorb
   significant amounts of anions at low electrolyte concentrations. The
   disk model predictions of anion adsorption or exclusion behavior for 2:1
   clay mineral particles were consistent with available experimental
   observations. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Rotavirus is a common cause of acute gastroenteritis and has
   also been associated with generalized tonic-clonic afebrile seizures.
   Since rotavirus vaccine introduction, hospitalizations for treatment of
   acute gastroenteritis have decreased. We assess whether there has been
   an associated decrease in seizure-associated hospitalizations.
   Methods. We used discharge codes to abstract data on seizure
   hospitalizations among children < 5 years old from the State Inpatient
   Databases of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. We compared
   seizure hospitalization rates before and after vaccine introduction,
   using Poisson regression, stratifying by age and by month and year of
   admission. We performed a time-series analysis with negative binomial
   models, constructed using prevaccine data from 2000 to 2006 and
   controlling for admission month and year.
   Results. We examined 962 899 seizure hospitalizations among children < 5
   years old during 2000-2013. Seizure rates after vaccine introduction
   were lower than those before vaccine introduction by 1\%-8\%, and rate
   ratios decreased over time. Time-series analyses demonstrated a decrease
   in the number of seizure-coded hospitalizations in 2012 and 2013, with
   notable decreases in children 12-17 months and 18-23 months.
   Conclusions. Our analysis provides evidence for a decrease in seizure
   hospitalizations following rotavirus vaccine introduction in the United
   States, with the greatest impact in age groups with a high
   rotavirus-associated disease burden and during rotavirus infection
   season.}},

Title = {{Sexually transmitted infections after bereavement - a population-based
   cohort study}},
Journal = {{BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Loss of a loved one has consistently been associated with
   various health risks. Little is however known about its relation to
   sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
   Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study during 1987-2012
   using the Swedish Multi-Generation Register, including 3,002,209 women
   aged 10-44 years. Bereavement was defined as death of a child, parent,
   sibling or spouse (N = 979,579, 33 \%). STIs were defined as hospital
   visits with an STI as main or secondary diagnosis. Poisson regression
   and negative binomial regression were used to estimate incidence rate
   ratios (IRRs) and 95 \% confidence intervals (CIs) of STIs, comparing
   incidence rates of women who had experienced loss to those who had not.
   Results: Bereaved women were at significantly higher risk of nearly all
   STIs studied. The relative risk of any STI was highest during the first
   year after loss (IRR: 1.45, 95 \% CI: 1.27-1.65) and predominantly among
   women with subsequent onset of psychiatric disorders after bereavement
   (IRR: 2.61, 95 \% CI: 2.00-3.34). Notably, a consistent excess risk,
   persisting for over five years, was observed for acute salpingitis (IRR:
   1.28, 95 \% CI: 1.13-1.44), a severe complication of bacterial STIs.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that women who have experienced
   bereavement are at increased risk of STIs.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional welded-flange through-diaphragm CFST column connections
   may develop fracture failures at bottom flanges. The
   bottom-flange-bolted upper-flange-welded (BFB-UFW) connection adopts a
   bolted connection between the bottom flange and the bottom diaphragm to
   reduce the early fracture risk. However, the asymmetric connection
   design would cause different moment bearing mechanisms and then
   influence the seismic performance of the connection. In this study,
   cyclic tests were performed on two BFB-UFW connections and one
   traditional welded-flange connection to investigate detailed working
   mechanisms and the influence of the bottom bolts on seismic performances
   of the connection. The BFB-UFW displayed good deformation abilities with
   the maximum drift ratio being higher than 5\%. The bolted bottom flange
   connection could alleviate the deformation demand on beam flanges
   through relative plate sliding behaviors. Bolt slips in the bottom
   flange connection led to pinched hysteretic loops. The BFB-UFW
   connection with a strong bottom flange connection exhibited higher
   negative strengths than the positive bending strengths due to the
   Poisson effect and the asymmetric supporting effect from the bottom
   diaphragm. The BFB-UFW connection belongs to the semi-rigid
   full-strength type. Therefore, this connection can be applied to a
   moment resisting frame, but the stiffness, strength and ductility of the
   connection must be considered in structural design.}},

Abstract = {{Limited data are available on the real-world effectiveness of newer oral
   disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in multiple sclerosis. The purpose of
   this study was to retrospectively compare the real-world effectiveness
   of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), fingolimod, teriflunomide, and injectable
   DMTs in routine clinical practice based on US claims data.
   Patients newly-initiating DMF, interferon beta (IFN beta), glatiramer
   acetate (GA), teriflunomide, or fingolimod in 2013 were identified in
   the Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims Databases (N = 6372). Relapse
   episodes were identified based on a published claim-based algorithm and
   used to determine the annualized relapse rate (ARR) for the year before
   and after initiating therapy. Poisson and negative binomial regression
   was used to determine the adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) for each
   therapy relative to DMF.
   Significant ARR reductions in the year after initiating therapy were
   reported for DMF and fingolimod (P < 0.0001). Compared with DMF, the
   adjusted IRR (95\% CI) for relapse in the year after initiating therapy
   was 1.27 (1.10-1.46) for IFN beta, 1.34 (1.17-1.53) for GA, 1.23
   (1.05-1.45) for teriflunomide, and 1.03 (0.88-1.21) for fingolimod.
   Results were consistent across subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
   These real-world data suggest DMF and fingolimod have similar
   effectiveness and demonstrate superior effectiveness to IFN beta, GA,
   and teriflunomide.

Abstract = {{Very recently, a (SiH)(2)O-formed siloxene sheet has been synthesized in
   an experiment {[}S. Li, et al. J. Mater. Chem. A 2016, 4, 15841].
   Utilizing first-principles calculations, we have systematically
   investigated the structural stability and the physical properties of
   this (SiH)(2)O sheet. We have found a dynamically stable structure
   because it is a puckered one with bent Si-O-Si connections, which leads
   to an anisotropic elastic behaviour with negative Poisson ratios. The
   (SiH)(2)O sheet has a strain-tunable direct band gap whose valence and
   conduction band edges straddle the redox potentials of water even in the
   presence of stress (either tensile or compressive). The calculated
   carrier mobilities are prominently anisotropic: in its zigzag direction
   the electron mobility reaches a high value of 5.39 x 10(3) cm(2) V-1
   s(-1), while the hole mobility remains small. These different carrier
   mobilities permit fast charge separation and transfer, which is crucial
   for efficient solar-to-electric energy conversion for photovoltaic and
   water splitting applications. Similar to phosphorene, a typical linear
   dichroism phenomenon is also present in the (SiH)(2)O sheet. Due to its
   outstanding electronic properties, the (SiH)(2)O sheet is a promising
   material in the fields of nano-electronics, sustainable energy and fuel
   generation.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: The potential influence of lunar phases on the occurrence of
   myocardial infarction is still controversial. The purpose of the present
   study was to investigate the association of the lunar cycle on the
   occurrence of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction based on a
   myocardial infarction registry.
   Methods and results: We studied 15,985 patients consecutively
   hospitalised with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) between 1 January
   1985 and 31 December 2007 with a known date of symptom onset who were
   recruited from a population-based myocardial infarction registry. The
   exact hour of AMI onset was known for 9813 events. Poisson regression
   analysis was performed to examine the relation between the lunar cycle
   and the occurrence of AMI.
   There was no association between new moon, full moon, waning moon and
   waxing moon and the occurrence of AMI. However, we observed that the
   three days after a new moon may be significantly protective for the
   occurrence of AMI, rate ratio (RR) 0.94 (95\% CI 0.91-0.98), and the day
   before a new moon had a slightly negative effect (RR 1.06, 95\% CI
   1.00-1.12). Stratified analysis did not reveal any susceptible
   subgroups.
   Conclusion: The moon phases did not show any apparent association with
   AMI occurrence. However, there might be a `cardioprotective' time three
   days after a new moon.}},

Abstract = {{The resilience of materials from the notch effect together with
   subsequent operating life and safety are important factors for the
   choice of material in industrial manufacture as well as for crash
   scenarios. The aim of this investigation is to study stress caused by
   the notch effect for HCT780XD and X5CrNi18-10 at different tensile test
   strain rates as well as due to various stress concentration factors
   during a high-speed tensile test. The notch geometries chosen are round,
   trapezoid, sharp and bore. They are compared to a test specimen without
   notch. The stress distribution analysis of notches was performed by the
   finite-element-method (FEM) in order to determine stress concentration
   factors. The high-speed tensile test was recorded with a high-speed
   camera. For this purpose, the test specimens were marked with a
   speckle-pattern, essential for the identification of strain rate via
   Dantec Dynamics Istra 4D. The influence of the stress concentration rate
   on parameters like energy, strength and the elongation of break was
   established and will be reported in the following. The level of the
   concentration factor leads to negative effects while the strain rate
   level delivers positive results. On other hand, the stress concentration
   factor is more important on the parameter than the strain rate. By
   contrast, Poisson's ratio does not affect the parameters observed.}},

Abstract = {{Socioeconomic status (SES) appears to have positive and negative
   associations with sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk in
   resource-limited settings, but few studies have evaluated nationally
   representative data. We assessed multiple SES measures and their effect
   on STI risk. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Uganda
   Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS 2011). The primary outcome (STI
   risk) was self-reported STIs and/or symptoms in the prior 12 months. We
   examined associations between multiple SES measures and STI risk using a
   mixed-effects Poisson regression model. The results showed that of the
   9256 sexually active individuals, 7428 women and 1828 men were included
   in the analysis. At an individual level, middle wealth quintile and
   disposable income were associated with STI risk, whereas being in the
   richest wealth quintile was protective. Residence in wealthier regions
   (adjusted incidence rate ratio {[}aIRR] 3.92, 3.62, and 2.75, for
   Central, Western, and Eastern regions; p < 0.01) was associated with
   increased STI risk. Regional level analysis revealed stochastic
   variability of STI risk across geographical region (variance 0.03; p =
   0.01). The bilateral association between SES and STI risk underscores
   the need for multi-sectoral interventions to address the upstream
   effects of poverty on STI risk and downstream effects of STIs on health
   and economic productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the
   impact of untreated caries in different stages on the oral health
   related quality of life (OHRQoL) of one- to three-year-olds and their
   families. Methods: The mothers of 308 children answered the Brazilian
   version of the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale to determine
   their perceptions of the OHRQoL of their children. The mothers also
   answered a questionnaire addressing demographic and socioeconomic
   characteristics of their families. The children were submitted to a
   clinical examination for the diagnosis of dental caries using
   International Caries Detection and Assessment System criteria. Data
   analysis involved descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis and
   Mann-Whitney tests, and hierarchically adjusted Poisson regression
   models. Results: The prevalence of untreated caries was 643 percent.
   Among the children with caries, 53.5 percent exhibited the severe stage
   of the condition. Negative impact on OHRQoL was significantly associated
   with severe stage of caries (prevalence ratio {[}PR] equals 2.80, 95
   percent confidence interval {[}Cl] equals 1.90 to 4.12, P<0.001), and a
   younger age for the mother (PR equals 1.69, 95 percent Cl equals 1.27 to

Abstract = {{This is a territory-wide study to investigate the impact of coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on Accident and Emergency Department
   (A\&E) attendances and acute ward admissions for seizures. Adult
   patients who presented to the A\&E with seizures from January 23, 2020
   to March 24, 2020 (study period) were included and compared with
   parallel intervals from 2015 to 2019 (control periods). Preexisting time
   trend in control periods and potential changes during COVID-19 were
   analyzed by Poisson, negative and logistic regression models.
   Accident and Emergency Department attendances and ward admissions for
   seizures decreased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total
   of 319 and 230 recorded ward admissions and A\&E attendances for
   seizures were identified during the study period in 2020, compared with
   494 and 343 per annum, respectively in the control periods. The ratio of
   acute ward admission per A\&E attendance for seizures did not change
   significantly. Intensive care utility and mortality rates remained
   stable.
   For some patients, delaying medical attention due to fear of nosocomial
   COVID-19 cross-infection may lead to severe or even life-threatening
   consequences. This change in medical help-seeking behavior calls for new
   medical care models to meet the service gap. Education to patients with
   epilepsy and their caregivers is of utmost importance during this
   pandemic. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The prediction of earthquakes remains challenging. An unconventional
   idea that earthquakes can be predicted is proposed, based on the
   mechanics of the double block system (DBS). The central point of the
   mechanics of DBS lies in the measurement of the forces acting on the
   surface separating the two blocks, the relation of which should obey
   Newton's laws (referred to as Newton's forces). A Newton's force
   monitoring system (NFMS), consisting of in situ measurement, remote
   sensing and indoor monitoring, has been developed. The key instrument of
   the NFMS is the constant-resistance and large-deformation (CRLD) bolt
   incorporated with a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure, referred
   to as CRLD bolt or NPR bolt, because of its unconventional performance
   that makes measurement of the Newton's forces possible in
   seismically-active faults. The basic analytical and experimental work on
   formulating the DBS and NPR cable is outlined. The methods and
   techniques of the NFMS are presented. The validity of the mechanics of
   DBS and the applicability of the NRMS were verified by indoor
   experiments on Wenchuan and Longmen mountain active faults. Among many
   successful applications of NFMS to forecasting landslides, one field
   case in Nanfen open pit iron mines is presented; four field cases of the
   application of NFMS in registering the activities of the seismically
   active faults are also presented.}},

Title = {{Associations of spatial mobility with sexual risk behaviors among young

Abstract = {{Spatial contexts and spatial mobility are important factors of the HIV
   epidemic and sexually transmitted infections. Using global positioning
   system (GPS) devices, we examined the associations of objectively
   measured spatial mobility with sexual risk behaviors among gay, bisexual
   and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in New York City. This
   observational study included a subgroup of 253 HIV-negative MSM from the
   Project 18 Cohort Study, who participated in the GPS monitoring
   sub-study. Spatial mobility was measured as (1) distance traveled and
   (2) activity space size defined as daily path area during 2-week of GPS
   tracking. We examined the associations of these measures with numbers of
   male sexual partners and condomless anal intercourse (CAI) acts during
   last six months using quasi-Poisson models, adjusting for
   socio-demographics. Results demonstrated that spatial mobility was
   positively associated with sexual risk behaviors, for example, with CAI
   (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] = 1.01 for a 10 km increase in distance
   traveled and IRR = 1.04 for a 1 km(2) increase in 50 m-buffer activity
   space size). Our findings may enhance the understanding of spatial
   contexts of HIV risk. Future studies should be conducted to examine the
   mechanisms for the associations between spatial mobility behaviors with
   sexual risk behaviors as well as the influence of neighborhood
   characteristics in various neighborhood contexts, which may guide the
   place-based HIV prevention services.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors explore various ways that designed chambering
   of elastomers can enhance electroactive polymer (EAP) actuation. Such
   enhancements include structuring of chambers for various mechanical
   functions and advantages, boosting of surface area of a polymer for
   enhanced ionic migration, construction of advanced electret foams for
   sensing and for tunable hydrophobicity for micro/pumping action, and
   distribution of composite EAP devices throughout the chambered elastomer
   to achieve discrete controllability of electroactive polymer actuators.
   The authors also discuss the chambering of EAP materials themselves for
   enhanced actuation effects.
   With varied design of the chambers of the elastomer, the mechanical and
   structural properties of the elastomer can be tuned to greatly enhance
   EAP actuation. The chambers can be designed in accordion-like bellows to
   achieve extreme elongation with low forces, in spiral geometries to
   effect negative or neutral poisson's ratio under actuation, and with
   embedded fluidic bellows for fluidic actuation or sensing. These are but
   a few examples of the advantages that can be achieved via designed
   chambering of elastomers.
   The authors also discuss various application uses of the described
   chambering technologies. Such chambered elastomers, combined with
   advanced muscle-like actuators, can substantially benefit facelike
   robots (useful for entertainment and education etc), prosthetics, and
   numerous modalities of bio-inspired locomotion. In the efforts of the
   authors to generate facial expression robots with low-power lightweight
   actuators is described.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This study examined the association between energy drink consumption and
   substance use among adolescents and tested whether sex and/or grade
   level (i.e., middle vs. high school) moderate the association. Data were
   derived from the 2017 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey, a
   representative survey of students in 7th to 12th grade. Analyses
   included 10,662 students who self-reported information on energy drink
   consumption and substance use. Poisson regression models were used with
   adjustments for important covariates. Energy drink consumption was
   associated with tobacco cigarette smoking (incidence rate ratio (IRR):
   3.74; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 3.22-4.35), cannabis use (IRR:
   2.90; 95\% CI: 2.53-3.32), binge drinking (IRR: 2.46; 95\% CI:
   2.05-2.96), opioid use (IRR: 2.23; 95\% CI: 1.85-2.68), and alcohol use
   (IRR: 1.31; 95\% CI: 1.26-1.36). The associations of energy drink
   consumption with tobacco cigarette smoking, cannabis use, and alcohol
   consumption were modified by grade level (two-way interaction terms p <
   0.05). The association between energy drink consumption and substance
   use was generally much stronger among middle school students compared
   with high school students. The findings suggest that middle school
   students may be more vulnerable to the negative effects of energy drinks
   in relation with substance use.}},

Month = {{APR 13}},
Abstract = {{Based on a first principles approach, we study structural, electronic
   and elastic properties, as well as stabilities of all possible
   half-oxidized phosphorene conformers. Stability analysis reveals that
   oxygen chemisorption is an exothermic process in the six configurations
   despite the formation of interstitial oxygen bridges in three of them.
   Electronic structure calculations show that oxidation induces a band gap
   modulation ranging between 0.54 and 1.57 eV in the generalized gradient
   approximation corrected to 1.19 and 2.88 eV using GW. The mechanical
   response of the conformers is sensitively dependent on direction and
   indicates that the new derivatives are incompressible materials and one
   configuration has an auxetic behavior. The present results provide a
   basis for tailoring the electronic and elastic properties of phosphorene
   via half oxidation.}},

   capability is possible using the contact. A high-strain morphing
   aircraft skin is examined as an application of these mechanisms. The

Title = {{Crashworthiness analysis and multi-objective optimization for honeycomb
   structures under oblique impact loading}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRASHWORTHINESS}},
Abstract = {{Oblique impact loading conditions are unavoidable in practical
   applications, which strongly influence the performance response of
   energy-absorbing structures. In this paper, the finite element models of
   four typical cellular structures (hexagon honeycomb, re-entrant hexagon
   honeycomb, star-shape honeycomb, double arrow honeycomb) are established
   and experimentally validated. The dynamic responses of four structures
   under different impact angles (from 0 to 30 degrees) and impact
   velocities (from 5 to 50 m/s) are investigated. On this basis, the
   influences of impact angle and impact velocity on the specific energy
   absorption (SEA) and peak crushing force (PCF) of four structures are
   discussed. The results reveal that the negative Poisson's ratio
   structure has the advantage of energy absorption under axial impact due
   to the characteristics of compression and contraction at the low impact
   velocity. The hexagonal honeycomb structure has great advantages in
   terms of comprehensive energy absorption capacity and better stability
   at varying inclination angles. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
   Algorithm (NSGA-II) coupled with the ideal point method (IPM) is
   utilised to explore the optimal design of hexagon honeycomb structure,
   which is then verified by a detailed crashworthiness comparison with the
   original design. The optimal honeycomb structure shows excellent
   crashworthiness characteristics and demonstrates great potential for
   applications in impact engineering, especially the oblique impact
   loading situations.}},

Abstract = {{The work presents a design study for an aeronautical flap capable of
   smooth and progressive shape variations. Optimal configurations for
   takeoff and landing are taken from literature to define a reference
   design case and the corresponding loading conditions. An extraction
   mechanism to set the flap in optimal position is identified. Then, a
   morphing composite structure is devised to smoothly and progressively
   change the shape of the high lift device to enhance the functions and
   the versatility of such aerodynamic surface. An internal structure based
   on chiral auxetic cellular topology and a skin system supported by a
   corrugated composite panel are proposed. The technological processes for
   manufacturing such components are presented and discussed. A
   parameterized finite element model of the morphing flap is developed and
   structural analyses are carried out to investigate the feasibility of
   the morphing concept.}},

Abstract = {{Stereotypic behavior is an important indicator of compromised welfare.
   Zoo elephants are documented to perform stereotypic behavior, but the
   factors that contribute to performance have not been systematically
   assessed. We collected behavioral data on 89 elephants (47 African
   {[}Loxodonta africana], 42 Asian {[}Elephas maximus]) at 39 North
   American zoos during the summer and winter. Elephants were videoed for a
   median of 12 daytime hours per season. A subset of 32 elephants (19
   African, 13 Asian) was also observed live for a median of 10.5 nighttime
   hours. Percentages of visible behavior scans were calculated from five
   minute instantaneous samples. Stereotypic behavior was the second most
   commonly performed behavior (after feeding), making up 15.5\% of
   observations during the daytime and 24.8\% at nighttime. Negative
   binomial regression models fitted with generalized estimating equations
   were used to determine which social, housing, management, life history,
   and demographic variables were associated with daytime and nighttime
   stereotypic behavior rates. Species was a significant risk factor in
   both models, with Asian elephants at greater risk (daytime: p<0.001,
   Risk Ratio = 4.087; nighttime: p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 8.015). For both
   species, spending time housed separately (p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 1.009),
   and having experienced inter-zoo transfers (p<0.001, Risk Ratio =
   1.175), increased the risk of performing higher rates of stereotypy
   during the day, while spending more time with juvenile elephants
   (p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 0.985), and engaging with zoo staff reduced this
   risk (p = 0.018, Risk Ratio = 0.988). At night, spending more time in
   environments with both indoor and outdoor areas (p = 0.013, Risk Ratio =
   0.987) and in larger social groups (p = 0.039, Risk Ratio = 0.752)
   corresponded with reduced risk of performing higher rates of stereotypy,
   while having experienced inter-zoo transfers (p = 0.033, Risk Ratio =
   1.115) increased this risk. Overall, our results indicate that factors
   related to the social environment are most influential in predicting
   elephant stereotypic behavior rates.}},

Title = {{Prevalence and correlates of depressive symptoms among gay, bisexual and

Abstract = {{Objectives The aim of this analysis is to: (i) assess the prevalence of
   clinically significant depressive symptoms at baseline and follow-up for
   participants in the PROUD trial of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP),
   examining changes in prevalence over time and (ii) investigate the
   association of socioeconomic and psychosocial factors with depression.
   Methods PROUD was an open label randomised trial evaluating the benefit
   of PrEP for 544 HIV-negative gay, bisexual and other men who have sex
   with men (GBMSM) in England. Enrolment was between 2012 and 2014, with
   at least 2 years follow-up. Prevalence of depression (score >= 10 on
   Patient Health Questionnaire-9) was assessed and compared across
   time-points (using McNemar's chi(2) tests) and between trial arms (using
   chi(2) tests). Cross-sectional associations with socioeconomic and
   psychosocial factors were examined using baseline data in modified
   Poisson regression models and combined 12 and 24 month follow-up data in
   generalised estimating equations (GEEs). Prevalence ratios (PRs) were
   presented as unadjusted PR and adjusted PR (aPR) for age, UK birth,
   sexual identity, university education, London study clinic site and
   calendar time (and follow-up time-point in GEEs).
   Results Depression increased significantly from baseline (9.1\%; 49/540)
   to the 12 month (14.4\%; 59/410) and 24 month (14.4\%; 48/333)
   follow-ups, possibly explained by underreporting at baseline. The
   prevalence of depression did not differ by study trial arm, at any
   time-point. In the baseline analysis, younger age, unemployment and
   crystal methamphetamine use, was associated with depression. In combined
   analysis of 12 and 24 month data, measures of intimate partner violence
   (IPV) (lifetime IPV victimisation aPR 2.57 (95\% CI: 1.71 to 3.86)),
   internalised homophobia (aPR 1.91 (95\% CI: 1.29 to 2.83)) and
   concealment of sexual identity (aPR 1.75 (95\% CI: 1.16 to 2.65)), were
   strongly associated with depression.
   Conclusions There is a high concomitant burden of psychosocial factors
   with depression among GBMSM.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss an innovation in traveltime tomography that combines
   wavelet-based, multiscale parameterization and finite-frequency theory
   to solve two outstanding issues that inevitably arise from uneven source
   station distributions and from the three-dimensional (3-D) nature of
   wavefront healing: how to objectively address the intrinsically
   multiscale nature of data coverage while simultaneously maintain model
   resolution at each scale level. We apply the new, integrated methodology
   to investigate 3-D variations of P and S wave speeds (delta InVP and
   delta InVS) beneath the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen. In particular, we are
   able to constrain variations in the Poisson's ratio via delta
   In(V-P/V-S). The formulation is naturally data adaptive, resolving
   features at each scale only if the required data converge is available.
   The very first, long-wavelength feature that emerges is a clear anomaly
   of high delta InV that extends over more than 500 km beyond the northern
   edge of the Lhasa terrane at places. Farther northward, a strong
   negative anomaly underlies the region where recent volcanism occurs in
   northern Tibet. Regions of negative delta In(V-P/V-S) delineate a
   slab-like, subhorizontal feature concentrated between depths of similar
   to 100-250 km. Such characteristics are consistent with the notion that
   chemically refractory, and therefore buoyant, mantle lithosphere of the
   Indian shield ({''}Greater India{''}) has advanced subhorizontally
   northward far beyond the surficial Bangong-Nujiang suture. In the crust,
   two isolated regions of low delta InV, each extending to depths near 100
   km, occur along the Lunggar and the Yadong-Gulu active rifts in southern
   Tibet. Deep penetrating rifts imply that only a limited amount of
   horizontal displacement is being accommodated on subvertical structures.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The prevalence of waterpipe tobacco smoking (WPTS) is
   increasing worldwide. The aims of this study were (a) to evaluate the
   psychometric properties of the Lebanon Waterpipe Dependence Scale
   (LWDS-11), and (b) to assess, estimate, and identify factors associated
   with waterpipe tobacco dependence symptoms among U.K. male adult
   resident waterpipe tobacco smokers.
   A total of 180 waterpipe tobacco smokers were recruited during random
   visits to 7 outlets serving waterpipe tobacco. Data were collected via
   face-to-face interviews using the WPTS module of the Global Adult
   Tobacco Survey and the LWDS-11. Descriptive statistics, exploratory
   psychometric, univariate, and Poisson regression analysis were employed.
   Participants M/SD age was 29.46/9.41 years, Arabic ethnicity accounted
   for 58.3\%, and 53.9\% had completed more than secondary education.
   Psychometric analyses for the LWDS-10, after removing 1 item from the
   generic scale, revealed Cronbachs alpha coefficient 0.74. About 47\% of
   the sample demonstrated waterpipe tobacco dependence. Being Arab (p
   .040, OR 2.63, 95\% CI 1.056.62), smoking waterpipe daily in the past (p
   .003, OR 2.13, 95\% CI 1.303.49), and an increase in length in the last
   session of WPTS (p .044, OR 1.15, 95\% CI 1.001.32) were identified as
   risk factors for waterpipe tobacco dependence.
   This study demonstrated the potential of LWDS-11 and revealed 2 domains:
   positive and negative reinforcement and physiological dependence.
   Results indicated that waterpipe tobacco smokers in the United Kingdom
   demonstrated tobacco dependence symptoms, which were associated with
   socio-behavioral factors. Generalizability of these findings and their
   implications in public health are yet to be investigated.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of rock properties such as velocity, porosity, and diagenesis
   processes was comprehensively investigated to analyse the Amplitude
   Variation with Offset (AVO) on Baturaja carbonate formation at the
   northern part of the West Java Basin. The AVO analysis consists of the
   subsurface condition modeling and the AVO data field. Firstly, the
   subsurface carbonate modeling was applied by Shuey equation and
   Aki-Richard formula using P-wave, S-wave, density, Poisson's ratio, and
   porosity as the parameters. In this simulation, the amplitude
   corresponding to the angle or offset for each layers were obtained. The
   AVO attributes such as intercept (A) and gradient (B) were produced by
   analysing the amplitude. Interestingly, the value of A was positive and
   the gradient was negative which can be related to the carbonate
   formation. The property of the attributes was AVO class-II and the
   product of A and B which would be negative in the value are important
   for hydrocarbon indicator. AVO data field was analyzed, the preserve
   amplitude was obtained, and the noise was reduced. The subsurface
   condition modeling was applied in two different well locations and also
   the facies. It was found that the two wells showed different AVO
   attributes although the porosity distribution was relatively same around
   18\% and 20\%. The AVO attributes in one of the wells was similar to the
   model with shifting polarization while another well has no shifting
   polarization. Overall, some parameters in AVO data analysis should be
   considered since not only the velocity and porosity can influence the
   amplitude but also the diagenesis processes of the rocks can do. We
   believe that our work is very useful to reduce some pitfalls and risks
   in AVO analysis on the carbonates formation.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness and efficiency of any road safety policy measure

   reports on the distribution of unreported accidents among Malaysian
   drivers. Based on survey conducted to 2000 Malaysian drivers, we measure
   the under-reporting information through three variables which are count,
   proportions and ratio of the unreported accidents. Our aim is to find
   the best distribution that describes the features of unreported
   accidents for three variables studied. Results shown that for the count
   data, the best fitted distribution is Negative Binomial whereas for the

Abstract = {{Introduction: In South Africa, evidence shows high HIV prevalence in
   older populations, with sexual behavior consistent with high HIV
   acquisition and transmission risk. However, there is a dearth of
   evidence on older people's HIV incidence. Methods: We used a 2010-2011
   cohort of HIV-negative adults in rural South Africa who were 40 years or
   older at retest in 2015-2016 to estimate HIV incidence over a 5-year
   period. We used Poisson regression to measure the association of HIV
   seroconversion with demographic and behavioral covariates. We used
   inverse probability sampling weights to adjust for nonresponse in 2015,
   based on a logistic regression with predictors of sex and age group at
   August 2010. Results: HIV prevalence increased from 21\% at baseline to
   23\% in the follow-up survey. From a cohort of 1360 individuals, 33
   seroconverted from HIV negative at baseline, giving an overall HIV
   incidence rate of 0.39 per 100 person-years {[}95\% confidence interval
   (CI): 0.28 to 0.57]. The rate for women was 0.44 (95\% CI: 0.30 to
   0.67), double than that for men, 0.21 (95\% CI: 0.10 to 0.51). Incidence
   rate ratios (IRRs) again show women's risk of seroconverting double than
   that of men (IRR = 2.04,Pvalue = 0.098). In past age 60, the IRR of
   seroconversion was significantly lower than that for those in their 40s
   (60-69, IRR = 0.09,Pvalue = 0.002; 70-79, IRR = 0.14,Pvalue = 0.010).
   Conclusions: The risk of acquiring HIV is not zero for people older than
   50 years, especially women. Our findings highlight the importance of
   acknowledging that older people are at high risk of HIV infection and
   that HIV prevention and treatment campaigns must take them into
   consideration.}},

Title = {{Do suicide rates in children and adolescents change during school
   closure in Japan? The acute effect of the first wave of COVID-19
   pandemic on child and adolescent mental health}},
Journal = {{CHILD ABUSE \& NEGLECT}},

Abstract = {{Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has severely
   impacted the lives of children and adolescents. School closure, one of
   the critical changes during the first COVID-19 wave, caused decreases in
   social contacts and increases in family time for children and
   adolescents. This can have both positive and negative influences on
   suicide, which is one of the robust mental health outcomes. However, the
   impact of the COVID-19 crisis on children and adolescents in terms of
   suicide is unknown.
   Objective: This study investigates the acute effect of the first wave of
   the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide among children and adolescents during
   school closure in Japan.
   Data: Total number of suicides per month among children and adolescents
   under 20 years old between January 2018 and May 2020.
   Methods: Poisson regression was used to examine whether suicide
   increased or decreased during school closure, which spanned from March
   to May 2020, compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019. Robustness
   check was conducted using all data from January 2018 to May 2020.
   Negative binomial regression, a model with overdispersion, was also
   performed.
   Results: We found no significant change in suicide rates during the
   school closure (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.15, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI): 0.81 to 1.64). We found the main effect of month, that
   is, suicides significantly increased suicides in May (IRR: 1.34, 95\%
   CI: 1.01 to 1.78) compared to March, but the interaction terms of month
   and school closure were not significant (p > 0.1).
   Conclusions: As preliminary findings, this study suggests that the first
   wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has not significantly affected suicide
   rates among children and adolescents during the school closure in Japan.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Healthcare-associated infections in neonatal and paediatric
   populations are associated with poorer outcomes and healthcare costs,
   and surveillance is a necessary component of prevention programmes.
   Aim: To evaluate burden of illness, aetiology, and time-trends for
   central and peripheral line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI and
   PLABSI) in Australian neonatal and paediatric intensive care units
   (ICUs) between July 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2016.
   Methods: Using National Healthcare Safety Network methods, surveillance
   in neonatal and paediatric units was performed by hospitals
   participating in the Victorian Healthcare Associated Infection
   Surveillance System. Mixed effects Poisson regression was used to model
   infections over time.
   Findings: Overall, 82 paediatric CLABSI events were reported during
   37,125 CVC-days (2.21 per 1000 CVC-days), 203 neonatal CLABSI events
   were reported during 92,169 CVC-days (2.20 per 1000 CVC-days), and 95
   neonatal PLABSI events were reported during 142,240 peripheral line-days
   (0.67 per 1000 peripheral line-days). Over time, a significant decrease
   in quarterly risk for neonatal CLABSI events was observed (risk ratio
   (RR): 0.98; 95\% confidence interval: 0.97-0.99; P - 0.023) and this
   reduction was significant for the 751-1000 g birth weight cohort (RR:
   0.97; P - 0.015). Most frequently, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus
   spp. (24.2\%) and Staphylococcus aureus (16.1\%) were responsible for
   CLABSI events. A significant reduction in Gram-negative neonatal
   infections was observed (annual RR: 0.85; P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: CLABSI rates in neonatal and paediatric ICUs in our region
   are low, and neonatal infections have significantly diminished over
   time. Evaluation of infection prevention programmes is required to
   determine whether specific strategies can be implemented to further
   reduce infection risk. (C) 2017 The Healthcare Infection Society.

Title = {{Association between maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding and
   postpartum depression symptoms}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Due to the multiple health benefits of breastfeeding, it is essential to
   identify factors that may negatively interfere with this healthy
   practice. Among such factors are postpartum depression (PPD) and
   maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding. The objective of this study
   was to evaluate the association between maternal satisfaction with
   breastfeeding and symptoms of PPD in the first month after childbirth.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study nested in a cohort study was conducted in
   Porto Alegre, Brazil, with 287 puerperal women selected at two maternity
   hospitals, one public and one private. Women were interviewed at their
   homes the week after the infant completed 30 days of life. A structured
   questionnaire was applied, as well as instruments to evaluate maternal
   satisfaction with breastfeeding (Maternal Breastfeeding Evaluation
   Scale) and to screen for PPD (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). The
   association between higher satisfaction with breastfeeding (outcome) and
   negative PPD screening test was assessed using Poisson regression with
   robust variance, adjusting for specific covariables. Adjusted prevalence
   ratios (aPR) and respective 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI) were
   estimated.
   Results
   The prevalence of increased satisfaction with breastfeeding (defined as
   women with scores above the median) was 47\% higher among women who
   screened negative for PPD when compared to those with a positive result
   (aPR 1.47; 95\%CI 1.01-2.16). This result was adjusted for maternal age
   and skin color, cohabitation with the infant's father, planned
   pregnancy, type of delivery, exclusive breastfeeding, and occurrence of
   breastfeeding problems.
   Conclusions
   The findings of this study showed an association between higher maternal
   satisfaction with breastfeeding and absence of PPD symptoms, reinforcing
   the importance of caring for the mental health of pregnant and puerperal
   women and paying attention to their satisfaction with breastfeeding.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and to identify sociodemographic
   and oral health factors associated with the negative impact of oral
   health conditions on the quality of life in adolescents.
   METHODS: Data from 5,445 adolescents aged 15-19, who took part in the
   Brazilian Oral Health Survey (SBBrasil 2010) were analyzed, using a
   multistage sampling design. The outcome was quality of life related to
   oral health, which was assessed using the Oral Impacts on Daily
   Performance questionnaire and analyzed as a discrete variable. The
   independent variables were sex, skin color, schooling, household income,
   age, untreated dental caries, malocclusion, gingival bleeding, dental
   calculus, and periodontal pocket. Poisson regression analysis was
   carried out and mean ratios (MR) with their respective 95\% confidence
   intervals (95\%CI) were presented.
   RESULTS: Of the total, 39.4\% reported at least one negative impact on
   their quality of life. After adjustment, the mean negative impact was
   1.52 (95\%CI 1.16;2.00) times higher in females and 1.42 (95\%CI
   1.01;1.99), 2.66 (95\%CI 1.40;5.07) and 3.32 (95\%CI 1.68;6.56) higher
   in those with brown, yellow, and indigenous skin color, respectively,
   when compared to those with white skin. The lower the level of
   schooling, the greater the negative impact (MR 2.11, 95\%CI 1.30;3.41),
   likewise for individuals with household income below R\$500.00 (MR 1.84,
   95\%CI 1.06;3.17) compared with those with higher incomes. The greatest
   impact on quality of life was found among adolescents with four or more
   teeth with untreated dental caries (MR 1.53, 95\%CI 1.12;2.10), one or
   more missing teeth (MR 1.44, 95\%CI 1.16;1.80), those with dental pain
   (RM 3.62, 95\%CI 2.93;4.46) and with severe (MR 1.52, 95\%CI 1.04;2.23)
   and very severe malocclusion (MR 1.32, 95\%CI 1.01;1.72).
   CONCLUSIONS: Brazilian adolescents reported a high negative impact of
   oral health on their quality of life. Inequalities in distribution
   should be taken into account when planning preventive, monitoring and
   treatment strategies for oral health problems in groups with the highest
   impact on their quality of life.}},

Title = {{A time-trend ecological study for identifying flood-sensitive infectious
   diseases in Guangxi, China from 2005 to 2012}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Background: Flood-related damage can be very severe and include health
   effects. Among those health impacts, infectious diseases still represent
   a significant public health problem in China. However, there have been
   few studies on the identification of the spectrum of infectious diseases
   associated with floods in one area. This study aimed to quantitatively
   identify sensitive infectious diseases associated with floods in
   Guangxi, China.
   Methods: A time-trend ecological design was conducted. A descriptive
   analysis was first performed to exclude infectious diseases with low
   incidence from 2005 to 2012 in ten study sites of Guangxi. The Wilcoxon
   rank-sum test was applied to examine the difference in the ten-day
   attack rate of infectious diseases between the exposure and control
   periods with different lagged effects. Negative binomial, zero-inflated
   Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to examine
   the relationship and odd ratios (ORs) of the risk of floods on
   infectious diseases of preliminary screening.
   Results: A total of 417,271 infectious diseases were notified. There
   were 11 infectious diseases associated with floods in the preliminary
   screening process for flood-sensitive infectious diseases. The strongest
   effect was shown with a 0-9 ten-day lag in different infectious
   diseases. Multivariate analysis showed that floods were significantly
   associated with an increased the risk of bacillary dysentery (odds ratio
   (OR) = 1.268, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.072-1.500), acute
   haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC, OR = 3.230, 95\% CI: 1.976-5.280),
   influenza A (H1N1) (OR = 1.808, 95\% CI: 1.721-1.901), tuberculosis (OR
   = 1.200, 95\% CI: 1.036-1.391), influenza (OR = 2.614, 95\% CI:
   1.476-4.629), Japanese encephalitis (OR = 2.334, 95\% CI: 1.119-4.865),
   and leptospirosis (OR = 1.138, 95\% CI: 1.075-1.205), respectively.
   Conclusion. The spectrum of infectious diseases which are associated
   with floods are bacillary dysentery, AHC, influenza A (H1N1),
   tuberculosis, influenza, Japanese encephalitis and leptospirosis in
   Guangxi. Floods can result in differently increased risk of these
   diseases, and public health action should be taken to control a
   potential risk of these diseases after floods.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate trends in all-cause adult mortality after the
   roll-out of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme in rural Uganda.
   Methods Longitudinal population-based cohort study of approximately 20
   000 residents in rural Uganda. Mortality in adults aged 1559 years was
   determined for the 5-year period (19992003) before introduction of ART
   in January 2004 and for the 5-year period afterwards. Poisson regression
   was used to estimate mortality rate ratios (RRs) for the period before
   ART, 1 year after ART introduction (from January 2004 to January 2005)
   and more than 1 year after ART introduction. Trends in mortality were
   analysed by HIV status, age and sex. Results Before ART became
   available, the mortality rate (deaths per 1000 person-years) was 4.0
   (95\% CI = 3.34.8) among HIV-negative individuals and 116.4 (95\% CI =
   101.9133.0) among HIV-positive individuals. During the period January
   2004end November 2009, 279 individuals accessed ART. In the year after
   ART was introduced, the mortality rate (deaths per 1000 person-years)
   among HIV-negative individuals did not change significantly (adjusted RR
   = 0.95, 95\% CI = 0.611.47), but among HIV-positive individuals dropped
   by 25\% to 87.4 (adjusted RR = 0.75, 95\% CI = 0.531.06). In the period
   20052009, the mortality rate (deaths per 1000 person-years) among
   HIV-positive individuals fell further to 39.9 (adjusted RR = 0.33, 95\%
   CI = 0.260.43). The effect was greatest among individuals aged 3044
   years, and trends were similar in men and women. Conclusion The
   substantially reduced mortality rate among HIV-positive individuals
   after ART roll-out lends further support to the intensification of
   efforts to ensure universal access to ART.}},

Abstract = {{Traps for monitoring of flying insect pests constitute a critical part
   of integrated pest management strategies. However, interpretation of
   trap captures is hampered by 1) factors associated with the performance
   of traps (i.e., lure, trap design, placement); 2) an often poorly
   defined relationship between trap captures and population density; and
   3) interpretation approaches being highly specific to a certain insect
   species, trapping method, or trapping environment. The main purpose of
   this study was to identify a trap capture interpretation approach with
   little sensitivity to characteristics specific to a given data set,
   which would allow easier comparison of trapping data sets and make it
   easier to standardize sampling plans across insect pests and trapping
   environments. Based on fits of trapping data sets to standard
   distributions (normal, Poisson, and negative binomial), evaluations of
   the index of aggregation, k, and linear regression coefficients from
   Taylor's power law, we concluded that these characteristics varied
   considerably among data sets, which means that enumerative sampling
   plans may not be appropriate. Across 13 trapping data sets of six insect
   species, we showed a consistent nonlinear relationship between average
   trap captures and number of traps with zero captures and that the k can
   be stabilized by converting trapping data into binomial data. A trap
   interpretation approach based on number of zero captures is both easy to
   use, was found to be species-independent, and means that it may be
   possible to establish meaningful and reliable action thresholds based on
   trap captures of flying insects. Although developed using trapping data
   from food facilities, this approach may have application to trapping
   data from other environments as well.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the factors that determine the spatial distribution of
   biodiversity is a major focus of ecological research. These factors vary
   with scale from interspecific interactions to global climatic cycles.
   Wetlands are important biodiversity hotspots and contributors of
   ecosystem services, but the association between proportional wetland
   cover and species richness has shown mixed results. It is not well known
   as to what extent there is a relationship between proportional wetland
   cover and species richness, especially at the sub-continental scale. We
   used the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) to model wetland cover for
   the conterminous United States and the National Land Cover Database to
   estimate wetland change between 2001 and 2011. We used a Bayesian
   spatial Poisson model to estimate a spatially varying coefficient
   surface describing the effect of proportional wetland cover on the
   distribution of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles and the
   cumulative distribution of terrestrial endemic species. Species richness
   and wetland cover were significantly correlated, and this relationship
   varied both spatially and by taxonomic group. Rather than a
   continental-scale association, however, we found that this relationship
   changed more closely among ecoregions. The species richness of each of
   the five groups was positively associated with wetland cover in some or
   all of the Great Plains; additionally, a positive association was found
   for mammals in the Southeastern Plains and Piedmont of the eastern U.S.
   Model results indicated negative association especially in the Cold
   Deserts and Northern Lakes \& Forests of Minnesota and Wisconsin, though
   these varied greatly between groups. Our results highlight the need for
   wetland conservation initiatives that focus efforts at the level II and
   III ecoregional scale rather than along political boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Pediatric inpatient mortality rates are as high as 11\% in parts of
   sub-Saharan Africa. Unscheduled clinic visits also burden children in
   sub-Saharan Africa. Our objective was to identify factors associated
   with hospital admissions and unscheduled clinic visits among Tanzanian
   children < 24 months of age.
   Methods:
   We conducted a secondary analysis of 2 trials conducted in Dar es
   Salaam, Tanzania. We performed univariate and Poisson multivariable
   regression analyses to identify factors associated with hospital
   admissions and unscheduled clinic visits.
   Results:
   Of 4784 children < 24 months of age, 293 (6.1\%) were hospitalized at
   least once and 1308 (27.3\%) had >= 1 unscheduled clinic visit. Infants
   and children who were exposed to but HIV-negative had increased risk of
   hospital admission {[}adjusted risk ratios (aRR): 3.67; 95\% CI:
   2.45-5.50; P < 0.001] compared with HIV-unexposed children. Those who
   were HIV-positive had even higher risk of hospital admission compared
   with those not exposed to HIV (aRR: 10.87; 95\% CI: 7.01-16.89; P <
   0.001). Birth weight and breast-feeding status were not associated with
   increased risk of hospital admission. Children with Apgar scores < 7
   (aRR: 1.32; 95\% CI: 1.03-1.69; P = 0.001), not exclusively breast-fed
   up to 6 months of age (aRR: 1.34; 95\% CI: 1.12-1.60; P = 0.001), and
   who were HIV-exposed and HIV-negative (aRR: 2.35; 95\% CI: 2.08-2.66; P
   < 0.001) or HIV-positive (aRR: 3.02; 95\% CI: 2.52-3.61; P < 0.001) had
   higher risk of unscheduled clinic visits.
   Conclusions:
   Exposure to HIV and being HIV-positive were associated with the greatest
   risk for hospital admission and unplanned clinic visits among infants
   and children in Tanzania. Targeting these vulnerable populations in
   interventional studies may reduce morbidity.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of mutation accumulation in finite, asexual populations
   shows that by modeling discrete individuals, a necessary condition for
   mutation-selection balance is often not met. It is found that over a
   wide parameter range (whenever N e(-mu/s) < 1, where N is the population
   size, mu is the genome-wide mutation rate, and s is the realized
   strength of selection), asexual populations will fail to achieve
   mutation-selection balance. This is specifically because the
   steady-state strength of selection on the best individuals is too weak
   to counter mutation pressure. The discrete nature of individuals means
   that if the equilibrium level of mutation and selection is such that
   less than one individual is expected in a class, then equilibration
   towards this level acts to remove the class. When applied to the classes
   with the fewest mutations, this drives mutation accumulation. This drive
   is in addition to the well-known identification of the stochastic loss
   of the best class as a mechanism for Muller's ratchet. Quantification of
   this process explains why the distribution of the number of mutations
   per individual can be markedly hypodispersed compared to the Poisson
   expectation. The actual distribution, when corrected for stochasticity
   between the best class and the mean, is akin to a shifted negative
   binomial. The parameterization of the distribution allows for an
   approximation for the rate of Muller's ratchet when N e(-mu/s) < 1. The
   analysis is extended to the case of variable selection coefficients
   where incoming mutations assume a distribution of deleterious effects.
   Under this condition, asexual populations accumulate mutations faster,
   yet may be able to survive longer, than previously estimated.}},

   substituted graphdiyne under biaxial strain}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{Recently, a novel layered carbon-based material, i.e. the hydrogen
   substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY), has been synthesized through an in situ
   cross-coupling reaction of triethynylbenzene (Nat. Commun., 2017, 8,
   1172). Herein, the most favorable stacking order for bulk layered HsGDY
   (b-HsGDY) was determined based on firstprinciples calculations, and then
   its mechanical and electronic properties under biaxial strain were
   systematically studied. The results show that the ABC-stacking structure
   is the most favorable configuration for b-HsGDY. Interestingly, this
   material exhibits a behavior similar to an auxetic material under
   biaxial tensile strain and its band gap increases with the increase of
   either the tensile strain or the compression strain within the strain
   range of - 0.03 <= epsilon <= 0.05. These extraordinary properties endow
   the b-HsGDY with great potential in designing electromechanical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Describe the inequalities in oral health in children treated
   in a hospital located in a deprived urban area in the UK. Research
   design: Case-note review of 1911 0-17-year-olds who underwent dental
   extractions under a general anaesthetic (DGA). Main outcome measures:
   Associations between Age, Ethnicity, Year-of-Treatment and Index of
   Multiple Deprivation (IMD) with the number of teeth extracted. Analysis
   used multilevel modelling assuming a Poisson distribution. Results: Mean
   number of teeth extracted was higher in the youngest children treated
   aged 0-5 years (relative risk coefficient, (RR=exp(beta)=1.39; 95\% CI
   1.24 to 1.56) compared to those aged 6-17 years and in `Other Whites'
   (predominantly immigrants from Eastern Europe) (RR=exp(beta)=1.34; 95\%
   CI 1.25 to 1.43), `South Asians' (RR=exp(beta)=1.15; 95\% CI 1.08 to
   1.23) but fewer in the `Black' ethnic group (RR=exp(beta)=0.85; 95\% CI
   0.76 to 0.95). DGA increased during the study with more teeth extracted
   in 2015, 2016 and 2017 (RR=exp(beta)=1.12, 95\% CI 1.22, 1.25) and with
   a negative gradient in the rate of DGA's (per decile) in children from
   the most deprived to most affluent locations (RR=exp(beta)=0.98; 95\% CI
   0.97 to 0.99). Conclusions: Significant oral health inequalities exist
   in children from a deprived urban area in the UK. A preventive approach
   to children's oral health is needed to reduce such inequalities,
   including public health and healthcare agencies to informing parents of
   children whose first language is not English about dental caries.}},

Title = {{Approximation to the Distribution of Fitness Effects across Functional
   Categories in Human Segregating Polymorphisms}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Quantifying the proportion of polymorphic mutations that are deleterious
   or neutral is of fundamental importance to our understanding of
   evolution, disease genetics and the maintenance of variation
   genome-wide. Here, we develop an approximation to the distribution of
   fitness effects (DFE) of segregating single-nucleotide mutations in
   humans. Unlike previous methods, we do not assume that synonymous
   mutations are neutral or not strongly selected, and we do not rely on
   fitting the DFE of all new nonsynonymous mutations to a single
   probability distribution, which is poorly motivated on a biological
   level. We rely on a previously developed method that utilizes a variety
   of published annotations (including conservation scores, protein
   deleteriousness estimates and regulatory data) to score all mutations in
   the human genome based on how likely they are to be affected by negative
   selection, controlling for mutation rate. We map this and other
   conservation scores to a scale of fitness coefficients via maximum
   likelihood using diffusion theory and a Poisson random field model on
   SNP data. Our method serves to approximate the deleterious DFE of
   mutations that are segregating, regardless of their genomic consequence.
   We can then compare the proportion of mutations that are negatively
   selected or neutral across various categories, including different types
   of regulatory sites. We observe that the distribution of intergenic
   polymorphisms is highly peaked at neutrality, while the distribution of
   nonsynonymous polymorphisms has a second peak at s approximate
   to-10(-4). Other types of polymorphisms have shapes that fall roughly in
   between these two. We find that transcriptional start sites, strong
   CTCF-enriched elements and enhancers are the regulatory categories with
   the largest proportion of deleterious polymorphisms.}},

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{56}},

Pages = {{165-177}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{A clinical trial was carried out in two provinces of Canada to
   investigate the effect of treatment with eprinomectin at calving on
   production parameters in adult dairy cattle in 1999-2000. One of the
   objectives of this study was to evaluate the impact of treatment on
   reproductive performance as measured by: calving-to-conception interval,
   calving-to-first service interval and number of services per conception.
   The ability of an indirect ELISA using a crude adult Ostertagia
   ostertagi antigen to predict response to treatment also was evaluated.
   All lactating cows in 20 dairy herds were allocated randomly to receive
   either eprinomectin pour-on or placebo at calving. Information on
   reproductive parameters was obtained from computerised cow records.
   Survival models were used to evaluate the effect of treatment on the two
   intervals and a Poisson model was used to evaluate the number of
   services to conception. A total of 549 cows were included in these
   analyses. A marginally significant treatment effect on
   calving-to-conception interval was observed (hazard ratio = 1.24, P =
   0.06) but not on calving-to-first service interval. A significant
   reduction in the number of breedings to conception for treated animals
   also was observed with a longer effect in cows with short interval to
   first service. Milk samples from a subset of 109 late-lactation cows
   were tested for antibodies against O. ostertagi. The ELISA
   optical-density ratio (ODR) values obtained between 120 days before
   calving and drying off were categorised as high ODR (greater than or
   equal to0.5) and low ODR (<0.5). Among untreated animals, the hazard of
   conception was lower (hazard ratio = 0.38, 95\% Cl = {[}0.19, 0.75]) for
   high-ODR cows compared to low ODR cows suggesting that higher parasite
   burdens had an adverse effect on reproductive performance. Treated
   high-ODR cows had a hazard of conception equivalent to the hazard for
   all cows in the low-ODR group (indicating that treatment prevented the
   negative effect associated with these higher parasite burdens). (C) 2002

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the deformation of a chiral elastic bar
   subjected to a thermal field. The bar is composed of two different

   materials by using the equilibrium theory of Cosserat thermoelasticity.
   The temperature variation is assumed to be a polynomial in the axial
   coordinate. It is shown that a plane thermal field, in contrast with the
   result predicted by the theory of achiral materials, produces torsional
   effects. The solution of the problem could be used to investigate the
   behavior of bone implants and other compound cylinders. The method is
   applied to the case of a circular bar reinforced by a longitudinal

Abstract = {{Neonates are among the most vulnerable patient groups for healthcare

   Interpretation of neonatal bloodstream infection (BSI) rates requires
   stratification for case-mix. We assessed 1367 consecutive admissions to
   a single neonatal unit over a 34-month period. Four intrinsic and seven
   extrinsic risks were evaluated using Poisson regression analyses both
   individually and in combination. Nine of the 11 evaluated risk factors
   were significantly associated with BSI on univariate analyses. The only
   significant independent risks were parenteral nutrition, whether
   administered centrally or peripherally {[}incidence rate ratio (IRR):
   14.2; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 8.8-22.9; P < 0.001], and
   gestational age <26 weeks (IRR: 2.5; 95\% CI: 1.7-3.8; P < 0.001). The
   rate of BSI per 1000 patient-days was 40 times higher in infants with
   both of these than in infants with neither. If validated in other
   settings, stratification of neonatal BSI rate by two unambiguous risk
   factors, parenteral nutrition and birth gestational age <26 weeks,
   offers a simple method meaningful intra- and inter-hospital comparisons.

Abstract = {{Background. We determined temporal trends (1985-2011) in hepatitis C
   virus (HCV) incidence and associated behavioral exposures for people who
   inject drugs (PWID) from the United States (Boston, Baltimore, and San
   Francisco), Canada (Montreal), the Netherlands (Amsterdam), and
   Australia (Sydney and Melbourne).
   Methods. Using population-based cohort data from HCV-negative PWID, we
   calculated overall and within-city HCV incidence trends, HCV rates by
   study enrollment period (1985-2011), and temporal trends in exposure
   behaviors. Poisson regression models estimated trends in HCV incidence
   over calendar- time. Survival models identified risk factors for HCV
   incidence across cities and estimated independent effects of city and
   calendar period on HCV infection risk.
   Results. Among 1391 initially HCV-negative participants followed
   prospectively (1644.5 person-years of observation {[}PYO]), 371 HCV
   incident infections resulted in an overall incidence of 22.6 per 100 PYO
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 20.4-25.0). Incidence was highest and
   remained elevated in Baltimore (32.6/100 PYO), San Francisco (24.7/100
   PYO), and Montreal (23.5/100 PYO), lowest in Melbourne and Amsterdam
   (7.5/100 PYO and 13.1/100 PYO, respectively), and moderate (21.4/100
   PYO) in Sydney. Higher rates of syringe and equipment sharing and lower
   prevalence of opioid agonist therapy were associated with HCV incidence
   in cities with the highest incidence. Risk for infection dropped by 18\%
   for every 3-year increase in calendar-time (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.8
   {[}95\% CI,.8-. 9]) in the multivariable model.
   Conclusions. Differences in prevention strategies and injecting contexts
   may explain the ongoing high HCV incidence in these North American
   cities and emphasize the need for scale-up of opioid agonist therapy and
   increased coverage of needle and syringe programs in North America.}},

Abstract = {{Research that examines the associations of psychosocial factors with
   incident hypertension among African Americans (AA) is limited. Using
   Jackson Heart Study (JHS) data, we examined associations of negative
   affect and stress with incident hypertension and blood pressure (BP)
   progression among AA.
   Our sample consisted of 1,656 normotensive participants at baseline
   (2000-2004) (mean age 47 +/- 12; 61\% women). We investigated
   associations of negative affect (cynical distrust, anger-in, anger-out,
   and depressive symptoms) and stress (perceived stress, weekly stress
   inventory (WSI)-event, WSI-impact, and major life events) with BP
   progression (an increase by one BP stage as defined by JNC VII) and
   incident hypertension by examination 2 (2005-2008). Poisson regression
   analysis was utilized to examine the prevalence ratios (PRs; 95\%
   confidence interval (CI)) of BP tracking and incident hypertension with
   psychosocial factors, adjusting for baseline age, sex, socioeconomic
   status (SES), and hypertension risk factors.
   Fifty-six percentage of the sample (922 cases) had BP progression from
   2005 to 2008. After adjustment for age, sex, and SES, a high anger-out
   score was associated with a 20\% increased risk of BP progression
   compared to a low anger-out score (PR 1.20; 95\% CI 1.05-1.36). High
   depressive symptoms score was associated with BP progression in the age,
   sex, and SES-adjusted model (PR 1.14; 95\% CI 1.00-1.30). High WSI-event
   scores were associated with BP progression in the fully adjusted model
   (PR 1.21; 95\% CI 1.04-1.40). We did not observe significant
   associations with any of the psychosocial measures and incident
   hypertension.
   Psychosocial factors were associated with BP progression, with the
   strongest evidence for number of stressful events that occurred.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To study trends in overall deaths and cause-specific deaths
   stratified by hepatitis C virus (HCV) serostatus in a cohort of
   combination antiretroviral (cART)-naive HIV-infected patients in Spain.
   Methods: We analyzed data from 1997 to 2008 in two calendar periods:
   1997-2003 and 2004-2008. Deaths were ascertained through cohort
   reporting and a cross-match with the Spanish National Death Index. We
   used Poisson regression to model mortality rates and risk factors.
   Results: We analyzed 5974 HIV-positive cART-naive patients: 2471 (1497
   HCV positive) in the period 1997-2003, and 3503 (689 HCV positive) in
   the period 2004-2008. A total of 232 deaths (158 during the first
   period, and 74 during the second period) were detected during 19 416
   person-years of follow-up; the death rate was 12.9 of 1000 person-years.
   Crude overall death rates {[}95\% confidence interval (CI)] were 16.5
   (14.2-19.1) in 1997-2003 and 8.5 (6.7-10.6) in 2004-2008. The incidence
   rate ratio (IRR) (95\% CI) in 2004-2008 taking 1997-2003 as a reference
   was 0.51 (0.39-0.67). When we stratified by HCV serostatus, the overall
   death IRR (95\% CI) taking 1997-2003 as reference was 0.52 (0.32-0.85)
   for HCV-negative patients and 1.27 (0.90-1.79) for HCV-positive
   patients. When we considered cause-specific deaths (liver-related,
   AIDS-related, and nonliver-related/non-AIDS-related), findings were
   similar to those for overall-deaths.
   Conclusion: Taking the first years of the cART era as a reference, we
   observed a decrease in overall and cause-specific mortality. This
   decrease was only observed in HCV-negative patients. (C) 2012 Wolters

Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{312-321}},

Abstract = {{The structure of the anode space charge sheath of a vacuum arc is
   studied with allowance for the dependence of the negative anode fall on
   the ratio of the directed electron velocity v (0) to the electron
   thermal velocity v (T) for different values of the flux density of atoms
   evaporated from the anode. Poisson's equation for the sheath potential
   is solved taking into account the electron space charge, fast cathode
   ions, and slow ions produced due to the ionization of atoms evaporated
   from the anode. The kinetic equation for atoms and slow anode ions is
   solved with allowance for ionization in the collision integral. Analytic
   solutions for the velocity distribution functions of atoms and slow ions
   and the density of slow ions are obtained. It is shown that the flux of
   slow ions substantially affects the spatial distribution of the electric
   field E(z) in the sheath. As the flux density increases, the
   nonmonotonic dependence E(z) transforms into a monotonic one and the
   sheath narrows. For a given flux of evaporated atoms I a, the increase
   in the ratio of the directed electron velocity to the electron thermal
   velocity leads again to a nonmonotonic dependence E(z). As z increases,
   the electric field first increases, passes through the maximum,
   decreases, passes through the minimum E (min), and then again increases
   toward the anode. There is a limiting value of the ratio (v (0)/v (T)
   ){*} at which E (min)(z) vanishes. At v (0)/v (T) > (v (0)/V (T) ){*},
   the condition for the existence of a steady-state sheath is violated and
   the profiles of the field and potential in the sheath become
   oscillating. The dependence of (v (0)/v (T) ){*} on the flux density of
   evaporated atoms I (a) is obtained. It is shown that the domain of
   existence of steady-state solutions in the sheath broadens with
   increasing Pi (a) .}},

   analyze the Taiwanese National Health Care Claim database. Conditional
   logistic regression model and conditional Poisson regression model were
   used to estimate the risks of MI/IS. In addition, we used burn patients
   as negative controls to explore the potential effect of residual
   confounding. In total, 123,819 MI patients and 327,179 IS patients in
   the case-crossover design and 117,655 MI patients and 298,757 IS
   patients were included in the self-controlled case series design.
   Results from both study designs showed that the risk of MI within the
   first 24 wk after IDT was not significantly different from or close to
   unity except for a modest risk during the first week for patients
   without other comorbidities (odds ratios {[}95\% confidence intervals]
   of 1.31 {[}1.08-1.58] and 1.15 {[}1.01-1.31] for 3 d and 7 d,
   respectively). We also observed no association between IDTs and IS, or
   the risk ratio was close to unity. IDTs did not appear to be associated
   with a transient risk of MI and IS in the Taiwanese population, with
   consistent findings from both case-only study designs. However, we
   cannot exclude that dental infections and diseases may yield a long-term
   risk of MI and IS.}},

Title = {{Influenza Vaccination Coverage Among US Nursing Home Nursing Assistants:
   The Role of Working Conditions}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To estimate influenza vaccination coverage among nursing
   assistants (NAs) working in US nursing homes, and to identify
   demographic and occupational predictors of vaccination status among NAs.
   Design, setting, and participants: Cross-sectional analysis of data on
   2873 NAs from the 2004 National Nursing Assistant Survey.
   Multivariable-adjusted vaccination coverage (prevalence) ratios for
   demographic and occupational characteristics were calculated using
   Poisson regression.
   Measurements: Outcome variable was NAs' influenza vaccination status,
   yes or no, based on the question, ``During the past 12 months, did you
   receive a flu shot?{''}
   Results: Coverage for all NAs working in US nursing homes was estimated
   to be 37.1\%. NAs 45 or older were more likely to be vaccinated than
   younger NAs (prevalence ratio {[}PR] 1.23, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 1.07-1.41). Significant negative associations with vaccination
   status were found for NAs who were non-Hispanic blacks (PR 0.82, 95\%
   CI: 0.70-0.97), disagreed that they were respected/rewarded for their
   work (PR 0.85, 95\% CI: 0.71-1.00), worked at for-profit facilities (PR
   0.83, 95\% CI: 0.72-0.95), and reported receiving fewer than 7 of 15
   nonwage job benefits (PR 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.67-0.90).
   Conclusion: Influenza coverage among nursing home NAs appears to be
   similar to nationally reported coverage estimates among health care
   providers in the United States in general. In addition to individual
   characteristics, occupational characteristics reflective of working
   conditions are associated with vaccination status among NAs, suggesting
   that further research into these types of associations may be useful in
   identifying which institutions may benefit from outreach efforts and
   types of interventions to increase vaccination coverage. Published by

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Smoking is common in the hemodialysis
   population and is associated with increased all-cause mortality and
   development of cardiovascular disease. Cause-specific outcomes have not
   yet been examined in detail. This study investigated the association of
   baseline smoking status with all-cause, cardiovascular, and
   infection-related morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing
   long-term hemodialysis.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements Post hoc analysis of the
   HEMO Study in patients with available comorbidity, clinical, and
   nutritional data. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fit to
   estimate the association of smoking status with mortality. Poisson and
   negative binomial regression models were fit to estimate the association
   of smoking status with hospitalization rate.
   Results Complete data were available for 1842 individuals (44\% male,
   63\% black, 45\% diabetic). Mean age was 58 +/- 14 years. At baseline,
   17\% were current smokers and 32\% were former smokers. After case-mix
   adjustment, compared with never smoking, current smoking was associated
   with greater infection-related mortality (hazard ratio {[}HR], 2.04;
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.32-3.10) and all-cause mortality (HR,
   1.44; 95\% Cl, 1.16-1.79) and greater cardiovascular (incidence rate
   ratio {[}IRR], 1.49; 95\% Cl, 1.22-1.82), infection-related (IRR, 1.35;
   95\% Cl., 1.11-1.64) and all-cause (IRR, 1.43; 95\% Cl, 1.24-1.65)
   hospitalization rates. The population attributable fraction (i.e.,
   fraction of observed deaths that may have been avoided) was 5.3\% for
   current smokers versus never-smokers and 2.1\% for current versus former
   smokers.

Abstract = {{Two novel folded honeycombs with miura pattern are proposed in this
   paper. Geometry parameters for design process are given and explained.
   The in-plane compressive strength of the two proposed novel folded
   honeycombs has been studied by means of finite element simulation using
   ABAQUS. Quasi-static loading in two in-plane direction is selected to
   obtain the deformation and plateau stress. The unique collapse modes and
   plateau state are obtained and discussed. Compared with the conventional
   honeycombs, the in-plane strength of the two folded honeycombs is
   improved significantly. The negative Poissons ratio effect and
   buckling-restrained mechanism are introduced to illustrate the
   improvement. It is summarized that plateau stress under in-plane loading
   is improved with the included angle of miura pattern decrease for the
   local buckling is restrained. The folded auxetic honeycomb has the best
   in-plane strength for its presented negative Poissons ratio in two

Abstract = {{The investigation of equivalent in-plane properties for hexagonal and

   the partial differential equations associated with their homogenized
   continuum models. A homogenization technique is adopted based on the
   approximation of the discrete lattice equations according to the finite
   differences formalism. The technique can be used in conjunction with a
   finite element (FE) description of the lattice unit cell and therefore
   allows handling structures with different levels of complexity and
   various internal geometries within a general and compact framework that
   can be easily implemented in a numerical code. The in-plane wave
   propagation characteristics of honeycombs can be investigated with the
   proposed approach: approximate phase velocities can be calculated from
   the equations of motion for the low-frequency modes and compared with
   the exact values obtained through a Fourier analysis of the unit cell.}},

Title = {{Structural factors associated with an increased risk of HIV and sexually
   transmitted infection transmission among street-involved youth}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: The prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections
   (STIs) among street-involved youth greatly exceed that of the general
   adolescent population; however, little is known regarding the structural
   factors that influence disease transmission risk among this population.
   Methods: Between September 2005 and October 2006, 529 street-involved
   youth were enroled in a prospective cohort known as the At Risk Youth
   Study (ARYS). We examined structural factors associated with number of
   sex partners using quasi-Poisson regression and consistent condom use
   using logistic regression.
   Results: At baseline, 415 (78.4\%) were sexually active, of whom 253
   (61.0\%) reported multiple sex partners and 288 (69.4\%) reported
   inconsistent condom use in the past six months. In multivariate
   analysis, self-reported barriers to health services were inversely
   associated with consistent condom use (adjusted odds ratio {[}aOR] =
   0.52, 95\% CI: 0.25-1.07). Structural factors that were associated with
   greater numbers of sex partners included homelessness (adjusted
   incidence rate ratio {[}aIRR] = 1.54, 95\% CI: 1.11-2.14) and having an
   area restriction that affects access to services (aIRR = 2.32, 95\% CI:
   1.28-4.18). Being searched or detained by the police was significant for
   males (aIRR = 1.36, 95\% CI: 1.02-1.81).
   Conclusion: Although limited by its cross-sectional design, our study
   found several structural factors amenable to policy-level interventions
   independently associated with sexual risk behaviours. These findings
   imply that the criminalization and displacement of street-involved youth
   may increase the likelihood that youth will engage in sexual risk
   behaviours and exacerbate the negative impact of resultant health
   outcomes. Moreover, our findings indicate that environmental-structural
   interventions may help to reduce the burden of these diseases among
   street youth in urban settings.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Exacerbation-associated uncontrolled asthma represents a
   major public health problem. The relationship of elevated blood
   eosinophils to this process needs study.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a high blood eosinophil count is a risk
   factor for future asthma exacerbations in adult persistent asthma.
   METHODS: By using electronic pharmacy and health care data from Kaiser
   Permanente Southern California, 2392 patients, ages 18 to 64 years, were
   identified who met the Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set
   2-year criteria for persistent asthma, did not manifest chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease and other major illnesses, and had a blood
   eosinophil determination in 2010. Exacerbations (primary outcome) were
   defined as asthma outpatient visits that required systemic
   corticosteroid dispensing within +/-7 days or asthma emergency
   department visits or hospitalizations. A period of >= 8 days defined a
   new exacerbation. Multivariate modelling used negative binomial and
   Poisson regression to examine the association between a blood eosinophil
   count determined in 2010 and risk of exacerbations, and >= 7
   short-acting beta(2)-agonist (SABA) canisters dispensed (secondary
   outcome) in 2011 by adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and
   asthma burden.
   RESULTS: The rate of asthma exacerbations in 2011 was 0.41 events per
   person year (95\% CI, 0.37-0.45). Eosinophil count >= 400/mm(3) in 2010
   was a risk factor for asthma exacerbations in 2011 (adjusted rate ratio
   1.31 {[}95\% CI, 1.07-1.60]; P = .009) and >= 7 SABA dispensed (adjusted
   risk ratio 1.17 {[}95\% CI, 1.03-1.1.33]; P = .015).
   CONCLUSION: A high blood eosinophil count is a risk factor for increased

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Although gastric cancer forms part of the Lynch
   syndrome tumor spectrum, the risk of developing gastric cancer in Lynch
   syndrome families is unknown, resulting in a lack of clear guidelines
   for surveillance. The aim of this study was to evaluate incidence trends
   and risk of developing gastric cancer among Lynch syndrome mutation
   carriers in a Western population. METHODS: Lynch syndrome mutation
   carriers were selected from the Dutch Hereditary Cancer Registry. The
   gastric cancer incidence in Lynch syndrome mutation carriers was
   compared to the gastric cancer incidence in the Dutch population between
   1970 and 2003. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated by a
   Poisson model. Cumulative risks were calculated by Kaplan-Meier
   analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 2014 Lynch syndrome mutation carriers were
   identified. Gastric cancer was diagnosed in 32 (1.6\%) subjects
   (male/female: 21/11), 22 (69\%) of them had a negative family history of
   gastric cancer. The standardized incidence ratios of gastric cancer was
   3.4 (95\% confidence interval, 2.1-5.2) and showed a nonsignificant
   decline between 1970 and 2003 (P = .30). Absolute risk of developing
   gastric cancer also showed no significant change over time (P = .51).
   Lifetime risk of developing gastric cancer was 8.0\% in males vs 5.3\%
   in females (P = .02), and 4.8\% and 9\% for MLH1 and MSH2 carriers,
   respectively. None of the 378 MSH6 carriers developed gastric cancer (P
   = .002 vs MLH1 and MSH2 combined lifetime risk). CONCLUSIONS: Lynch
   syndrome mutation carriers have a substantial risk for gastric cancer,
   in particular patients with an MLH1 or MSH2 mutation. Family history for
   gastric cancer is a poor indicator for individual risk. Surveillance
   gastroscopy for Lynch syndrome patients carrying an MLH1 or MSH2
   mutation should therefore be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the influence of socioeconomic and psychological
   factors on glycemic control in young children with type 1 diabetes
   mellitus.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study assessing prepubertal children
   with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The authors analyzed the socioeconomic
   status using the Brazil Economic Classification Criterion (Criterio de
   Classificacao Economica Brasil {[}CCEB]) and psychological conditions
   through the Brazilian version of the Problem Areas in Diabetes,
   associated with glycemic control, measured by glycated hemoglobin
   (HbA1c). Descriptive analysis was used. The variables were assessed by
   bivariate and multivariate robust Poisson regression model, as well as
   Fisher's exact and Pearson's chi-squared tests to obtain the ratios of
   gross and adjusted prevalence ratio, with confidence interval being
   estimated at 95\%.
   Results: A total of 68 children with type 1 diabetes mellitus were
   included in the study. A negative association between glycemic control
   (glycated hemoglobin levels), socioeconomic status (Brazil Economic
   Classification Criterion), and psychological condition (Brazilian
   version of the Problem Areas in Diabetes) was observed. Among the study
   participants, 73.5\% (n= 50) of the children had an unfavorable
   socioeconomic status; these participants were 1.4 times more likely to
   present altered glycated hemoglobin values. In relation to individuals
   with compromised psychological status, 26 (38.2\%) had a score above 70,
   thus being classified with psychological stress; these children were
   1.68 times more likely (95\% confidence interval: 1.101, 1.301) to have
   higher glycated hemoglobin levels.
   Conclusions: The socioeconomic conditions and psychological
   characteristics of the study participants were negatively associated
   with glycated hemoglobin results. These data reinforce the importance of
   the studied variables as predictors of glycemic control. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Background. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is an important
   infection-related complication, whose mode of transmission remains
   uncertain.
   Methods. We investigated a nosocomial cluster of 14 PJP cases (11
   confirmed and 3 probable) in kidney transplant recipients using
   epidemiological and genotyping methods.
   Results. Poisson regression calculated an incidence density ratio of
   42.8 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 14.1-129.3) versus background
   0.64 cases of 1000 patient-years (P<0.001). All patients presented with
   respiratory failure, 10 required ventilation, two died, and six
   transplants failed, costing \$31,854 (+/- SD \$26,048) per patient.
   Four-locus multilocus sequence typing analysis using DNA extracts from
   11 confirmed cases identified two closely related genotypes, with 9 of
   11 sharing an identical composite multilocus sequence typing genotype.
   Contact tracing found colocalization of cases within clinic waiting
   areas, suggesting person-to-person transmission. Minimal and maximal PJP
   incubation periods were 124 +/- 83 to 172 +/- 71 days, respectively.
   Oropharyngeal washes from outpatient staff and ambient air samples were
   negative for P. jirovecii DNA. Cohort analysis (14 cases vs. 324
   unaffected clinic control patients) identified independent risk factors
   including previous cytomegalovirus infection (odds ratio {[}OR], 65.9;
   95\% CI, 7.9-550; P<0.001), underlying pulmonary disease (OR, 10.1; 95\%
   CI, 2.3-45.0; P=0.002), and transplant dysfunction (OR=1.61 per 10
   mL/min/1.73 m(2), 95\% CI, 1.15-2.25, P=0.006). The outbreak was
   controlled by reintroduction of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
   prophylaxis to all potentially exposed clinic patients and its extension
   to 12 months in recent recipients.
   Conclusions. Nosocomial PJP clusters are likely due to interhuman
   transmission by airborne droplets to susceptible hosts. Prompt
   recognition and a strategy of early preemptive blanket PJP prophylaxis
   to all exposed transplant clinic recipients from the third confirmed
   case are recommended to limit outbreak escalation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Mental health problems are associated with sickness absence
   (SA). The present study aimed at establishing which symptoms-distress,
   depression, anxiety, or somatization-at which symptom levels were
   associated with SA frequency and duration. Moreover, a number of
   possible confounders or effect modifiers were taken into account.
   Methods A survey was completed by 3,678 employees of a large Dutch
   telecom company. Symptoms were measured using the Four-Dimensional
   Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ). SA data were registered by the company's
   occupational health service during the 12 months' period following the
   survey. Poisson regression was used to analyze the number of SA spells
   (SA frequency). Negative binomial regression was used to analyze the
   total number of SA days (SA duration).
   Results In the bivariate analyses distress, depression, anxiety, and
   somatization impacted on SA frequency and duration. In the multivariate
   analyses, anxiety and depression turned out not to be directly
   associated with SA, suggesting that the effect of anxiety and depression
   was due to the association between anxiety/depression and
   distress/somatization. Regarding the SA frequency, the rate ratio for
   `subclinical' distress was 1.13 (95\% CI 1.03-1.25), for `clinical'
   distress 1.26 (1.08-1.47), for `subclinical' somatization 1.34
   (1.23-1.46), and for `clinical' somatization 1.69 (1.46-1.95). Regarding
   the SA duration, the count ratio for `subclinical' distress was 1.15
   (95\% CI 0.91-1.44), for `clinical' distress 1.50 (1.04-2.16), for
   `subclinical' somatization 1.34 (1.10-1.64), and for `clinical'
   somatization 1.45 (1.04-2.03).
   Conclusions Somatization and distress are key to understand why
   depression and anxiety are related to SA.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   With the purpose of reducing the well-known negative impact of late
   presentation (LP) on people living with HIV (PLWH), guidelines on early
   HIV diagnosis were published in 2014 in Spain, but since then no data on
   LP prevalence have been published. To estimate prevalence and risk
   factors of LP and to evaluate their impact on the development of
   clinical outcomes in the Cohort of the Spanish HIV/AIDS Research Network
   (CoRIS) during 2004-2018.
   Methods
   CoRIS is an open prospective multicenter cohort of PLWH, adults, naive
   to ART at entry. LP was defined as HIV diagnosis with CD4 count <= 350
   cells/mu L or an AIDS defining event (ADE). Multivariable Poisson
   regression models were used to estimate both prevalence ratios (PR) for
   the association of potential risk factors with LP and Incidence rate
   ratios (IRRs) for its impact on the development of the composite
   endpoint (first ADE, first serious non-AIDS event {[}SNAE] or overall
   mortality).
   Results
   14,876 individuals were included. Overall, LP prevalence in 2004-2018
   was 44.6\%. Risk factors for LP included older age, having been infected
   through injection drug use or heterosexual intercourse, low educational
   level and originating from non-European countries. LP was associated
   with an increased risk of the composite endpoint (IRR: 1.34; 95\%CI
   1.20, 1.50), ADE (1.39; 1.18, 1.64), SNAE (1.22; 1.01, 1.47) and
   mortality (1.71; 1.41, 2.08).
   Conclusions
   LP remains a health problem in Spain, mainly among certain populations,
   and is associated with greater morbidity and mortality. Public policies
   should be implemented to expand screening and early diagnosis of HIV
   infection, for a focus on those at greatest risk of LP.}},

   (IPTp) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) decreases placental
   parasitaemia, thus improving birth outcomes. Zambian policy recommends
   monthly SP-IPTp doses given presumptively during pregnancy at each
   antenatal examination, spaced one month apart after 16 weeks of
   gestation. The effectiveness of SP-IPTp was evaluated in Zambia where a
   recent study showed moderate prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum
   parasites with genetic mutations that confer SP resistance.
   Methods: HIV-negative women were enrolled at the time of delivery at two
   facilities in Mansa, Zambia, an area of high malaria transmission. Women
   were interviewed and SP exposure was determined by antenatal card
   documentation or self-reports. Using Poisson regression modelling, the
   effectiveness of SP-IPTp was evaluated for outcomes of parasitaemia
   (microscopic examination of maternal peripheral, cord, and placental
   blood films), maternal anaemia (Hb < 11 g/dl), placental infection
   (histopathology), and infant outcomes (low birth weight (LBW), preterm
   delivery, and small for gestational age) in women who took 0-4 doses of
   SP-IPTp.
   Results: Participants included 435 women, with a median age of 23 years
   (range 16-44). Thirty-four women took zero doses of SP-IPTp, while 115,
   142 and 144 women took one, two, or >= three doses, respectively.
   Multivariate Poisson regression models considering age, mosquito net
   usage, indoor residual spraying, urban home, gravidity, facility, wet
   season delivery, and marital status showed that among paucigravid women
   >= two doses of SP-ITPp compared to one or less doses was associated
   with a protective effect on LBW (prevalence ratio (PR) 0.33, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.91) and any infection (PR 0.76, CI
   0.58-0.99). Multivariate models considering SP-IPTp as a continuous
   variable showed a protective dose-response association with LBW
   (paucigravid women: PR 0.54, CI 0.33-0.90, multigravid women: PR 0.63,
   CI 0.41-0.97).
   Conclusions: In Mansa, Zambia, an area of moderate SP resistance, >= two
   doses of SP-IPTp were associated with a protective effect from malaria
   in pregnancy, especially among paucigravid women. Each dose of SP-IPTp
   contributed to a 46 and 37\% decrease in the frequency of LBW among
   paucigravid and multigravid women, respectively. SP-IPTp remains a
   viable strategy in this context.}},

Title = {{The relationship between nurse staffing and patient outcomes: A case

Volume = {{46}},

Pages = {{986-992}},

Abstract = {{Background: Research has shown a direct relationship between staffing
   levels and patient outcomes for specific nurse-sensitive indicators,
   with lower patient to nurse ratios (i.e. less patients per nurse)
   associated with better outcomes.
   Objectives: To explore the relationship between nurse staffing
   characteristics (the nursing hours worked by permanent and temporary
   staff and nurse hours per patient day) and patient outcomes: pressure
   sores, patient falls, upper gastrointestinal bleed, pneumonia, sepsis,
   shock and deep vein thrombosis.
   Design: A case study using retrospective hospital data, at ward level.
   Setting: A tertiary cardio-respiratory NHS Trust in England, comprising
   two hospitals.
   Participants: All patients, including day cases, who were admitted to
   either hospital as an in-patient over 12 months.
   Methods: Data were extracted from corporate hospital systems. The
   clinical areas were categorised as lower dependency, i.e. wards, or
   critical care which included ICU and high dependency units. The
   relationship between nurse staffing characteristics and patient outcomes
   was assessed using either a Poisson or negative binomial regression
   model as appropriate. We sought to establish whether the outcomes were
   affected by the nurse hours per patient day, the permanent nurse hours
   worked as a percentage of the total hours, and the permanent nurse hours
   worked as a percentage of the permanent and bank hours combined.
   Results: In the lower dependency category wards there was only a weak
   association demonstrated between nurse staffing and the majority of the
   outcomes. The results from the high dependency critical care areas
   showed few significant results with only the rate of sepsis being
   significantly reduced as the ratio of permanent staff hours increased.
   Conclusions: The study demonstrated the possibility of using existing
   hospital data to examine the relationship between nurse staffing and
   patient outcomes, however the associations found were weak and did not
   replicate reliably the findings from previous work. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Lattice structures have been widely studied due to their advantage of
   low stiffness-to-weight ratio or sometimes auxetic properties. This
   paper presents a topology optimization method for structures with
   functionally-graded infill lattices with buckling constraints, which
   minimizes compliance while ensuring a prescribed level of structural
   stability against buckling failures. To realize topologically-optimized
   structures filled with functionally-graded lattices, Helmholtz
   PDE-filter with a variable radius is applied on the density field in
   Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method. Buckling load
   factors based on the linear buckling analysis is employed as buckling
   constraints. Numerical examples show that proposed method can generate
   stiff structures comparable to the ones by the SIMP, with
   functionally-graded infill lattices that improve the structural
   stability by avoiding long, slender features under compression. (C) 2019

Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{560-569}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cellular materials are known to have two properties; structures and
   mechanisms. Therefore, one may design structures with cellular materials
   while controlling stiffness and flexibility depending on the struts'
   connectivity. The objectives of this study are to investigate in-plane
   flexible properties of bending dominated cellular materials under
   macroscopic deformation and to secure a method to design a passive
   morphing airfoil with flexible cellular cores. The airfoil with three
   cellular cores (chiral, regular and re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs) is
   investigated under a static load through the deformation gradient of the
   cellular cores under an aerostatic load. The structural performance of
   the airfoil with the designed compliant cellular cores is validated
   through the fluid structure interaction through which a structural
   finite element analysis is combined with fluid statics. Considering the
   deformation of the airfoil with flexible cellular cores under an
   aerostatic load, shear is the dominant deformation mode of the cores of
   the airfoil. The re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb core shows the highest
   flexibility in shear and causes a lower stress in local cell walls in
   shear than the other cellular cores when the cellular mesostructures are
   designed to have the same shear modulus. This implies that the
   re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb core has the potential to be used as a
   structure with a passive morphing airfoil. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the problem of uniformly loaded bars in
   strain gradient elasticity. We study the deformation of an isotropic
   chiral bar subjected to body forces, to tractions on the lateral surface
   and to resultant forces and moments on the ends. Examples of chiral
   materials include some auxetic materials, bones, some honeycomb
   structures, as well as composites with inclusions. The three-dimensional
   problem is reduced to the study of some generalized plane strain
   problems. The method is used to study the deformation of a uniformly
   loaded circular cylinder. New chiral effects are presented. The flexure
   of a chiral cylinder, in contrast with the case of achiral materials, is
   accompanied by extension and bending. The salient feature of the
   solution is that a uniform pressure acting on the lateral surface of a
   chiral circular elastic cylinder produces a twist around its axis. (C)

Abstract = {{Integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity
   (GARCH) models have played an important role in time series analysis of

   to the existing models. In this paper, we study a local influence
   diagnostic analysis in the log-linear integer-valued GARCH models. The
   slope-based diagnostic and stepwise curvature-based diagnostics in a
   framework of the modified likelihood displacement are proposed. Under
   five perturbation schemes the corresponding local influence measures are
   derived. Two simulated data sets and a real-world example are analyzed
   to illustrate our method. In addition, the fitted model for this example
   has a negative coefficient for one of the two covariates, which is
   particularly illustrative of the extra flexibility of the considered

Title = {{Racial Disparities in Sexual Assault Characteristics and Mental Health
   Care After Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Exams}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background: Sexual assault (SA) is common, but Black individuals might
   be at higher risk of SA and negative health sequalae. Racial differences
   in SA characteristics and health care utilization after SA are largely
   unknown.
   Materials and Methods: We reviewed medical records of 690 individuals
   (23.9\% Black; 93.6\% women) who received a SA medical forensic exam
   (SAMFE) at a southeastern U.S. hospital. We examined bivariate racial
   differences in SA characteristics and used zero-inflated Poisson
   regressions to estimate racial differences in mental health outpatient
   visits at the SAMFE hospital.
   Results: Among survivors of SA, Black survivors were more likely than
   White survivors to have been victimized by an intimate partner (odds
   ratio {[}OR] = 1.77, confidence interval {[}95\% CI] = 1.02-3.07) and
   they had more post-SA outpatient mental health visits at the SAMFE
   hospital (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] = 2.05, 95\% CI = 1.70-2.47).
   Black survivors were less likely to report alcohol or drug use before
   the SA (OR = 0.42, 95\% CI = 0.28-0.62). In multivariable models, Black
   survivors trended toward more mental health visits than White survivors
   (IRR = 1.63, 95\% CI = 0.82-2.44), but intimate partner violence (IPV)
   significantly moderated that association (IRR = 0.01, 95\%CI = <=
   0.001-0.03). Black survivors assaulted by an intimate partner were less
   likely to access mental health care than White IPV survivors.
   Conclusions: The hospital setting of a SAMFE could be a unique
   opportunity to serve Black survivors and reduce racial disparities in

Abstract = {{Background: The association between physician-directed goals of care
   discussions (GOCDs) and the use of aggressive interventions in
   terminally ill patients has not been well characterized in the
   literature. We examined the associations between the timing of
   physician-directed GOCDs in terminally ill patients and the use of
   aggressive interventions, probability of dying in the inpatient setting,
   and intensive care unit (ICU) utilization.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients admitted to
   our urban community hospital in 2015 who had a terminal diagnosis on
   admission and either died on an inpatient unit or were discharged to
   hospice. The primary independent variable was the number of days from
   admission to GOCD, expressed as a proportion of the patient's length of
   stay (LOS). We used robust variance Poisson and zero-inflated negative
   binomial regression, as appropriate, to estimate the associations
   between goals of care timing and risk of having an intervention, risk of
   dying in the inpatient setting, odds of ICU admission, and ICU LOS.
   Results: A total of 197 cases were included. After adjusting for age,
   language, gender, insurance, dementia, and decision maker (patient
   versus surrogate decision maker), later GOCD was significantly
   associated with greater risk of having an aggressive intervention (risk
   ratio {[}RR] = 1.04, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.02-1.06),
   greater risk of death as an inpatient (RR = 1.04, 95\% CI = 1.02-1.06),
   and greater odds of ICU admission (odds ratio = 1.19, 95\% CI =
   1.02-1.39).
   Conclusion: Later GOCDs were associated with greater risk of aggressive
   interventions and death as an inpatient and greater odds of ICU
   admission. Goals of care discussion should be done routinely and early
   during the hospitalization of terminally ill patients.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background In response to increasing HIV and other sexually
   transmissible infection (HIV/STI) notifications in Australia, a social
   marketing campaign Drama Downunder (DDU) was launched in 2008 to promote
   HIV/STI testing among men who have sex with men (MSM). We analyzed
   prospective data from (1) an online cohort of MSM and (2) clinic-level
   HIV/STI testing to evaluate the impact of DDU on HIV, syphilis,
   gonorrhea, and chlamydia testing.
   Materials and Methods (1) Cohort participants who completed 3 surveys
   (2010-2014) contributed to a Poisson regression model examining
   predictors of recent HIV testing. (2) HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and
   chlamydia tests among MSM attending high caseload primary care clinics
   (2007-2013) were included in an interrupted time series analysis.
   Results (1) Although campaign awareness was high among 242 MSM
   completing 726 prospective surveys, campaign recall was not associated
   with self-reported HIV testing. Reporting previous regular HIV testing
   (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 2.4; 95\% confidence interval, 1.3-4.4)
   and more than 10 partners in the previous 6 months (adjusted incidence
   rate ratio, 1.2; 95\% confidence interval, 1.1-1.4) was associated with
   recent HIV testing. (2) Analysis of 257,023 tests showed increasing
   monthly HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia tests pre-DDU. Post-DDU,
   gonorrhea test rates increased significantly among HIV-negative MSM,
   with modest and nonsignificant increasing rates of HIV, syphilis, and
   chlamydia testing. Among HIV-positive MSM, no change in gonorrhea or
   chlamydia testing occurred and syphilis testing declined significantly.
   Conclusions Increasing HIV/STI testing trends among MSM occurred pre-
   and post-DDU, coinciding with other plausible drivers of testing. Modest
   changes in HIV testing post-DDU suggest that structural changes to
   improve testing access may need to occur alongside health promotion to
   increase testing frequency.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials offer exotic properties based on local control
   of cell geometry and their global configuration into structures and
   mechanisms. Historically, these have been made as continuous, monolithic
   structures with additive manufacturing, which affords high resolution
   and throughput, but is inherently limited by process and machine
   constraints. To address this issue, we present a construction system for
   mechanical metamaterials based on discrete assembly of a finite set of
   parts, which can be spatially composed for a range of properties such as
   rigidity, compliance, chirality, and auxetic behavior. This system
   achieves desired continuum properties through design of the parts such
   that global behavior is governed by local mechanisms. We describe the
   design methodology, production process, numerical modeling, and
   experimental characterization of metamaterial behaviors. This approach
   benefits from incremental assembly, which eliminates scale limitations,
   best-practice manufacturing for reliable, low-cost part production, and
   interchangeability through a consistent assembly process across part
   types.}},

Abstract = {{The presence and abundance of standing dead trees (SDTs) in forests is
   typically characterized by an excess number of zeros and high variation.
   The variability inherent in SDT data naturally leads to the assessment
   of novel quantitative methods to represent SDT populations and their
   role in contributing to forest ecosystem structure. This analysis
   assessed the performance of count regression methods fit with Bayesian
   mixed-effects models that estimate SDTs (all dead trees with a diameter
   at breast height >= 12.7 cm found on plots 0.07-ha in size) on over
   17,000 forest inventory plots across the US Lake States (Michigan,
   Minnesota, and Wisconsin). Random effects models that used the
   independent variables basal area, mean annual temperature, and plot
   ownership (i.e., publicly- or privately-owned) as fixed effects and
   forest type as a random effect outperformed a method which used
   fixed-effects, alone. Standard and zero-inflated negative binomial
   models were effective in accounting for overdispersion present in the
   data (variance/mean ratio for SDT counts was 72.6), whereas Poisson
   count models were not. Random effects were calibrated on a new
   population of SDTs. Employing informative prior distributions from the
   developed model led to improved estimates of SDT abundance by reducing
   root mean square error by seven percent. This analysis highlights an
   approach that uses existing models for representing population averages
   while calibrating their local random effects with new data to arrive at
   improved estimates of SDTs across the region.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research was to design, fabricate, and test coronary
   stent designs composed of carbon-infiltrated carbon nanotubes (CI-CNTs).
   Coronary stents currently have two major complications: restenosis and
   thrombosis. CI-CNT stents may provide improved clinical outcomes for
   both of these issues. Multiple stent design concepts were generated,
   evaluated, and two stent designs were selected: one with a semi-auxetic
   nature, and one designed for maximum force. These designs were further
   developed and optimized using analytical tools along with finite element
   analysis. Planar versions of the stent designs were manufactured and
   mechanically tested to verify performance. The performance of the
   cylindrical stent configurations was analyzed using finite element
   modeling. A sample cylindrical stent was also fabricated. This research
   demonstrates that feasible coronary stent designs can be manufactured
   from CI-CNTs. However, a major challenge for CI-CNT stent designs is
   meeting the design requirement of sufficient radial force.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates impact damage detection in a composite sandwich
   panel. The panel is built from a chiral honeycomb and two composite
   skins. Chiral structures are a subset of auxetic solids exhibiting
   counterintuitive deformation mechanism and rotative - but not reflective
   - symmetry. Damage detection is performed using nonlinear
   acoustics,involves combined vibroacoustic interaction of high-frequency
   ultrasonic wave and low-frequency vibration excitation. High- and
   low-frequency excitations are introduced to the panel using a
   low-profile piezoceramic transducer and an electromagnetic shaker,
   respectively. Vibro-acoustic modulated responses are measured using
   laser vibrometry. The methods used for impact damage detection clearly
   reveal debonding in the composite panel. The high-frequency ``weak{''}
   ultrasonic wave is also modulated by the low-frequency ``strong{''}
   vibration wave when nonlinear acoustics is used for damage detection. As
   a result frequency sidebands can be observed around the main acoustic
   harmonic in the spectrum of the ultrasonic signal.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The goal of this study was to analyze trends in the annual
   rates of reported medical outcomes of US copperhead (Agkistrodon
   contortrix) snakebites published in the annual reports of the American
   Association of Poison Control Centers in the course of 26 years.
   Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of medical outcomes for
   copperhead snakebite victims who developed fatal, major, moderate,
   minor, or no effects. The annual rates for these medical outcomes were
   calculated by dividing the annual number of patients in each outcome
   category by the total annual number of people reported as being bitten
   by copperheads. Poisson and negative binomial regression were used to
   examine trends in annual rates.
   Results: From 1983 through 2008, the incidence rate of copperhead
   snakebites causing no effect significantly decreased by 12.1\%/year
   (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] 0.879; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   0.848-0.911]. From 1985 through 2008, the incidence rate of minor
   outcomes significantly decreased by 2.3\%/year (IRR 0.977; 95\% CI
   0.972-0.981), whereas the rate of moderate outcomes significantly
   increased by 2.8\%/year (IRR 1.028; 95\% CI 1.024-1.033). The rate of
   major outcomes did not significantly change. One fatality was reported
   in 2001.
   Conclusions: Annual rates of copperhead snakebites producing no effects
   and minor outcomes significantly decreased, those producing moderate
   outcomes significantly increased, and those producing major outcomes did
   not significantly change in a 26-year period.}},

Abstract = {{The COVID-19 lockdown was imposed in a context of notable inequalities
   in the distribution of the social determinants of health. It is possible
   that the housing conditions in which children and their families
   experienced the confinement, and the adoption of healthy behaviors, may
   have followed unequal patterns. The aim was to describe social
   inequalities in housing conditions and in health-related behaviors among
   children during the lockdown in Spain. This cross-sectional study was
   based on data from an online survey collecting information on the child
   population (3-12 years) living in Spain (n = 10,765). The outcome
   variables used were several housing conditions and health-related
   behaviors. The socioeconomic variables used were financial difficulties
   and parents' educational level. Crude prevalence and prevalence ratios
   estimated using Poisson models were calculated. During lockdown,
   children from families with low educational levels and financial
   difficulties not only tended to live in poor housing conditions, but
   were also exposed to negative health determinants such as noise and
   tobacco smoke; they took less physical exercise, had a poorer diet,
   spent more time in front of screens and had less social contact. A
   notable social gradient was found in most of the variables analyzed. The
   results point to the need to incorporate the perspective of equity in
   the adoption of policies in order to avoid the increase of pre-existing
   social inequalities in the context of a pandemic.}},

Abstract = {{Non-Hodgkin lymphoma arising in the context of immunosuppression is an
   important adverse outcome after solid organ transplantation. Diffuse
   large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most commonly diagnosed subtype of
   post-transplantation non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but few studies of transplant
   recipients have examined subtype-specific risks. Therefore, we examined
   DLBCL risk in the Transplant Cancer Match Study, including
   registry-based cancer ascertainment among 96,615 solid organ transplants
   performed from 2000 to 2008. We determined standardized incidence ratios
   (SIRs) and 95\% confidence intervals comparing DLBCL risk in transplant
   recipients with that in the general population, and used multivariable
   Poisson regression models to assess the impact of potential risk
   factors. We identified 321 incident cases of DLBCL, over 12 times more
   than expected based on general population rates (SIR = 12.6, 95\%
   confidence interval = 11.2-14.0). SIRs were highest in young recipients
   and those receiving a lung or pancreas/kidney-pancreas transplant, and
   were greatly elevated for extranodal DLBCLs at the site of the
   transplantation compared with other sites. DLBCL risk was highest in the
   first year following transplantation, and SIRs for early-onset DLBCL
   risk were elevated in association with Epstein-Barr virus-negative
   serostatus and use of polyclonal antibody induction therapy. In
   conclusion, associations between recipient and transplant factors and
   post-transplantation DLBCL risk suggest a complicated interrelationship
   among multiple risk factors and timing of disease. (C) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore lip cancer (LC) associations with work
   environmental exposures in a record-linkage study of Norwegian farmers.
   We hypothesize immunosuppressive substances (e.g. mycotoxins,
   pesticides) to influence LC incidence.
   Methods: A cohort of 131,243 male Norwegian farmers born 1925-1971 was
   established by cross-linkage of national registers and followed up
   through 1999 for incident LC, (ICD-7 site 140) in the Cancer Registry of
   Norway. Farm production data from agricultural censuses 1969-1979 and
   meteorological data on solar radiation and fungal forecasts (events of
   wet and temperate conditions known to favour fungal growth and mycotoxin
   formation) served as exposure proxies. Adjusted rate ratios (RR) and
   95\% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Poisson regression.
   Results: We identified 108 LC cases (rate 4.4 per 100,000 person-years).
   We found LC to be moderately associated with horses on the farm (RR =
   1.6, CI = 1.0-2.4), construction work employment (RR = 1.7, CI =
   1.1-2.6), pesticide use (RR = 0.7, CI = 0.4-1.0), grain production (RR =
   1.3, CI = 0.9-2.1) and increasing levels of fungal forecasts (RR = 1.6,
   CI = 0.92.8 in the highest two quartiles).
   Conclusion: Moderate associations of LC with grain production and fungal

Abstract = {{Background: Hormonal contraceptives have been associated with increased
   risk of HIV acquisition.
   Methods: The association between hormonal contraception use and HIV
   acquisition was assessed in a rural community-based cohort in Rakai
   District, Uganda. A group of 5117 sexually active HIV-negative women
   were surveyed at 10 month intervals between 1994 and 1999. Information
   on demographic and sociobehavioral characteristics, use of hormonal
   contraception (pill and injectable methods), condoms and the number of
   sexual partners was obtained by home-based interview. HIV incidence rate
   ratios (IRR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) associated with hormonal
   contraception were estimated by multivariate Poisson regression after
   adjustment for age, condom use, number of sexual partners, marital
   status, education and history of genital ulcer disease.
   Results: At one or more interviews, 16.6\% of women reported use of
   hormonal contraceptives and 23.0\% reported condom use. HIV incidence
   was 2.3/100 person-years in hormonal contraceptive users compared with
   1.5/100 person-years in non-hormonal contraceptive users (unadjusted
   IRR, 1.56; 95\% CI, 1.00-2.33). After multivariate adjustment, the IRR
   associated with hormonal contraceptives was reduced to 0.94 (95\% CI,
   0.53-1.64). The adjusted IRR was 1.12 (95\% CI, 0.48-2.56) with oral
   contraceptive use and 0.84 (95\% CI, 0.41-1.72) with injectable methods.
   Conclusion: Use of hormonal contraception is not associated with HIV
   acquisition after adjustment for behavioral confounding. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Background/Aim: Tic habit cough (THC) is not easily recognized and
   requires a high index of suspicion. Since there is evidence for
   stress-related etiology, the study presents our experience during the
   eight-year period of the recent Greek financial crisis. Patients and
   Methods: This is a descriptive prospective cross-sectional clinical
   study using a consistent approach to diagnosis, possible triggers and
   treatment options. Results: Fifty-one children (26 girls, age 9.5 +/-
   3.1y) from a total of 3,793 new referrals for chronic cough fulfilled
   the criteria of THC (1.34\%). Incidence rates per 1,000 person-years
   were 1.34 (95\%CI=0.34-5.40), 3.91 (95\%CI=1.86-8.19), 4.03
   (95\%CI=2.01-8.06) and 14.60 (95\%CI=10.43-20.44) for every two years.
   Poisson analysis showed an increased trend during the four time periods
   with an incidence rate ratio equal to 2.21 (95\%CI=1.58-3.09, p<0.001).
   THC was mainly attributed to learning difficulties, as well as
   stress-related impact of peer or family bullying, family financial
   problems and child anxiety disorders. Conclusion: The incidence of THC
   is associated with the negative aspects of stressors during a period of
   financial crisis. The potential underlining psycho-physiological
   mechanisms are discussed as well as the fact that prompt diagnosis may
   result in successful interventions.}},

Title = {{Frame Structure and Engineering Applications of the Multisource System
   Cloud Service Platform of Monitoring of the Soft Rock Tunnel}},
Journal = {{GEOFLUIDS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{2021}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Throughout engineering construction, large deformation disasters in soft
   rock tunnels are encountered increasingly frequently. Therefore,
   structural health monitoring not only ensures accurate construction
   management but also provides a basis for dynamic adjustment of the
   support structure. The existing monitoring technology has certain
   shortcomings, such as poor anti-interference ability, non-real-time
   operation, and great security risks. Consequently, high-precision
   real-time monitoring has become a key scientific issue in tunnel
   engineering. For this work, multisource information fusion technology
   was adopted, while data security reserve systems, such as cloud server
   (ECS) based on the fiber Bragg grating multisource sensing system, cloud
   database (RDS), and cloud website, were embedded into the No. 2 inclined
   shaft of the Muzhailing tunnel. Based on the negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) anchor cable control technology for large deformation of the soft
   rock in the No. 2 inclined shaft of the Muzhailing tunnel, reasonable
   and effective intelligent monitoring was carried out for tunnel
   construction. Monitoring and early warning cloud service platforms,
   based on the Internet of Things and cloud technology, could quickly
   produce query and statistic tunnel monitoring information. The
   monitoring system provided the collection, transmission, storage,
   processing, and early warning information sending of data, such as NPR
   anchor cable axial force, steel arch stress, deep surrounding rock
   displacement, surrounding rock deformation, and contact pressure between
   primary support with secondary lining. This monitoring system ensured
   construction safety and provided monitoring application case support for
   the related problems of similar projects.}},

Title = {{Canada-Wide Effect of Regulatory Warnings on Antidepressant Prescribing

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the impact of the Health Canada regulatory
   warnings regarding antidepressant (AD) prescribing on suicide rates in
   boys and girls under the age of 18 and aged 18 to 19 years in Canada
   between 2004 and 2009. We hypothesized that an increase in suicide rates
   would be specific to girls, reflecting higher AD prescribing rates in
   girls than boys.
   Method: We graphed and tested the difference between Canada-wide suicide
   rates before and after the regulatory warning periods (either from 1995
   to 2006 or from 1995 to 2009) in boys and girls under the age of 18 or
   aged 18 to 19 years. For comparison with prior studies, we estimated
   rate ratios and 95\% confidence intervals using either Poisson
   regression or negative binomial regression.
   Results: There was no statistically significant increase in suicide
   rates in girls under the age of 18, or aged 18 to 19 years in response
   to the AD regulatory warnings. In boys under the age of 18 or aged 18 to
   19 years, suicide rates declined after 2003.
   Conclusions: We did not find increased rates of suicide after the AD
   regulatory warnings in boys or girls under the age of 18 or aged 18 to
   19 years in Canada-wide rates. However, this does not rule out the
   possibility that such an effect occurred in some jurisdictions in girls
   and (or) the regulatory warnings prevented the trend toward declining
   suicide rates. Factors influencing the downward trend in boys merit
   further attention.}},

Abstract = {{The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region was sequenced in 37 sperm
   whales from a large part of the global range of the species. Nucleotide
   diversity was several-fold lower than that reported for control regions
   of abundant and outbred mammals, but similar to that for populations
   known to have experienced bottlenecks. Relative rate tests did not
   suggest that the low diversity is due to a lower substitution rate in
   sperm whale mtDNA. Rather, it is more likely that demographic factors
   have reduced diversity. The pattern of nucleotide substitutions was
   examined by cladistic methods, facilitated by the apparent monophyly of
   lineages from the Southern Hemisphere, as defined by a single base pair
   deletion. Substitutions were nonrandom in nature, confined to a few
   `'hot spots,'' and parallel substitutions constituted a majority of the
   inferred changes. The substitution pattern fitted a negative binomial
   distribution better than a Poisson distribution, and the bias in number
   of substitutions among sites was considerably higher than previously
   reported for the mtDNA control region of any species. A novel method of
   estimating time since common ancestry was developed, which utilizes the
   transition/transversion ratio R and the number of substitutions inferred
   from a parsimony analysis. Using this method, we estimated the age of
   sperm whale mtDNA diversity to be about 6,000-25,000 years, and when the
   uncertainty of R was accounted for, a range of about 1,000-100,000 years
   was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To investigate the factors associated with poor oral
   health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in a sample of Brazilian older
   adults.
   Methods and Results: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 535
   non-institutionalized elders aged 60 years or older from Piracicaba, Sao
   Paulo, Brazil. OHRQoL was measured using the Geriatric Oral Health
   Assessment Index (GOHAI). Data on sociodemographic characteristics,
   self-perceived general health status, and health-related behaviors were
   obtained through a structured questionnaire. Data on chronic diseases
   were obtained from health records. Associations between exploratory
   factors and low OHRQoL (\% GOHAI score <30) were evaluated using
   multivariate Poisson regression models to estimate adjusted prevalence
   ratios (PRs) and confidence intervals. The mean OHRQoL score was 30 (+/-
   4.4). In bivariate analysis, being not married, smoking, and self-rated
   ``fair/poor{''} general health status were associated with lower OHRQoL.
   In the adjusted model, self-rated ``fair/poor{''} general health (PR:
   1.25; 95\% CI: 1.05-1.48), presence of chronic diseases (PR: 1.88; 95\%
   CI: 1.37-2.58), smoking (PR: 1.25; 95\% CI: 1.02-1.53), and reason for
   last dental appointment (PR: 1.34; 95\% CI: 1.13-1.59) were associated
   with poor OHRQoL.
   Conclusion: Non-institutionalized older adults with a history of chronic
   diseases, who smoke, have a negative perception of their general health,
   and had the last dental appointment motivated by pain present
   significantly higher prevalence rates of poor OHRQoL.}},

Title = {{A completely in vitro ultrahigh-throughput droplet-based microfluidic
   screening system for protein engineering and directed evolution}},

Abstract = {{In vitro screening systems based on the coupled transcription and
   translation of genes using cell-free systems have a number of attractive
   features for protein engineering and directed evolution. We present a
   completely in vitro ultrahigh-throughput screening platform using
   droplet-based microfluidics. Single genes are compartmentalized in
   aqueous droplets, dispersed in inert carrier oil, and amplified using
   the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After amplification, the droplets,
   now containing 30 000 copies of each gene, are fused one-to-one with
   droplets containing a cell-free coupled transcription-translation (IVTT)
   system and the reagents for a fluorogenic assay. Fluorescence-activated
   electrocoalescence with an aqueous stream is then used to selectively
   recover genes from droplets containing the desired activity. We
   demonstrate, by selecting mixtures of lacZ genes encoding the enzyme
   beta-galactosidase and lacZmut genes encoding an inactive variant, that
   this system can sort at 2000 droplets s(-1): lacZ genes were enriched
   502-fold from a 1 : 100 molar ratio of lacZ : lacZmut genes. Indeed, the
   false positive and false negative error rates were both < 0.004 and the
   results indicate that enrichment is not limited by the sorting
   efficiency, but by the co-encapsulation of multiple genes in droplets,
   which is described by the Poisson distribution. Compared to screening
   using microtiter plate-based systems, the volume and cost of PCR and
   IVTT reagents are reduced by almost 10(5)-fold, allowing the screening
   of 10(6) genes using only 150 mu L of reagents.}},

Title = {{Effect of surface charges on the curvature moduli of a membrane}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{5, 1}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The modificatior, of the curvature moduli due to surface charges in
   lipid bilayers is analyzed using the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann
   equation for the relationship between the charge density and surface
   potential. An expansion in a small parameter epsilon, which is the ratio
   of the Debye length and the radius of curvature, is used. At low charge
   densities, previous results obtained from the Debye-Huckel approximation
   are recovered. At high charge densities, the corrections to the mean and
   Gaussian curvature approach constant values. The total energy of
   curvature for a symmetrically charged membrane becomes negative when the
   charge density is increased beyond a critical value, indicating that the
   membrane spontaneously forms vesicles. An asymmetry in the charge
   densities on the two monolayers that form the bilayer results in a
   spontaneous curvature, and the radius of curvature could be large
   compared to the Debye length when the asymmetry is small. The case of
   adsorbed charges is also considered, where there is a reduction in the
   chemical energy when a charge is adsorbed on the surface. At low charge
   density, the mean and Gaussian curvature are equal in magnitude and
   opposite in sign to that for fixed charges, while at high charge
   density, the mean and Gaussian curvature approach values identical to
   that for a surface with fixed charges. Numerical calculations of the
   change in the curvature moduli with realistic parameter values indicate
   that these effects are likely to be of importance in the spontaneous
   formation of vesicles.}},

Abstract = {{The Muzhailing extra-long highway tunnel and corresponding inclined
   shafts in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China passes through structurally
   complex carbonaceous slate that is under high ground stress.
   Rationally-designed and effective support is of high importance for
   achieving safe and efficient tunnel construction. The No. 2 inclined
   shaft of Muzhailing Tunnel was taken as the engineering background
   prototype, for which, a similar model test was conducted to evaluate the
   effect of highly pre-tightened constant resistance (NPR, Negative
   Poisson's Ratio) anchor cable support provision to the geologically
   complex carbonaceous slate at different depths. Two schemes were
   proposed during testing: one scheme was without support and the second
   was with asymmetric support from highly pre-tightened constant
   resistance anchor cable. Digital speckle displacement analysis system
   and micro-ground-stress sensors were employed to measure the deformation
   and shear stress distribution of the tunnel. The results demonstrated
   that through the second support scheme, the deformation of the
   surrounding rock could be effectively ameliorated, while this support
   scheme was applied on the project site of the No.2 inclined shaft, to
   explore the rationality of the scheme through field engineering tests.
   On-site monitoring indicated that the deformation of the surrounding
   rock was within the reasonable design range and the problem of severe
   tunnel deformation was effectively controlled. The research methods and
   related conclusions can be used as a reference for the treatment of
   large deformation problems in deep-buried soft rock tunnels.}},

   phosphorene under uniaxial and isotropic strains}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{45}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical and electronic properties of both the monolayer and
   bilayer phosphorenes under either isotropic or uniaxial strain have been
   systematically investigated using first-principles calculations. It is
   interesting to find that: 1) Under a large enough isotropic tensile
   strain, the monolayer phosphorene would lose its pucker structure and
   transform into a flat hexagonal plane, while two inner sublayers of the
   bilayer phosphorene could be bonded due to its interlayer distance
   contraction. 2) Under the uniaxial tensile strain along a zigzag
   direction, the pucker distance of each layer in the bilayer phosphorene
   can exhibit a specific negative Poisson's ratio. 3) The electronic
   properties of both the monolayer and bilayer phosphorenes are sensitive
   to the magnitude and direction of the applied strains. Their band gaps
   decrease more rapidly under isotropic compressive strain than under
   uniaxial strain. Also, their direct-indirect band gap transitions happen
   at the larger isotropic tensile strains compared with that under
   uniaxial strain. 4) Under the isotropic compressive strain, the bilayer
   phosphorene exhibits a transition from a direct-gap semiconductor to a
   metal. In contrast, the monolayer phosphorene initially has the
   direct-indirect transition and then transitions to a metal. However,
   under isotropic tensile strain, both the bilayer and monolayer
   phosphorene show the direct-indirect transition and, finally, the
   transition to a metal. Our numerical results may open new potential
   applications of phosphorene in nanoelectronics and nanomechanical
   devices by external isotropic strain or uniaxial strain along different
   directions.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the configuration of gel sheets with centrosymmetric
   distribution of monomer concentration in this paper. The configuration
   energy of these gel sheets consists of the in-plane stretching energy
   and bending energy. The equilibrium shape equations are derived by
   variation principle. This provides a way to control the shape of gel
   sheets by the initial concentration and thickness. From the equilibrium
   shape equations, we know that the Gaussian curvature on boundary (K|C)
   of equilibrium shape is determined by the Poisson ratio (v) over cap.
   K|C is negative when (v) over cap > 0 but positive when (v) over cap <
   0. Specially, we derive two dome-like solutions from the equilibrium
   shape equations to compare with the experimental data. In these
   dome-like sheets, on the boundary part the Gaussian curvature is K < 0,
   which is different from the center part (K > 0). Furthermore, we deduce
   that the initial gel distribution of cylinder sheets is proportional to
   1/r and find that N-isopropylacrylamide cylinder sheets cannot be formed
   without additional edges. Our theoretical results agree well with the
   experimental data {[}Klein et al., Science 315, 1116 (2007)]. On the
   other hand, we predict a special type of gel sheets as minimal surface.
   Their residual stresses are constant and same along radial and
   circumference directions. For axisymmetric sheets, we give a criterion
   about the sign of Gaussian curvature K when thickness h is infinite
   small.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes hospitalized injuries among workers in British

   occurrence, or a payment field, which can identify workers compensation
   agency. Poisson regression models were used to analyze differences in
   hospitalization rates across race, job category, age group, and calendar
   year. The crude and adjusted rate ratios were calculated along with the
   95\% confidence intervals (CIs). During the follow-up period, there were
   164 work related hospitalization resulting in a rate for work-related
   hospitalization of 5.38 per 1,000 person years. The higher rates by
   nature of injury were for dislocation, sprains \& strains, open wounds,
   and fracture of upper limbs. During the study period, the higher rates
   of injury by causes were machinery related, falls, and struck against.
   In the multivariate models, there were no statistically significant
   relationship of injury risk with age and race. In respect to occupation,
   compared to foremen/supervisor, other sawmills' workers did not have
   significantly elevated risk of injury. The trend analyses found a
   significant negative trend (P = 0.004) of injury risk over the whole

Abstract = {{This study investigates the impact of reproductive factors on the
   association between education and breast cancer mortality in Belgium.
   The role of reproductive factors has been investigated in several
   studies, with mixed results. Reproductive factors are either completely
   or partially responsible for the association between education and
   breast cancer mortality. The data consist of the 1991 census linked to
   registration data on cause-specific mortality during the period
   19911995, including all breast cancer deaths in Belgium during the
   observation period. The study population includes all women aged 3579 at
   time of the census. Age-standardized mortality rates and mortality rate
   ratios (Poisson regression) are computed for educational groups with and
   without control for reproductive factors. The population is stratified
   according to age (women aged 3549 and 5079) and according to
   nulliparity. The relationship between education and breast cancer is
   significant among postmenopausal women. Breast cancer mortality is
   higher among the higher educated women. These results are consistent
   with international findings, the gradient not being negative as in most
   other causes of death, but positive. Statistical control for parity and
   age at first birth reduces the association largely. In addition, among
   nonparous women, differences in breast cancer mortality by education are
   not consistent and generally not significant. Reproductive factors are
   largely responsible for the positive association between education and
   breast cancer mortality among postmenopausal women in Belgium. Among
   premenopausal women, the relation is not significant, a pattern
   consistent with international studies.}},

Abstract = {{An important component of any CO2 sequestration project is seismic
   monitoring for tracking changes in subsurface physical properties such
   as velocity and density. Reservoir conditions and CO2 injection
   quantities govern whether such changes may be observable as a function
   of time. Here we investigate surface seismic response to CO2 injection
   at the Ketzin site, the first European onshore CO2 sequestration pilot
   study dealing with research on geological storage of CO2. First, a
   rock-physics model was built to evaluate the effect of injected CO2 on
   the seismic velocity. On the basis of this model, the seismic response
   for different CO2 injection geometries and saturation was studied using
   1D elastic modeling and 2D acoustic finite difference modeling.
   Rock-physics models show that CO2 injected in a gaseous state, rather
   than in a supercritical state, will have a more pronounced effect on
   seismic velocity, resulting in a stronger CO2 response. However,
   reservoir heterogeneity and seismic resolution, as well as random and
   coherent seismic noise, are negative factors that need to be considered
   in a seismic monitoring program. In spite of these potential
   difficulties, our seismic modeling results indicate that the CO2 seismic
   response should be strong enough to allow tracking on surface seismic
   data. Amplitude-related attributes (i.e., acoustic impedance versus
   Poisson's ratio cross-plots) and time-shift measurements are shown to be
   suitable methods for CO2 monitoring. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this Study, the improvisation on mix design and the analysis of the
   strength of rubberized concrete is carried out. The carbon fiber is cut
   in the prescribed ratio and used for the partial replacement of coarse
   aggregates. The carbon fibers were mixed with the concrete to form a
   Rubberized concrete. To obtain a rubberized concrete mixture, all mix
   design parameters were kept constant as given by the IS-456 method
   except for the coarse aggregate constituents. The coarse aggregate of
   the concrete was replaced by 5\%, 10\%, 15\%, 20\% and 25\% of its
   weight. The fine aggregate was sieved using 2.36 mm in order to pass
   through the holes of the carbon fiber to make a strong contact with the
   cement matrix.
   From some experimental results of compressive strength testing it was
   observed that both plain and rubberized concrete developing similar
   strength over the curing period as expected. For all concrete mixtures,
   the rate of compressive strength developed was high between 7 and 14
   days and slow between 14 and 28 days. Also, it was noted that
   irrespective of the curing period, there was a systematic reduction in
   compressive strength with increasing rubber content of the composite.
   Some experimental investigations observed that a high percentage of
   carbon fiber mixed cylinders took a longer time to crackdown because of
   the elastic nature of the fibers when bearing the loading. Moreover, it
   was observed that the above said rubberized concrete did not exhibit
   brittle failure under compression or split tension. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {{ObjectiveThe cognitive model (Hirsch \& Mathews, 2012) and attentional
   control theory (Eysenck \& Derakshan, 2011) postulate that compromised
   executive function (EF) and other cognitive constructs are negatively
   linked to increased excessive and uncontrollable worry, the core symptom
   of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, the prospective link
   between neuropsychological constructs and GAD are not well
   understood.MethodsA nationally representative sample of 2605
   community-dwelling adults whose average age was 55.20 (s.d. = 11.41,
   range 33-84; 56.31\% females) participated at baseline and 9-year
   follow-up. Baseline neuropsychological function and symptoms were
   measured using the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone and
   Composite International Diagnostic Interview - Short Form. Multivariate
   Poisson and negative binomial regression analyses were conducted with 11
   baseline covariates entered simultaneously: age, gender, years of formal
   education, perceived control, hypertension/diabetes, body mass index,
   exercise status, as well as GAD severity, panic disorder severity, and
   depression severity. Those with baseline GAD were also
   removed.ResultsLower Time 1 composite global cognition z-score
   independently predicted higher Time 2 GAD severity and diagnosis {[}odds
   ratio (OR) 0.60, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.40-0.89, p = 0.01].
   Poor inhibition, set-shifting, working memory (WM) updating, inductive
   reasoning, and global cognition sequentially forecasted heightened GAD.
   However, processing speed, verbal WM, verbal fluency, and episodic
   memory did not predict future GAD.ConclusionGlobal cognition, inductive
   reasoning, inhibition, set-shifting, and WM updating EF impairments may
   be distal risk factors for elevated GAD nearly a decade later.}},

Title = {{Metabolic syndrome and severe periodontitis were associated in Thai
   adults: A cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PERIODONTOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Background Studies support the relationship between metabolic syndrome
   (MetS) and periodontitis. However, age is the major confounding factor
   for both conditions. Therefore, this cross-sectional study was performed
   to investigate the relationship between MetS and severe periodontitis in
   different Thai adult age groups.
   Methods Data on the medical history, medical examination, and full mouth
   oral examination of 5,690 Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
   employees aged 25 to 77 years were collected. The prevalence ratio (PR)
   between risk variables, MetS, and periodontitis was determined using
   Poisson regression analysis. Moreover, the subgroup analysis and effect
   modification by age on severe periodontitis were performed.
   Results Overall, MetS was significantly associated with severe
   periodontitis compared with non-severe periodontitis (adjusted PR, 1.11;
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.01 to 1.13). The association was
   modified by age, with negative effect modification observed on the
   multiplicative and additive scales. The subgroup analysis revealed a
   significant relationship between MetS and severe periodontitis only in
   participants aged <45 years with an adjusted PR of 1.69 (95\% CI, 1.29
   to 2.21). All MetS components, except hypertension, were associated with
   severe periodontitis in this group.
   Conclusions There is a significant relationship between MetS and severe
   periodontitis in adults aged <45 years. Therefore, attempts to control
   the risk of MetS and periodontitis should be emphasized for early adults
   to reduce the incidence of these conditions and related complications
   when they become elderly.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The epidemiology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among
   HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) who do not inject drugs in
   Asia remains unknown. Method: The incidence and risk factors for
   incident HCV infection among HIV-infected MSM at a large HIV clinic in
   Tokyo were elucidated. Poisson regression compared the incidence of HCV
   seroconversion at different observation periods. Results: Of 753 HIV-1
   infected MSM patients negative for HCV antibody (HCVAb) at baseline and
   available follow-up HCVAb test, 21 patients (2.8\%) seroconverted to
   HCVAb positive over 2246 person-years (PY), for an incidence of 9.35 per
   1000 PY. The incidence increased over time from 0 per 1000 PY in
   2005-2006, 3.0 per 1000 PY in 2007-2008, 7.7 per 1000 PY in 2009-2010,
   to 24.9 per 1000 PY in 2011-2012 (P = 0.012). Of 21 incident cases, only
   4 (19\%) were injection drug users, and sensitivity analysis that
   excluded injection drug users yielded similar findings. Multivariate
   analysis identified illicit drug use to be an independent risk for HCV
   infection (hazard ratio = 3.006; 95\% confidence interval: 1.092 to
   8.275; P = 0.033). Conclusions: Incident HCV infection is increasing
   among HIV-1-infected MSM noninjection drug users at resource-rich
   setting in Asia. Illicit drug use is an independent risk factor for
   incident HCV infection in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Density modulated tungsten (W) thin films with nanoscale porosity
   contents of 7\% to 40\% by volume were grown on Si substrates through
   magnetron sputter deposition. Process parameters were selected according

   105 nm and 520 nm. Nanomechanical properties of samples were
   investigated by means of instrumented nanoindentation. Reduced-(2)
   analysis was carried out to assess four models formulated through
   differential effective medium approach. The model that factored in both
   the crowding effect and the maximum random packing of pores successfully
   captured the experimental trends. Attempts to breach the auxetic barrier
   resulted in large-scale pulverization or spontaneous conversion into
   WO3. Porosity corrected yield strength calculations underlined the
   possibility of defining a porosity threshold beyond which the
   compressive yield strength of density modulated nanoporous metallic thin
   films would drop abruptly due to aggravated geometric slenderness
   effects in agreement with earlier hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{Kirigami, the ancient paper art of cutting, has recently emerged as a
   new approach to construct metamaterials with novel properties imparted
   by cuts. However, most studies are limited to thin sheets-based 2D
   kirigami metamaterials with specific forms and limited reconfigurability
   due to planar connection constraints of cut units. Here, 3D modular
   kirigami is introduced by cutting bulk materials into spatially
   closed-loop connected cut cubes to construct a new class of 3D kirigami
   metamaterials. The module is transformable with multiple degrees of
   freedom that can transform into versatile distinct daughter building
   blocks. Their conformable assembly creates a wealth of reconfigurable
   and disassemblable metamaterials with diverse structures and unique
   properties, including reconfigurable 1D column-like materials, 2D
   lattice-like metamaterials with phase transition of chirality, as well
   as 3D frustration-free multilayered metamaterials with 3D auxetic
   behaviors and programmable deformation modes. This study largely expands
   the design space of kirigami metamaterials from 2D to 3D.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A long-standing question is why Poisson's ratio v nearly always exceeds
   0.2 for isotropic materials, whereas classical elasticity predicts v to
   be between -1 to 1/2. We show that the roots of quadratic relations from
   classical elasticity divide v into three possible ranges: -1<v >= 0, 0
   <= v <= 1/5, and 1/5 <= v<1/2. Since elastic properties are unique there
   can be only one valid set of roots, which must be 1/5 <= v<1/2 for
   consistency with the behavior of real materials. Materials with
   Poisson's ratio outside of this range are rare, and tend to be either
   very hard (e.g., diamond, beryllium etc.) or porous (e.g., auxetic
   foams); such substances have more complex behavior than can be described
   by classical elasticity. Thus, classical elasticity is inapplicable
   whenever v<1/5, and the use of the equations from classical elasticity
   for such materials is inappropriate.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Previous randomised trial data have demonstrated that male
   circumcision reduces Mycoplasma genitalium prevalence in men. We
   assessed whether male circumcision also reduces M genitalium infection
   in female partners of circumcised men.
   Methods HIV-negative men were enrolled and randomised to either male
   circumcision or control. Female partners of male trial participants from
   the intervention (n=437) and control (n=394) arms provided interview
   information and self-collected vaginal swabs that were tested for M
   genitalium by APTIMA transcription-mediated amplification-based assay.
   Prevalence risk ratios (PRR) and 95\% CI of M genitalium prevalence in
   intervention versus control group were estimated using Poisson
   regression. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. An as-treated analysis
   was conducted to account for study-group crossovers.
   Results Male and female partner enrolment sociodemographic
   characteristics, sexual behaviours, and symptoms of sexually transmitted
   infections were similar between study arms. Female M genitalium
   prevalence at year 2 was 3.2\% (14/437) in the intervention arm and
   3.6\% (14/394) in the control arm (PRR=0.90, 95\% CI 0.43 to 1.89,
   p=0.78). In an as-treated analysis, the prevalence of M genitalium was
   3.4\% in female partners of circumcised men and 3.3\% in female partners
   of uncircumcised men (PRR=1.01, 95\% CI 0.48 to 2.12, p=0.97).
   Conclusions Contrary to findings in men, male circumcision did not
   affect M genitalium infection in female partners.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Since 2000, notifications of HIV and other sexually
   transmitted infections (STIs) have increased significantly in Australian
   gay men. We evaluated the impact of a social marketing campaign in
   2008-2009 aimed to increase health-seeking behavior and STI testing and
   enhance HIV/STI knowledge in gay men.
   Methods: A convenience sample of 295 gay men (18-66 years of age) was
   surveyed to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign. Participants
   were asked about campaign awareness, HIV/STI knowledge, health-seeking
   behavior, and HIV/STI testing. We examined associations between recent
   STI testing and campaign awareness. Trends in HIV/STI monthly tests at 3
   clinics with a high case load of gay men were also assessed. Logistic
   and Poisson regressions and chi(2) tests were used.
   Results: Both unaided (43\%) and aided (86\%) campaign awareness was
   high. In a multivariable logistic regression, awareness of the campaign
   (aided) was independently associated with having had any STI test within
   the past 6 months (prevalence ratio = 1.5; 95\% confidence interval =
   1.0-2.4. Compared with the 13 months before the campaign, clinic data
   showed significant increasing testing rates for HIV, syphilis, and
   chlamydia among HIV-negative gay men during the initial and continued
   campaign periods.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that the campaign was successful in
   achieving its aims of increasing health-seeking behavior, STI testing,
   and HIV/STI knowledge among gay men in Victoria.}},

   Other more general analytical works have dealt with the application of
   electrical and magnetic fields to susceptible materials, usually
   involving a relatively hard fluid filled sandwich. In the present note
   the effect of soaking soft porous solids in magneto or
   electro-rheological fluids (MRF or ERF respectively) on their stiffness
   is announced. In this case the pores or cells of the carrier soft solid
   hold polarisable solids. When the resulting composites are excited by a
   magnetic (MRF) or electric field (ERF) the stiffness of the sections
   thus produced are increased (in a passive sense) under loading. Unique
   results are obtained when auxetic MR soft soaked foams are excited
   significant magnetostrictive effects are measured.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the role of sexually transmitted infection (STI)
   management to prevent HIV acquisition among sex workers in Burkina Faso.
   Design: Open cohort study of professional and nonprofessional sex
   workers with 3-month follow-up visits.
   Methods: Baseline and follow-up visits consisted of the administration
   of a behavioral questionnaire, education sessions on HIV and STIs, a
   medical examination, and laboratory testing for STI and HIV diagnosis.
   Results: Three hundred seventy-seven HIV-negative women were enrolled in
   the study. The cumulated HIV incidence was 3.2 per 100 person-years
   (Poisson 95\% confidence interval: 1.9-4.9). Bacterial and parasitic
   STIs were low at baseline, whereas herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2)
   prevalence was 54.7\%. By a Cox regression model, self-assessment of
   high HIV risk in the past, less than 5 clients per week, and no change
   of a steady partner were independently associated with HIV acquisition.
   Among STIs, only infection with HSV-2 tended to be associated with HIV
   acquisition (odds ratio = 2.45; P = 0.15). Overall, condom use increased
   during the study but to a lesser extent with steady partners.
   Conclusions: Bacterial and parasitic STIs are no longer a key
   determinant of HIV acquisition, given the current stage of the outbreak
   in Burkina Faso. Although efforts for STI control should be maintained,
   strategies should focus on nonprofessional sex workers, steady partners,
   and HSV-2 infection to tackle HIV transmission further in this high-risk
   group.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on size effects in periodic mechanical metamaterials
   driven by reversible pattern transformations due to local elastic
   buckling instabilities in their microstructure. Two distinct loading
   cases are studied: compression and bending, in which the material
   exhibits pattern transformation in the whole structure or only
   partially. The ratio between the height of the specimen and the size of
   a unit cell is defined as the scale ratio. A family of shifted
   microstructures, corresponding to all possible arrangements of the
   microstructure relative to the external boundary, is considered in order
   to determine the ensemble averaged solution computed for each scale
   ratio. In the compression case, the top and the bottom edges of the
   specimens are fully constrained, which introduces boundary layers with
   restricted pattern transformation. In the bending case, the top and
   bottom edges are free boundaries resulting in compliant boundary layers,
   whereas additional size effects emerge from imposed strain gradient. For
   comparison, the classical homogenization solution is computed and shown
   to match well with the ensemble averaged numerical solution only for
   very large scale ratios. For smaller scale ratios, where a size effect
   dominates, the classical homogenization no longer applies.}},

Abstract = {{Investigators in clinical research are often interested in determining
   the association between patient characteristics and cost of medical or
   surgical treatment. However, there is no uniformly agreed upon
   regression model with which to analyse cost data. The objective of the
   current study was to compare the performance of linear regression,
   linear regression with log-transformed cost, generalized linear models
   with Poisson, negative binomial and gamma distributions, median
   regression, and proportional hazards models for analysing costs in a
   cohort of patients undergoing CABG surgery. The study was performed on
   data comprising 1959 patients who underwent CABG surgery in Calgary,
   Alberta, between June 1994 and March 1998. Ten of 21 patient
   characteristics were significantly associated with cost of surgery in
   all seven models. Eight variables were not significantly associated with
   cost of surgery in all seven models. Using mean squared prediction error
   as a loss function, proportional hazards regression and the three
   generalized linear models were best able to predict cost in independent
   validation data. Using mean absolute error, linear regression with
   log-transformed cost, proportional hazards regression, and median
   regression to predict median cost, were best able to predict cost in
   independent validation data. Since the models demonstrated good
   consistency in identifying factors associated with increased cost of
   CABG surgery, any of the seven models can be used for identifying
   factors associated with increased cost of surgery. However, the
   magnitude of, and the interpretation of, the coefficients vary across
   models. Researchers are encouraged to consider a variety of candidate
   models, including those better known in the econometrics literature,
   rather than begin data analysis with one regression model selected a
   priori. The final choice of regression model should be made after a
   careful assessment of how best to assess predictive ability and should
   be tailored to the particular data in question. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{The mathematical model of ion transport in the field of electric forces
   and diffusion gradients is based on particle conservation equations and
   the Poisson equation which governs the distribution of the electric
   potential. Designed for evaluating the currents through passive ion
   channels in cellular membranes, the model is formulated in a
   two-dimensional approximation assuming rotational symmetry. Three ionic
   species are considered in the present study: sodium, calcium and
   chlorine. The program developed for the numerical solution is based on a
   semi-analytical approximation suggested by Gummel \& Scharfetter. The
   present contribution reports calculations of the steady-state
   distributions of ionic species induced by an electric field due to a
   negative potential drop across the cellular membrane, which represent
   initial conditions for future calculations of the time development of
   the ion flux through the calcium channel. The numerical calculations
   were performed from the moment of potential application up to the time
   6.2 mu s, when a new steady state is established. At this stage, the
   maximum values of the sodium and calcium concentrations at the membrane
   surface are about 22\% and 47\% above the initial values of 145 mM and 1
   mM, respectively, while the chlorine concentration is approximately 18\%
   below. The electric field at the membrane surface is about 6.7 x 10(4)
   and decreases exponentially with distance. The length of the boundary
   layer is about 40 Angstrom. Since the model is based on fundamental
   principles, it can be used for the quantitative solution of any problem
   possessing rotational symmetry where a continuum approach is applicable
   and some elementary conditions are fulfilled, such as equilibrium (or at
   least quasi-equilibrium) of the particle energy distributions with
   respect to time and electric field, and the assumption that the
   transport coefficients are defined as functions of the field and their
   numerical values are known. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Droplet Digital PCR and Quantitative PCR Assays for
   Quantitative Detection of Xanthomonas citri Subsp citri}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 18}},
Abstract = {{Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a novel molecular
   biology technique providing absolute quantification of target nucleic
   acids without the need for an external calibrator. Despite its emerging
   applications in medical diagnosis, there are few reports of its use for
   the detection of plant pathogens. This work was designed to assess the
   diagnosis potential of the ddPCR for absolute quantitative detection of
   Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, a quarantine plant pathogenic bacterium
   that causes citrus bacterial canker in susceptible Citrus species. We
   transferred an established quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for citrus
   bacterial canker diagnosis directly to the ddPCR format and compared the
   performance of the two methods. The qPCR assay has a broader dynamic
   range compared to the ddPCR assay and the ddPCR assay has a
   significantly higher degree of sensitivity compared to the qPCR assay.
   The influence of PCR inhibitors can be reduced considerably in the ddPCR
   assay because the collection of end-point fluorescent signals and the
   counting of binomial events (positive or negative droplets) are
   associated with a Poisson algorithm. The ddPCR assay also shows lower
   coefficient of variation compared to the qPCR assay especially in low
   target concentration. The linear association of the measurements by
   ddPCR and qPCR assays is strong (Pearson correlation = 0.8633; P<0.001).
   Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicates the ddPCR
   methodology is a more robust approach for diagnosis of citrus bacterial
   canker. In summary, the results demonstrated that the ddPCR assay has
   the potential for the quantitative detection of X. citri subsp. citri
   with high precision and accuracy as compared with the results from qPCR
   assay. Further studies are required to evaluate and validate the value
   of ddPCR technology in the diagnosis of plant disease and quarantine
   applications.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Biological effects of climate change are expected to vary
   geographically, with a strong signature of latitude. For ectothermic
   animals, there is systematic latitudinal variation in the relationship
   between climate and thermal performance curves, which describe the
   relationship between temperature and an organism's fitness. Here, we ask
   whether these documented latitudinal patterns can be generalized to
   predict arthropod responses to warming across mid-and high temperate
   latitudes, for taxa whose thermal physiology has not been measured. To
   address this question, we used a novel natural experiment consisting of
   a series of urban warming gradients at different latitudes.
   Specifically, we sampled arthropods from a single common street tree
   species across temperature gradients in four US cities, located from
   35.8 to 42.4 degrees latitude. We captured 6746 arthropods in 34
   families from 111 sites that varied in summer average temperature by
   1.7- 3.4 degrees C within each city. Arthropod responses to warming
   within each city were characterized as Poisson regression coefficients
   describing change in abundance per degrees C for each family. Family
   responses in the two midlatitude cities were heterogeneous, including
   significantly negative and positive effects, while those in
   high-latitude cities varied no more than expected by chance within each
   city. We expected high-latitude taxa to increase in abundance with
   warming, and they did so in one of the two high-latitude cities; in the
   other, Queens (New York City), most taxa declined with warming, perhaps
   due to habitat loss that was correlated with warming in this city. With
   the exception of Queens, patterns of family responses to warming were
   consistent with predictions based on known latitudinal patterns in
   arthropod physiology relative to regional climate. Heterogeneous
   responses in midlatitudes may be ecologically disruptive if interacting
   taxa respond oppositely to warming.}},

Abstract = {{Differential provision of local services and amenities has been proposed
   as a mechanism behind the relationship between social capital and
   health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether social capital
   and collective efficacy are related to the provision of social support
   services and amenities in Dutch municipalities, against a background of
   decentralisation of long-term care to municipalities. We used data on
   neighbourhood social capital, collective efficacy (the extent to which
   people are willing to work for the common good), and the provision of
   services and amenities in 2012. We included the services municipalities
   provide to support informal caregivers (e.g. respite care), individual
   services and support (e.g. domiciliary help), and general and collective
   services and amenities (e.g. lending point for wheelchairs). Data for
   social capital were collected between May 2011 and September 2012.
   Social capital was measured by focusing on contacts between neighbours.
   A social capital measure was estimated for 414 municipalities with
   ecometric measurements. A measure of collective efficacy was constructed
   based on information about the experienced responsibility for the
   liveability of the neighbourhood by residents in 2012, average charity
   collection returns in municipalities in 2012, voter turnout at the
   municipal elections in 2010 and the percentage of blood donors in 2012.
   We conducted Poisson regression and negative binomial regression to test
   our hypotheses. We found no relationship between social capital and the
   provision of services and amenities in municipalities. We found an
   interaction effect (coefficient=3.11, 95\% CI=0.72-5.51, P=0.011) of
   social capital and collective efficacy on the provision of support
   services for informal caregivers in rural municipalities. To gain more
   insight in the relationship between social capital and health, it will
   be important to study the relationship between social capital and
   differential provision of services and amenities more extensively and in
   different contexts.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical and solvent transport properties of model whey protein
   hydrogels were characterized by mechanical indentation. Using
   cylindrical indenters with a large size range, 0.2-6 mm, it is confirmed
   that most of the force relaxation measured during indentation is
   poroelastic in nature, i.e. due to solvent transport. An additional,
   smaller, viscoelastic relaxation is observed with a relaxation time of
   similar to 10 s. A new microindentation apparatus was built to test
   hydrogels using small indenters, resulting in constant solvent
   diffusivities and permeabilites with indenter sizes 0.2-1 mm, at roughly
   similar to 4.10(-10) m(2)/s and similar to 5.10(-18) m(2) respectively,
   regardless of the swelling conditions considered. Relaxations, however,
   do not reach constant force values at very long times, increasing the
   uncertainty of the poroviscoelastic analysis. Despite this, the auxetic
   behaviour of whey protein hydrogels is highly likely, as inferred from
   consistent drained Poisson's ratios lower than 0. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence quenching experiments were
   performed on a series of random terpolymers comprising sodium acrylate,
   acrylamide, and a phenanthrene (Phen) derivative. The polymers in this
   series had a fixed Phen loading (4 mol \%) and differed in the relative
   composition of the acrylate and acrylamide monomers. Fluorescence
   quenching by Tl+ and Cs+ was measured as a function of ionic strength in
   basic aqueous solutions. The apparent bimolecular rate constant for
   quenching (k(q)) is on the order of 10(12) M(-1) s(-1) at low ionic
   strength and diminishes by approximately 1 order of magnitude at 14 mM
   added ionic strength. This behavior is independent of the particular
   group 1A counterion salt but does depend on the polyelectrolyte linear
   charge density. At relatively high quencher concentration both Tl+ and
   Cs+ display negative curvature in their I-0/I Stem-Volmer plots.
   `'Displacement'' experiments were carried out in which K+ is added to a
   solution of the polyelectrolyte with a fixed concentration of Tl+,
   thereby decreasing the fluorescence quenching. These data and membrane
   dialysis imply preferential binding of the Tl+ to the polyelectrolyte
   (compared to Na+ and K+). A restricted geometry model based on Manning
   condensation theory is presented that captures many of the features of a
   Poisson-Boltzmann reaction-diffusion calculation of the quenching
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{This exploratory paper presents some preliminary results on the use of
   full-field deformation measurements on low density polymeric foams to
   identify the evolution of Poisson's ratio with compressive strain. Two
   types of foams were tested: a standard low density polyurethane foam and
   an auxetic foam manufactured from a similar precursor. 2D digital image
   correlation was used to measure the strain field at the specimens
   surfaces. Then, Poisson's ratios were identified using a dedicated
   inverse method called the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) and the results
   compared with the standard approaches. The results illustrate the
   advantages of the VFM compared to the standard procedure. It was also
   found that for the standard foam, very strong localization effects
   resulted in biased Poisson's ratio evaluation. It was shown that this
   could be corrected by taking into account these localization effects
   thanks to the full-field information.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Number = {{25}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are usually designed to exhibit novel
   properties and functionalities that are rare or even unprecedented. What
   is common among most previous designs is the quasi-static nature of
   their mechanical behavior. Here, we introduce a previously unidentified
   class of strain rate-dependent mechanical metamaterials. The principal
   idea is to laterally attach two beams with very different levels of
   strain rate-dependencies to make them act as a single bi-beam. We use an
   analytical model and multiple computational models to explore the
   instability modes of such a bi-beam construct, demonstrating how
   different combinations of hyperelastic and viscoelastic properties of
   both beams, as well as purposefully introduced geometric imperfections,
   could be used to create robust and highly predictable strain
   rate-dependent behaviors of bi-beams. We then use the bi-beams to design
   and experimentally realize lattice structures with unique strain
   rate-dependent properties including switching between auxetic and
   conventional behaviors and negative viscoelasticity.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Regression Methods for Modeling Intensive Care Length of
   Stay}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{Intensive care units (ICUs) are increasingly interested in assessing and
   improving their performance. ICU Length of Stay (LoS) could be seen as
   an indicator for efficiency of care. However, little consensus exists on
   which prognostic method should be used to adjust ICU LoS for case-mix
   factors. This study compared the performance of different regression
   models when predicting ICU LoS. We included data from 32,667 unplanned
   ICU admissions to ICUs participating in the Dutch National Intensive
   Care Evaluation (NICE) in the year 2011. We predicted ICU LoS using
   eight regression models: ordinary least squares regression on
   untransformed ICU LoS, LoS truncated at 30 days and log-transformed LoS;
   a generalized linear model with a Gaussian distribution and a
   logarithmic link function; Poisson regression; negative binomial
   regression; Gamma regression with a logarithmic link function; and the
   original and recalibrated APACHE IV model, for all patients together and
   for survivors and non-survivors separately. We assessed the predictive
   performance of the models using bootstrapping and the squared Pearson
   correlation coefficient (R-2), root mean squared prediction error
   (RMSPE), mean absolute prediction error (MAPE) and bias. The
   distribution of ICU LoS was skewed to the right with a median of 1.7
   days (interquartile range 0.8 to 4.0) and a mean of 4.2 days (standard
   deviation 7.9). The predictive performance of the models was between
   0.09 and 0.20 for R-2, between 7.28 and 8.74 days for RMSPE, between
   3.00 and 4.42 days for MAPE and between 22.99 and 1.64 days for bias.
   The predictive performance was slightly better for survivors than for
   non-survivors. We were disappointed in the predictive performance of the
   regression models and conclude that it is difficult to predict LoS of
   unplanned ICU admissions using patient characteristics at admission time
   only.}},

Title = {{Subfertility among HIV-affected couples in a safer conception cohort in
   South Africa}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{221}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Subfertility among couples affected by HIV has an impact on
   the well-being of couples who desire to have children and may prolong
   HIV exposure. Subfertility in the antiretroviral therapy era and its
   determinants have not yet been well characterized.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the burden and
   determinants of subfertility among HIV-affected couples seeking safer
   conception services in South Africa.
   STUDY DESIGN: Nonpregnant women and male partners in HIV seroconcordant
   or HIV discordant relationships desiring a child were enrolled in the
   Sakh'umndeni safer conception cohort at Witkoppen Clinic in Johannesburg
   between July 2013 and April 2017. Clients were followed up prospectively
   through pregnancy (if they conceived) or until 6 months of attempted
   conception, after which they were referred for infertility services.
   Subfertility was defined as not having conceived within 6 months of
   attempted conception. Robust Poisson regression was used to assess the
   association between baseline characteristics and subfertility outcomes;
   inverse probability weighting was used to account for missing data from
   women lost to safer conception care before 6 months of attempted
   conception.
   RESULTS: Among 334 couples enrolled, 65\% experienced subfertility
   (inverse probability weighting weighted, 95\% confidence interval,
   0.59-0.73), of which 33\% were primary subfertility and 67\% secondary
   subfertility. Compared with HIV-negative women, HIV-positive women not
   on antiretroviral therapy had a 2-fold increased risk of subfertility
   (weighted and adjusted risk ratio, 2.00; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.19-3.34). Infertility risk was attenuated in women on antiretroviral
   therapy but remained elevated, even after >= 2 years on antiretroviral
   therapy (weighted and adjusted risk ratio, 1.63; 95\% confidence
   interval, 0.98-2.69). Other factors associated with subfertility were
   female age (weighted and adjusted risk ratio, 1.03, 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.01-1.05 per year), male HIV-positive status (weighted and
   adjusted risk ratio, 1.31; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02-1.68), male
   smoking (weighted and adjusted risk ratio, 1.29; 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.05-1.60), and trying to conceive for >= 1 year (weighted and
   adjusted risk ratio, 1.38; 95\% confidence interval, 1.13-1.68).
   CONCLUSION: Two in 3 HIV-affected couples experienced subfertility.
   HIV-positive women were at increased risk of subfertility, even when on
   antiretroviral therapy. Both male and female HIV status were associated
   with subfertility. Subfertility is an underrecognized reproductive
   health problem in resource-limited settings and may contribute to
   prolonged HIV exposure and transmission within couples. Low-cost
   approaches for screening and treating subfertility in this population
   are needed.}},

Abstract = {{A rational new plate theory must meet specific guidelines and cannot be
   proposed by merely choosing a different function for the transverse
   variations of the displacement components. In the present research, a
   novel hyperbolic global-local plate theory is proposed based on 8
   criteria, for the first time and implemented in a new energy formulation
   that takes into account the potential energy of the contact region, for
   behavior analysis of biaxially preloaded sandwich plates with
   unevenly-distributed SMA wires and soft cores under impulsive/impact
   loads. The proposed theory contains both odd and even functions and
   consequently, is more appropriate for asymmetric lamination schemes; in
   addition to satisfying the continuity condition of the interlaminar
   stresses. It is the first time that stress-strain asymmetry and
   anisotropy of the SMA is incorporated in the impact response analysis.
   Modified micro-macro-mechanical and bridging models are employed to
   relate the apparent properties to the local ones and vice versa. Effects
   of the uniform, double-linear, and double-sinusoidal distributions of
   the SMA wires are compared. The localized time variations of phases
   evolutions of the anisotropic SMA wires are predicted based on a
   particular algorithm, employing an iteration-based updating solution
   procedure for the resulting finite element formulation within each time
   step.}},

Title = {{Reprogrammable shape morphing of magnetic soft machines}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Shape-morphing magnetic soft machines are highly desirable for diverse
   applications in minimally invasive medicine, wearable devices, and soft
   robotics. Despite recent progress, current magnetic programming
   approaches are inherently coupled to sequential fabrication processes,
   preventing reprogrammability and high-throughput programming. Here, we
   report a high-throughput magnetic programming strategy based on heating
   magnetic soft materials above the Curie temperature of the embedded
   ferromagnetic particles and reorienting their magnetic domains by
   applying magnetic fields during cooling. We demonstrate discrete,
   three-dimensional, and reprogrammable magnetization with high spatial
   resolution (similar to 38 mu m). Using the reprogrammable magnetization
   capability, reconfigurable mechanical behavior of an auxetic
   metamaterial structure, tunable locomotion of a surface-walking soft
   robot, and adaptive grasping of a soft gripper are shown. Our approach
   further enables high-throughput magnetic programming (up to 10
   samples/min) via contact transfer. Heat-assisted magnetic programming
   strategy described here establishes a rich design space and
   mass-manufacturing capability for development of multiscale and
   reprogrammable soft machines.}},

Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Architectured materials with rationally designed geometries could be
   used to create mechanical metamaterials with unprecedented or rare
   properties and functionalities. Here, we introduce ``shape-matching{''}
   metamaterials where the geometry of cellular structures comprising
   auxetic and conventional unit cells is designed so as to achieve a
   pre-defined shape upon deformation. We used computational models to
   forward-map the space of planar shapes to the space of geometrical
   designs. The validity of the underlying computational models was first
   demonstrated by comparing their predictions with experimental
   observations on specimens fabricated with indirect additive
   manufacturing. The forward-maps were then used to devise the geometry of
   cellular structures that approximate the arbitrary shapes described by
   random Fourier's series. Finally, we show that the presented
   metamaterials could match the contours of three real objects including a
   scapula model, a pumpkin, and a Delft Blue pottery piece. Shape-matching
   materials have potential applications in soft robotics and wearable
   (medical) devices.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Modern fabrication techniques, such as additive manufacturing, can be
   used to create materials with complex custom internal structures. These
   engineered materials exhibit a much broader range of bulk properties
   than their base materials and are typically referred to as metamaterials
   or microstructures. Although metamaterials with extraordinary properties
   have many applications, designing them is very difficult and is
   generally done by hand. We propose a computational approach to discover
   families of microstructures with extremal macroscale properties
   automatically. Using efficient simulation and sampling techniques, we
   compute the space of mechanical properties covered by physically
   realizable microstructures. Our system then clusters microstructures
   with common topologies into families. Parameterized templates are
   eventually extracted from families to generate new microstructure
   designs. We demonstrate these capabilities on the computational design
   of mechanical metamaterials and present five auxetic microstructure
   families with extremal elastic material properties. Our study opens the
   way for the completely automated discovery of extremal microstructures
   across multiple domains of physics, including applications reliant on
   thermal, electrical, and magnetic properties.}},

Abstract = {{Light layer honeycomb panels could replace traditional wood materials,

   this research was to design and determine elastic properties of sandwich
   panels (SPs) based on a dual corrugated HDF core. Stiffness matrix
   values of elements were determined by a numerical method. The 3D
   calculation results were compared with those of the homogeneous model.
   The calculation results were collated with those of experimental
   investigations. It was demonstrated that the linear elasticity modulus
   as well as the modulus of rupture of the SPs were comparable with
   mechanical properties of a particle board with identical thickness,
   while the SP has a 1/3 lower density. The panel core exhibited
   significant orthotropic properties. In the xy plane it could be
   characterized as an auxetic structure. The homogeneous model leads to
   results similar to those achieved from the 3D model and observed in

Abstract = {{The behavior of chiral elastic materials is of interest to the fields of
   auxetic materials, carbon nanotubes, honeycomb structures and mechanics
   of bone. The chiral effects cannot be described within classical
   elasticity. In this paper we study the deformation of isotropic chiral
   solids by using the theory of Cosserat elasticity. We investigate the
   behavior of a bar composed by two different materials. The intended
   applications of the solution are to bone implants and various compound
   cylinders. The bar is reinforced by a longitudinal rod and is subjected
   to extension, bending and torsion. It is shown that the compression of
   the composed cylinder, in contrast with the result predicted by the
   theory of achiral materials, is accompanied by torsion and bending. The
   method is used to investigate the case of a circular cylinder reinforced
   by a circular rod. In this case the compression of the bar produces only
   a twist around its axis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   22MnB5 tubes}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the effects of various laser patterns on
   as-received 22MnB5 tubes for selective local strengthening. It has been
   confirmed that strengthened cross-sectional areas, perpendicular to the
   axial direction by laser patterning, and uniform strength distributions
   between the as-received and strengthened area can induce the concertina
   mode under axial crushing. The auxetic and helical laser patterns
   demonstrated the highest first peaks in the reaction force and
   substantial energy absorption due to progressive folding, followed by
   the concertina mode. Considering the fabrication efficiency, the helical
   pattern is recommended because it can be easily implemented. To optimize
   the helical pattern design, the specific pitch size should be based on
   the line length of a single fold along the neutral surface when the
   as-received tube collapses. Depending on the geometrical dimensions of
   the tube, this can increase the number of folds and maximise energy
   absorption by up to 32.2\% during axial crushing.}},

Journal = {{PLANT DISEASE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{43-54}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between strawberry powdery mildew and airborne conidium
   concentration (ACC) of Podosphaera aphanis was studied using data
   collected from 2006 to 2009 in 15 fields, and spatial pattern was
   described using 2 years of airborne inoculum and disease incidence data
   collected in fields planted with the June-bearing strawberry (Fragaria x
   ananassa) cultivar Jewel. Disease incidence, expressed as the proportion
   of diseased leaflets, and ACC were monitored in fields divided into 3 x
   8 grids containing 24 100 m(2) quadrats. Variance-to-mean ratio, index
   of dispersion, negative binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, and
   binomial and beta-binomial distributions were used to characterize the
   level of spatial heterogeneity. The relationship between percent leaf
   area diseased and daily ACC was linear, while the relationship between
   ACC and disease incidence followed an exponential growth curve. The V/M
   ratios were significantly greater than 1 for 100 and 96\% of the
   sampling dates for ACC sampled at 0.35 m from the ground (ACC(0.35m))
   and for ACC sampled at 1.0 m from the ground (ACC(1.0m)), respectively.
   For disease incidence, the index of dispersion D was significantly
   greater than 1 for 79\% of the sampling dates. The negative binomial
   distribution fitted 86\% of the data sets for both ACC(1.0m) and
   ACC(0.35m). For disease incidence data, the beta-binomial distribution
   provided a good fit of 75\% of the data sets. Taylor's power law
   indicated that, for ACC at both sampling heights, heterogeneity
   increased with increasing mean ACC, whereas the binary form of the power
   law suggested that heterogeneity was not dependent on the mean for
   disease incidence. When the spatial location of each sampling location
   was taken into account, Spatial Analysis by Distance Indices showed low
   aggregation indices for both ACCs and disease incidence, and weak
   association between ACC and disease incidence. Based on these analyses,
   it was found that the distribution of strawberry powdery mildew was
   weakly aggregated. Although a higher level of heterogeneity was observed
   for airborne inoculum, the heterogeneity was low with no distinct foci,
   suggesting that epidemics are induced by well-distributed inoculum. This
   low level of heterogeneity allows mean airborne inoculum concentration
   to be estimated using only one sampler per field with an overall
   accuracy of at least 0.841. The results obtained in this study could be
   used to develop a sampling scheme that will improve strawberry powdery
   mildew risk estimation.}},

   (Norplant). Poisson regression estimated adjusted incidence rate ratios
   (adjIRRs) associated with hormonal contraceptive methods. A case-control
   subanalysis estimated odds ratios (ORs) of HIV associated with hormonal
   contraceptive, adjusted for viral load and age.
   Results: We identified 190 male HIV-positive/ female HIV-negative (M+F-)
   and 159 male HIV-negative/female HIV-positive (M-F+) couples not using
   antiretroviral therapy or condoms. Female HIV incidence was 5.8/100
   person-years (py) among nonhormonal contraceptive users, 12.0/100 py
   among oral contraceptive users {[}adjIRR 2.65, 95\% confidence interval
   (CI) 0.82-8.60], 4.5 among Norplant users (adjIRR: 0.89, 95\% CI
   0.11-7.10), and 7.5/100 py among DMPA users (adjIRR 1.42, 95\% CI
   0.60-3.36). Male HIV incidence was 7.4/100 py during nonhormonal
   contraceptive use, 16.5/100 py during female oral contraceptive use
   (adjIRR 2.52, 95\% CI 0.49-12.95), and 4.9/100 py with DMPA use (adjIRR
   0.57, 95\% CI 0.19-1.70). The number of female seroconverters was three
   among oral contraceptive users, one among Norplant users, and seven
   among DMPA users. Male seroconverters were two during female oral
   contraceptive use, none with Norplant use, and three with DMPA use. In a
   nested case-control analysis after adjustment for HIV viral load, the
   adjOR associated with oral contraceptive use was 1.59 (95\% CI
   0.32-97.85) for M+F- and 2.11 (95\% CI 0.18-25.26) for M-F+ couples. For
   DMPA use, the adjOR was 1.44 (95\% CI 0.46-4.51) for M+F- and 1.40 (95\%
   CI 0.30-6.49) for M-F+ couples.
   Conclusion: We did not observe significant risk of HIV acquisition or
   transmission with oral contraceptives or DMPA use in HIV discordant
   couples, but several point estimates were above 1.0 and statistical
   power was limited. (C) 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar

Abstract = {{Nature is ripe with biological organisms that can interact with its
   surroundings to continuously morph their surface texture. Many attempts
   have been made to optimize artificial surfaces depending on operational
   needs; however, most of these architected materials only focus on
   enhancing a specific material property or functionality. This study
   introduces a new class of instability-induced morphable structures,
   herein referred to as ``Active Skins{''}, which enables on-demand,
   reversible, surface morphing through buckling-induced feature
   deployment. By taking advantage of a preconceived auxetic unit cell
   geometrical design, mechanical instabilities were introduced to
   facilitate rapid out-of-plane deformations when in-plane strains are
   applied. Here, these notches were introduced at judiciously chosen
   locations in an array of unit cells to elicit unique patterns of
   out-of-plane deformations to pave way for controlling bulk Active Skin
   behavior. These purposefully designed imperfections were employed for
   selectively actuating them for applications ranging from camouflage to
   surface morphing to soft robotic grippers.}},

   predicted a few novel materials with auxetic behavior. The uncertainty

Abstract = {{This research presents a preliminary study on finding predictable
   methods of controlling the self-folding behaviors of weft knit textiles
   for use in the development of smart textiles and garment devices, such

   knitting technology, Shima Seiki industrial knitting machines, and the
   study of paper origami tessellation patterns were used as tools to
   understand and predict the self-folding abilities of weft knit textiles.
   A wide range of self-folding weft knit structures was produced, and
   relationships between the angles and ratios of the knit and purl stitch
   types were determined. Mechanical testing was used as a means to
   characterize differences produced by stitch patterns, and to further
   understand the relationships between angles and folding abilities. By
   defining a formulaic method for predicting the nature of the folds that
   occur due to stitch architecture patterns, we can better design
   self-folding fabrics for smart textile applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the equivalent homogeneous uniaxial mechanical
   properties of defective single-wall carbon nanotubes. In particular,
   non-reconstructed defects that can be produced by ion or electronic
   irradiation have been considered. A discrete nonlinear finite-element
   approach based on the mechanical properties of individual carbon-carbon
   ( C-C) bonds has been used. The individual C-C bonds in turn were
   simulated as beam structural elements. Extensive Monte Carlo based
   numerical simulation has been reported in the paper. The results show
   that the homogeneous elastic properties of the defective nanotubes can
   be qualitatively and quantitatively different from the pristine
   configurations. The defective nanotubes show a slight reduction in axial
   stiffness ( Young's modulus), but large variations of Poisson's ratio
   outside the elastic bounds for isotropic materials, depending on the
   locations of the vacancies. The large fluctuations of Poisson's ratio
   can lead to extreme positive transversal contractions or to auxetic
   behaviour when the nanotubes are subjected to tensile loading.}},

Abstract = {{Water inside the low-dimensional carbon structures has been considered
   seriously owing to fundamental interest in its flow and structures as
   well as its practical impact. Recently, the anomalous perfect
   penetration of water through graphene oxide membrane was demonstrated
   although the membrane was impenetrable for other liquids and even gases.
   The unusual auxetic behavior of graphene oxide in the presence of water
   was also reported. Here, on the basis of first-principles calculations,
   we establish atomistic models for hybrid systems composed of water and
   graphene oxides revealing the anomalous water behavior inside the
   stacked graphene oxides. We show that formation of hexagonal ice bilayer
   in between the flakes as well as melting transition of ice at the edges
   of flakes are crucial to realize the perfect water permeation stacked
   structures. The distance between adjacent layers that can be controlled
   either by oxygen reduction process or pressure is shown to determine the
   water flow thus highlighting a unique water dynamics in randomly
   connected two-dimensional spaces.}},

Abstract = {{Background Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 or HPV18 elicits

   Methods Study participants were women aged 18-25 years at enrollment in
   the control group of the ongoing National Cancer Institute-sponsored,
   community-based, randomized HPV16/18 Costa Rica Vaccine Trial. At
   enrollment, 2813 participants were negative for cervical HPV16 DNA and
   2950 for HPV18 DNA. Women were interviewed regarding sociodemographic
   data and medical and health history. Medical and pelvic examinations
   were conducted for all consenting sexually experienced women. Serum
   samples taken at enrollment were tested for total HPV16/18 antibodies
   with a polyclonal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and cervical
   specimens were tested for type-specific HPV DNA over 4 years of
   follow-up. Using Poisson regression, we compared rate ratios of newly
   detected cervical HPV16 or HPV18 infection among homologous
   HPV-seropositive and HPV-seronegative women, adjusting for age,
   education, marital status, lifetime number of sexual partners, and
   smoking.
   Results There were 231 newly detected HPV16 infections during 5886

   detected HPV16 infections during 581 person-years among
   HPV16-seropositive women with the highest HPV16 sero-levels. There were

   HPV18-seronegative women compared with six new infections detected
   during 675 person-years among HPV18 seropositives with the highest

   0.50, 95\% confidence interval = 0.26 to 0.86 vs HPV16-seronegative
   women). Similarly, having high HPV18 antibody titer at enrollment was
   associated with a reduced risk of subsequent HPV18 infection (women in
   the highest tertile of HPV18 antibody titers, adjusted rate ratio =
   0.36, 95\% confidence interval = 0.14 to 0.76 vs HPV18-seronegative
   women).
   Conclusion In this study population, having high antibody levels against
   HPV16 and HPV18 following natural infection was associated with reduced
   risk of subsequent HPV16 and HPV18 infections.}},

Title = {{A review of statistical estimators for risk-adjusted length of stay:
   analysis of the Australian and new Zealand intensive care adult patient
   data-base, 2008-2009}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: For the analysis of length-of-stay (LOS) data, which is
   characteristically right-skewed, a number of statistical estimators have
   been proposed as alternatives to the traditional ordinary least squares
   (OLS) regression with log dependent variable.
   Methods: Using a cohort of patients identified in the Australian and New
   Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database, 2008-2009, 12
   different methods were used for estimation of intensive care (ICU)
   length of stay. These encompassed risk-adjusted regression analysis of
   firstly: log LOS using OLS, linear mixed model {[}LMM], treatment
   effects, skew-normal and skew-t models; and secondly: unmodified (raw)
   LOS via OLS, generalised linear models {[}GLMs] with log-link and 4
   different distributions {[}Poisson, gamma, negative binomial and
   inverse-Gaussian], extended estimating equations {[}EEE] and a finite
   mixture model including a gamma distribution. A fixed covariate list and
   ICU-site clustering with robust variance were utilised for model fitting
   with split-sample determination (80\%) and validation (20\%) data sets,
   and model simulation was undertaken to establish over-fitting (Copas
   test). Indices of model specification using Bayesian information
   criterion {[}BIC: lower values preferred] and residual analysis as well
   as predictive performance (R-2, concordance correlation coefficient
   (CCC), mean absolute error {[}MAE]) were established for each estimator.
   Results: The data-set consisted of 111663 patients from 131 ICUs; with
   mean(SD) age 60.6(18.8) years, 43.0\% were female, 40.7\% were
   mechanically ventilated and ICU mortality was 7.8\%. ICU length-of-stay
   was 3.4(5.1) (median 1.8, range (0.17-60)) days and demonstrated marked
   kurtosis and right skew (29.4 and 4.4 respectively). BIC showed
   considerable spread, from a maximum of 509801 (OLS-raw scale) to a
   minimum of 210286 (LMM). R2 ranged from 0.22 (LMM) to 0.17 and the CCC
   from 0.334 (LMM) to 0.149, with MAE 2.2-2.4. Superior residual behaviour
   was established for the log-scale estimators. There was a general
   tendency for over-prediction (negative residuals) and for over-fitting,
   the exception being the GLM negative binomial estimator. The
   mean-variance function was best approximated by a quadratic function,
   consistent with log-scale estimation; the link function was estimated
   (EEE) as 0.152(0.019, 0.285), consistent with a fractional-root
   function.
   Conclusions: For ICU length of stay, log-scale estimation, in particular
   the LMM, appeared to be the most consistently performing estimator(s).
   Neither the GLM variants nor the skew-regression estimators dominated.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are disproportionately affected
   by sexually transmitted infections (STI), including chlamydia and
   gonorrhea. Transactional sex is an hypothesized risk factor for STI
   acquisition in BMSM. Methods
   We estimated the association of transactional sex with incident
   chlamydia/gonococcal infection among BMSM using longitudinal data from a
   randomized trial in Atlanta (2012-2015). BMSM were eligible for
   inclusion if they tested human immunodeficiency virus
   (HIV)-antibody-negative and reported both >= 2 male sex partners and any
   condomless anal sex in the last year. We defined chlamydia/gonorrhea
   incidence as the first occurrence of either rectal or urogenital
   chlamydia or gonococcal infections after a negative result at
   enrollment. We used Poisson regression to estimate the incidence rate
   (IR) for chlamydia/gonorrhea over 12 months. Incidence rate ratios (IRR)
   compared estimates by reported experience of transactional sex. Subgroup
   analyses assessed potential heterogeneity by age and sexual identity.
   Results
   This analysis included 416 BMSM, of whom 191 (46\%) were gay-identified,
   146 (42\%) reported a history of transactional sex, and 57 (14\%) had
   prevalent chlamydia/gonococcal infection at baseline. Over a median of 1
   year of follow-up, an additional 55 men tested laboratory-positive for
   chlamydia/gonorrhea (IR, 17.3 per 100 person-years). Transactional sex
   was not associated with chlamydia/gonorrhea incidence overall. However,
   among gay-identified BMSM, transactional sex was associated with
   incident chlamydia/gonorrhea (IRR, 2.9; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.2-6.8). Conclusions
   Economic and social vulnerabilities may motivate engagement in high-risk
   sexual behaviors through commodified sex, potentially increasing the
   burden of STIs among BMSM. In this investigation, the relationship
   between transactional sex and chlamydia/gonorrhea was not homogenous
   across BMSM with diverse sexual identities in Atlanta, suggesting that
   within select sexual networks, transactional sex may drive STI risks.
   Delivering accessible and targeted STI screening for marginalized BMSM
   should be prioritized for STI and HIV prevention.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) have been actively investigated as
   stimuli-controlled actuators and soft robots. The basis of these
   applications is the ability of LCEs to undergo a reversible shape change
   upon a liquid crystalline (LC)-isotropic phase transition. Herein, we
   report the synthesis of a novel LCE based on a side-chain liquid
   crystalline polymer (SCLCP). In contrast to known LCEs, this LCE
   exhibits a striking anomalous shape change. Subjecting a mechanically
   stretched monodomain strip to LC-disorder phase transition, both the
   length and width of the strip contract in isotropic phase, and both
   elongate in LC phase. This thermally induced behaviour is the result of
   a subtle interplay between the relaxation of polymer main chain oriented
   along the stretching direction and the disordering of side-group
   mesogens oriented perpendicularly to the stretching direction. This
   finding points out potential design of LCEs of this peculiar type and
   possible applications to exploit.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   People with HIV (PWH) have a high burden of bacterial sexually
   transmitted infections (STIs). We examined the relationship of alcohol
   and drug use and partner pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use to STI
   prevalence in a cohort of PWH with a history of unhealthy alcohol use.
   Methods
   We analysed data from a primary care-based alcohol intervention study at
   Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Participants were
   recruited between April 2013 and May 2015 and were followed for up to 24
   months. We linked participant responses to questions from the 24 month
   follow-up interview, including alcohol and drug use and partner PrEP
   use, with STI test results (ie, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhoea) in the
   KPNC electronic health record. Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated
   using Poisson models fitted with robust variance estimators to evaluate
   the association of substance use and partner use of PrEP with STIs.
   Results
   In the analytic sample (n=465), the median age was 52 years (IQR 45-59);
   67\% were white; 95\% were men who have sex with men. Thirty-two per
   cent of participants had HIV-positive partners only; 31\% had
   HIV-negative partners with at least one on PrEP in the previous year and
   37\% had HIV-negative partners without any on PrEP. Twenty-three per
   cent reported alcohol and drug use prior to sex in the last 6 months.
   Eight per cent of participants had an STI. Partner PrEP use (adjusted PR
   (aPR) 2.99 (95\% CI 1.11 to 8.08)) was independently associated with
   higher STI prevalence. Participants who reported use of alcohol (aPR
   1.53 (0.61 to 3.83)), drugs (aPR 1.97 (0.71 to 5.51)) or both (aPR 1.93
   (0.75 to 4.97)) prior to sex had a higher STI prevalence.
   Conclusions
   The higher prevalence of STIs among PWH with unhealthy alcohol use who
   have partners on PrEP suggests that this subgroup may be a high-yield
   focus for targeted outreach, STI screening and sexual health
   counselling.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To estimate the prevalence of visual impairment (VI) and associated
   factors and further quantify its association with social isolation,
   depression and life satisfaction among older adults in Ghana.
   Methods WHO Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health Ghana dataset for
   older adults 50 years and above was used for this study. Social
   isolation, depression and life satisfaction were our primary outcomes
   with VI being our secondary outcome. We employed negative binomial,
   Poisson and generalised negative binomial regression models individually
   modified with Coarsened Exact Matching method of analysis. All analysis
   was performed by adopting robust SE estimation using Stata V.15.
   Results The prevalence of VI was 17.1\% (95\% CI14.3 to 20.2) and the
   factors associated include age groups, educational level, religion,
   region, where the participant was born, and difficulty in
   work/households activity (p<0.05). The inferential analysis shows that
   the significant log-likelihood score of social isolation and life
   satisfaction for older adults with VI was 0.25 more (95\% CI 0.03 to
   0.47) and 0.04 less (95\% CI -0.08 to -0.01), respectively, compared
   with those without VI. The prevalence of depression among older adults
   with VI was significantly 90\% higher compared with non-VI (adjusted
   prevalence ratio (95\% CI) = 1.90 (1.17 to 3.09), p<0.001).
   Conclusion The prevalence of VI is associated with increasing age,
   educational level and self-rated health. VI was identified to be
   associated with social isolation, depression and diminishing life
   satisfaction. In order to achieve sustainable development goal \#3, a
   national focus on geriatric care as part of the implementation of the
   National Ageing Policy will garner improvement in the quality of life of
   older adults with visual VI in Ghana. Eye health practitioners at all
   levels of the health systems should consider the psychosocial
   consequences of VI for the optimum care of the older adult client.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Female sex workers (FSW) are disproportionately affected by
   HIV in Cameroon, with an estimated 23.6\% HIV prevalence. Given the
   unavailability of HIV incidence data, to better understand associations
   with acquiring HIV we assessed the prevalence and associations with new
   HIV diagnoses among FSW in Cameroon.
   Methods: In 2016, FSW were recruited through respondent-driven sampling
   from 5 cities for a biobehavioral survey. Participants sel-freporting
   living with HIV or with an indeterminate test status were excluded from
   analysis. New diagnoses were defined as testing HIV-positive when
   participants self-reported HIV-negative or unknown status. A
   multivariable modified Poisson regression model was developed to assess
   determinants of new HIV diagnosis (referent group: HIV-negative) using
   key covariates; adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) are reported if
   statistically significant (P < 0.05).
   Results: Overall 2255 FSW were recruited. Excluding participants who
   self-reported living with HIV (n = 297) and indeterminate test results
   (n = 7), 260/1951 (13.3\%) FSW were newly diagnosed with HIV. Variables
   significantly associated with new HIV diagnosis were: no
   secondary/higher education {[}aPR: 1.56, 95\% confidence interval (CI):
   1.12 to 2.15], 5+ dependents compared with none (aPR: 2.11, 95\% CI:
   1.01 to 4.40), 5+ years involved in sex work compared with <1 year (aPR:
   2.84, 95\% CI: 1.26 to 6.42), history of incarceration (aPR: 2.13, 95\%
   CI: 1.13 to 3.99), and low social capital (aPR: 1.53, 95\% CI: 1.12 to
   2.10). Higher monthly income (>250,000 FCFA vs. <50,000 FCFA) was
   associated with lower prevalence of new HIV diagnosis (aPR: 0.22, 95\%
   CI: 0.05 to 0.86).
   Conclusions: There are significant sociostructural factors that seem to
   potentiate risk of HIV infection and delay diagnosis among FSW in
   Cameroon. Initiatives to build social capital and integrate services
   such as pre-exposure prophylaxis and HIV self-testing into HIV programs
   may reduce new infections and decrease time to diagnosis and treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The devastating intraplate earthquake of M-w 7.7 of 26 January, 2001
   took place along the south-dipping reverse fault in the lower crust
   (similar to23 km) of Kutch, Gujarat, India, obliterating some 14,000
   people. The aftershock activity has ensued for three years. We analyzed
   997 aftershocks of Mgreater than or equal to3.0 to study the b value and
   fractal correlation dimensions in time and space. The `b' value is found
   to be 0.8+/-0.03 from the Gutenberg-Richter relation and 0.76+/-0.02
   from the maximum-likelihood, suggesting a typical value for the
   intraplate region. The spatial correlation is 1.71+/-0.02, indicating
   that events are approaching a two-dimensional region. Further, the
   temporal correlation dimension is estimated to be 0.78+/-0.02,
   confirming the structure is mono-fractal in time domain. The depth
   section of b value shows a peak at 15-35 km depth range coinciding with
   the maximum occurrence of aftershocks (similar to 47\%), which is
   inferred as a fluid-filled highly fractured rock matrix with fractures
   of high density. It will be important to note that tomographic results
   also suggest a low Vp, low Vs and a large Poisson's ratio for the same
   depth range, further confirming this inference. Additionally, we have
   studied the variation of D-2(s) and b value with time. During the first
   two months of aftershock activity the results show a marked negative
   correlation between spatial correlation dimension D-2 (large) and b
   value (low), indicating the predominance of large events associated with
   weak clustering. The negative correlation means the stress release along
   faults of a larger surface area. After two months the fractal dimension
   (D-2(s)) and b value suggests a positive correlation implying more
   numerous smaller shocks with stress release along faults of a smaller
   surface area. This would indicate a reduced probability of large
   magnitude earthquakes due to fragmentation of the fault zone.}},

Journal = {{HIV MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Background
   We compared morbidities in HIV-1-infected patients before and after the
   introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a rural Ugandan cohort
   followed from 1990 to 2008. ART was introduced in 2004.
   Methods
   Random-effects Poisson regression models were used to estimate incidence
   rates of World Health Organization (WHO) stage-defining diseases in
   HIV-infected individuals aged 13 years or older with known
   seroconversion dates, and in an age-stratified sample of HIV-negative
   individuals.
   Results
   The most common morbid event was bacterial pneumonia, with an incidence
   of 7.4/100 person-years (pyr) among 309 HIV seroconverters and 1.3/100
   pyr among 348 HIV-negative participants {[}hazard ratio (HR) 5.64; 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 3.6-8.8]. Among seroconverters, the incidence
   of the acquisition of any WHO stage-defining disease rose from 14.4/100
   pyr (95\% CI 11.1-18.6) in 1990-1998 to 46.0/100 pyr (95\% CI 37.7-56.0)
   in 1999-2003. Following the introduction of ART, the incidence among
   seroconverters declined to 36.4/100 pyr (95\% CI 27.1-48.9) in 2004-2005
   and to 28.3/100 pyr (95\% CI 21.2-37.8) in 2006-2008. At the individual
   level, a higher rate of acquiring any WHO stage-defining disease was
   independently associated with lower CD4 cell count, longer duration of
   HIV infection and older age. In addition, individuals who had been on
   ART for longer than 12 months had a substantially lower rate of any WHO
   stage disease than those not yet on ART (adjusted HR 0.35; 95\% CI
   0.2-0.6).
   Conclusion
   Morbidity in HIV-positive participants decreased following the
   introduction of ART, and this decline was more marked with increasing
   duration on ART. The benefits of decreased HIV-related morbidity from
   ART lend support to urgent efforts to ensure universal access to early
   diagnosis of HIV infection and to ART, especially in rural Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Food insecurity (FI), defined as inadequate access to affordable and
   quality nutrition, has negative health consequences. FI and violence
   share similar root causes. The aim of this study was to determine the
   association of FI with gunshot injury (GSI) incidence.
   Methods
   We performed a retrospective review of all patients from 2012 to 2018
   who sustained a GSI. Food access data was abstracted from the US
   Department of Agriculture. We analyzed the impact of FI, low food access
   (LA), and low food access with no vehicle (LANV) on the incidence of GSI
   using Poisson regression. We also compared high-risk zip codes for GSI,
   FI, LA, and LANV using geospatial analysis.
   Results
   There were 1700 patients in our cohort from 33 different zip codes. The
   median incidence of GSI per zip code was 142 (85-164); 5 zip codes
   comprised 50\% of all GSI events. FI (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] 4.05,
   95\% CI 3.98-4.13, P < .0001), LA (IRR 2.97, 95\% CI 2.92-3.03. P <
   .0001), and LANV (IRR 2.58, 95\% CI 2.55-2.62, P < .0001) were
   significant predictors of GSI incidence. The FI model was superior to
   the LA and LANV models. Geospatial analysis demonstrated that both FI (P
   < .0001) and LANV (P < .0001) were significantly associated with GSI,
   while LA was not (P > .05).
   Conclusion
   FI is an independent risk factor for GSI incidence. Additionally, a
   majority of GSI events occur in a minority of communities. These data
   provide a novel opportunity for social services to guide future violence
   prevention strategies.}},

Title = {{Impact of migration from an illicit drug scene on hospital outcomes
   among people who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada}},

Abstract = {{Introduction and Aims People who use illicit drugs (PWUD) are vulnerable
   to an array of negative health outcomes, and increased hospital services
   utilisation. PWUD are also a transient population which poses challenges
   to the provision of optimal health care. The objective of this study was
   to identify out-migration patterns from Vancouver's Downtown Eastside
   (DTES), a neighbourhood where services for PWUD are concentrated, and to
   estimate the impact of these patterns on hospitalisation events among
   PWUD.
   Design and Methods Data were collected through three prospective cohorts
   of PWUD in Vancouver, which were linked with health administrative data.
   Latent class growth analysis was used to define migration trajectory
   groups. Poisson regression was used to estimate the effect of migration
   patterns on hospitalisation events.
   Results A total of 1180 participants were included in the study. Four
   latent classes were identified: early migration out (243, 20.6\%);
   frequent revisit (112, 9.5\%); late migration out (219, 18.6\%); and
   consistently living in the DTES (606, 51.4\%). Compared with those who
   consistently lived in the DTES, participants in the early migration out
   group had lower hospitalisation events (adjusted rate ratio = 0.65; 95\%
   confidence interval: 0.48-0.90).
   Discussion and Conclusion We found that PWUD who migrated out of the
   DTES early had lower hospitalisation events compared to those who
   consistently lived in the DTES, which may be a function of lesser
   addiction severity among this trajectory group. These findings
   underscore a need to provide transitional health and social service
   supports for other trajectory groups in an effort to minimise
   hospitalisation for preventable causes.}},

Abstract = {{A physical model for the footwall slope of Nanfen open-pit mine, China
   was established using a selfdeveloped deep geological engineering
   disaster model test system. A thermosensitive similar material,
   paraffin, was selected to simulate a weak structural plane in the slope
   to reproduce the landslide process. From an experimental perspective,
   the variation trend of shear strength parameters of weak structural
   plane and the mechanical support characteristics of NPR (negative
   Poisson's ratio) anchor cable under the condition of a large landslide
   deformation and failure were examined. The results of this model test
   showed that slope failure has four distinct stages: (1) soil compaction
   stage, (2) crack generation stage, (3) crack propagation stage, and (4)
   sliding plane transfixion stage. According to the test results, the rock
   mechanics parameters of weak surface in the footwall slope of Nanfen
   open-pit mine were calculated. The cohesion is approximately 1.35 x
   10(5) Pa, and the internal friction angle is approximately 6.33 degrees.
   During slope failure, the NPR anchor cable experiences a large
   deformation but no damage occurs, indicating that the NPR anchor cable
   can be continuously monitored and reinforced during the deformation and
   failure of landslide. The stress characteristics of NPR anchor cables
   during the test are consistent with the monitoring results of Newtonian
   force at the landslide site, proving that NPR anchor cables are
   effective and reasonable in landslide monitoring and early warning. (C)

Abstract = {{Cellular structures with hexagonal unit cells show a high degree of
   flexibility in design. Based on the geometry of the unit cells, highly
   orthotropic structures, structures with negative Poisson's ratios,
   structures with high strain capability in a particular direction, or
   other desirable characteristics may be designed. Much of the prior work
   on cellular structures is based on hexagonal honeycomb-like unit cells,
   without any inclusions. A companion paper to the current paper presented
   a vision of cellular honeycomb-like structures with diverse inclusions
   or internal features within the unit cells (such as contact elements
   resulting in stiffening behavior, buckling beams resulting in softening
   behavior, hi-stable elements producing negative stiffness or viscous
   dashpots producing dissipative behavior). That paper further went into
   details on linear springs as the most fundamental of inclusions.
   In the present paper, a buckling beam and viscous dashpots are used as
   inclusions in the basic pin-jointed rigid-walled hexagonal unit cell.
   The buckling beam provides the cell with a high initial stiffness and
   load carrying capability. At loads beyond the critical buckling load,
   the unit cell softens (while still retaining the ability to carry a
   ``design{''} load), and undergoes large deformation under incremental
   load. The viscous dampers undergo a correspondingly large stroke
   resulting in high dissipative capability and loss factor under harmonic
   or transient disturbance beyond the design load. In the paper, an
   analysis and design study of the cell behavior with variation in unit
   cell geometric parameters, buckling beam parameters and viscous dashpot
   parameters is presented. The analytical results in the paper are
   validated against ANSYS Finite Element results. Further, a prototype
   unit cell with an aluminum internal buckling beam and viscous dashpots
   is fabricated and tested under static and dynamic loads in an Instron
   machine. Good correlation is observed between the tests, the FE results
   and the analytical simulations when accounting for the non-linear
   behavior of the viscous dashpot used in the tests.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Systematic engineering of components that employ metamaterials has
   expanded the mechanical design field in recent years. Yet, topology
   optimization remains a burdensome tool to utilize within a systematic
   engineering paradigm. In this work, the design of a metamaterial shear
   beam for a nonpneumatic wheel using a systematic, two-level design
   approach is discussed. A top-level design process is used to determine
   the geometric and effective material properties of the shear beam, and
   linking functions are established and validated for the design of a
   shear layer mesoscale structure. At the metamaterial design level,
   innovative homogenization and topology optimization methods are employed
   to determine a set of locally optimal geometric designs for the shear
   layer. One geometry, the auxetic honeycomb, is shown to be an optimum to
   the minimum volume topology optimization problem for materials subjected
   to pure shear boundary conditions. As such, this geometry is identified
   as a candidate for the shear layer.}},

Abstract = {{Objective There is an urgent need to understand high HIV-infection rates
   among young women in sub-Saharan Africa. While age-disparate
   partnerships have been characterised with high-risk sexual behaviours,
   the mechanisms through which these partnerships may increase HIV-risk
   are not fully understood. This study assessed the association between
   age-disparate partnerships and herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2)
   infection, a factor known to increase HIV-infection risk.
   Methods Cross-sectional face-to-face questionnaire data, and laboratory
   HSV-2 and HIV antibody data were collected among a representative sample
   in the 2014/2015 household survey of the HIV Incidence Provincial
   Surveillance System in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Among 15-24-year-old
   women who reported having ever had sex (n=1550), the association between
   age-disparate partnerships (ie, male partner >= 5 years older) and HSV-2
   antibody status was assessed using multivariable Poisson regression
   models with robust variance. Analyses were repeated among HIV-negative
   women.
   Results HSV-2 prevalence was 55\% among 15-24-year-old women. Women who
   reported an age-disparate partnership with their most recent partner
   were more likely to test HSV-2 positive compared with women with
   age-similar partners (64\% vs 51\%; adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR):1.19
   (95\% CI 1.07 to 1.32, p<0.01)). HSV-2 prevalence was also significantly
   higher among HIV-negative women who reported age-disparate partnerships
   (51\% vs 40 \%; aPR:1.25 (95\% CI 1.05 to 1.50, p=0.014)).
   Conclusions Results indicate that age-disparate partnerships are
   associated with a greater risk of HSV-2 among young women. These
   findings point towards an additional mechanism through which
   age-disparate partnerships could increase HIV-infection risk.
   Importantly, by increasing the HSV-2 risk, age-disparate partnerships
   have the potential to increase the HIV-infection risk within subsequent
   partnerships, regardless of the partner age-difference in those
   relationships.}},

Abstract = {{3D printed, stimuli-responsive materials that reversibly actuate between
   programmed shapes are promising for applications ranging from biomedical
   implants to soft robotics. However, current 3D printing of reversible
   actuators significantly limits the range of possible shapes and/or shape
   responses because they couple the print path to mathematically
   determined director profiles to elicit a desired shape change. Here, we
   report a reactive 3D-printing method that decouples printing and
   shape-programming steps, enabling a broad range of complex architectures
   and virtually any arbitrary shape changes. This method involves first
   printing liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) precursor solution into a
   catalyst bath, producing complex architectures defined by printing.
   Shape changes are then programmed through mechanical deformation and UV
   irradiation. Upon heating and cooling, the LCE reversibly shape-shifts
   between printed and programmed shapes, respectively. The potential of
   this method was demonstrated by programming a variety of arbitrary shape
   changes in a single printed material, producing auxetic LCE structures
   and symmetry-breaking shape changes in LCE sheets.}},

Abstract = {{The paper moves from a technological process developed in previous works
   to produce chiral honeycombs made of thin composite laminates. Such
   approach is applied in this work to manufacture the morphing ribs for a
   variable camber wing-box. The specifications for such components are
   obtained by developing a finite element model of a demonstrator, which
   is designed taking into account aeroelastic performances, structural,
   and technological issues. In the first part of the paper, the design of
   such a demonstrator is presented and the role of composite chiral ribs
   with auxetic behavior is outlined. Production, testing, and numerical
   studies of manufacturing trials are performed to assess the
   technological process applied to small-sized chiral units made of
   different materials, to investigate their mechanical properties, and to
   validate a numerical approach for design and analysis. A complete chiral
   composite rib is then produced and tests are carried out to verify the
   overall structural response and to validate the numerical approach. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women of
   reproductive age in Thailand. However, information on the prevalence and
   correlates of anogenital HPV infection in Thailand is sparse.
   Methods: HPV genotype information, reproductive factors, sexual
   behavior, other STI and clinical information, and cervical cytology and
   histology were assessed at enrollment among one thousand two hundred and
   fifty-six (n = 1,256) HIV negative women aged 20-37 from Thailand
   enrolled in a prospective study of the natural history of HPV. The
   type-specific prevalence of HPV was estimated using cervical swab
   specimens from healthy women and women with a diagnosis of CIN 2/3 at
   baseline. Prevalence ratios (95\% CI) were estimated using Poisson
   regression to quantify the association of demographic, behavioral, and
   clinical correlates with prevalent HPV infection.
   Results: Overall, 307 (24.6\%) and 175 (14.0\%) of women were positive
   for any HPV type and any HR-HPV type, respectively; the most common
   types were 72, 52, 62, and 16. Among women diagnosed with CIN 2/3 at
   enrollment (n = 11), the most prevalent HPV types were 52 and 16. In
   multivariate analysis, HPV prevalence at enrollment was higher among
   women with: long-term combined oral contraceptive use, a higher number
   of lifetime sexual partners, a prior Chlamydia infection, and a current
   diagnosis of Bacterial Vaginosis.
   Conclusion: The study findings provide important information that can be
   used in the evaluation of primary and secondary interventions designed
   to reduce the burden of cervical cancer in Thailand.}},

Abstract = {{Background Deaths by suicide can increase during infectious disease
   outbreaks. This study analysed suspected suicide rates in 2020 relative
   to 2015-19 to assess any early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in
   Queensland, Australia.
   Methods We analysed data from the interim Queensland Suicide Register
   (iQSR), a state-wide real-time suicide surveillance system, using an
   interrupted time-series design. The data source for the iQSR is the Form
   1 police report of a death to a coroner. Two QSR staff independently
   classed the probability of a death by suicide as possible, probable, or
   beyond reasonable doubt. The analysis included the probable or beyond
   reasonable doubt categories as suspected suicides. The primary outcome
   was the monthly suspected suicide rate. We applied Poisson and negative
   binomial regressions to assess whether Queensland's Public Health
   Emergency Declaration on Jan 29, 2020, affected suspected suicides from
   Feb 1 to Aug 31, 2020. Secondary outcomes included absolute or relative
   changes in police-reported motives of recent unemployment, financial
   problems, domestic violence, and relationship breakdown.
   Findings 3793 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted
   monthly rate of 14.85 deaths per 100 000 people (from Jan 1, 2015, to
   Jan 31, 2020) before the declaration, and 443 suspected suicides were
   recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 14.07 deaths per 100 000
   people (Feb 1, 2020, onwards) after the declaration. An interrupted
   timeseries Poisson regression model unadjusted (rate ratio {[}RR] 0.94,
   95\% CI 0.82-1.06) and adjusted for overdispersion, seasonality, and
   pre-exposure trends (RR 1.02, 95\% CI 0.83-1.25) indicated no evidence
   of a change in suspected suicide rates. We found no absolute or relative
   increases in the motives for suspected suicides, including recent
   unemployment, financial problems, relationship breakdown, or domestic
   violence from February to August, 2020, compared with the pre-exposure
   period.
   Interpretation There does not yet appear to be an overall change in the
   suspected suicide rate in the 7 months since Queensland declared a
   public health emergency. Despite this, COVID-19 has contributed to some
   suspected suicides in Queensland. Ongoing community spread and
   increasing death rates of COVID-19, and its impact on national economies
   and mental health, reinforces the need for governments to maintain the
   monitoring and reporting of suicide mortality in real time.}},

Journal = {{EATING BEHAVIORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{38}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been
   linked to negative health behaviors in adulthood, few studies have
   investigated if the impact continues until late adulthood. We examined
   the association between ACEs and fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) among
   older adults in Japan.
   Methods: Data came from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study
   (JAGES), 2013 in which 24,271 individuals aged >= 65 years participated.
   The number of ACEs was calculated (0, 1 and >= 2) while low FVI was
   defined as consuming fruit and vegetables less than once a day. A
   sex-stratified multilevel Poisson regression analysis was used to
   investigate the association between ACEs and low FVI.
   Results: Among men, 35.4\% reported at least one ACE while the
   corresponding figure for women was 30.6\%. Compared to those without
   ACEs, the prevalence ratios for low FVI among those who reported >= 2
   ACEs were 1.51 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.30-1.75) for women
   and 1.28 (95\% CI = 1.14-1.44) for men after adjusting for age and
   childhood economic hardship. Although these associations were attenuated
   after adjusting for socio-demographic and health-related variables, the
   link between ACEs and low FVI remained statistically significant among
   women. Of the seven individual forms of ACE, psychological neglect was
   significantly associated with low FVI (PR = 1.16, 95\% CI = 1.03-1.31)
   among women in the final model.
   Conclusions: ACEs are associated with low FVI among older Japanese
   adults. Our results suggest that the detrimental effect of ACEs on
   health behavior may stretch across the life course.}},

Abstract = {{The role of economic resources, distribution of providers, and
   demography may explain part of the variability found in hip arthroplasty
   in international surveys. We aimed to investigate the influence of
   ageing index, health budget, and density of orthopaedic surgeons in the
   regional variability of the primary and revision THR rate in Spain,
   where regions decide on the allocation of their health budget. Inpatient
   database of hip procedures for years 1997 to 2011 was obtained from the
   Spanish Ministry of Health, segregated for each of the 17 regional
   health services in Spain. Crude and adjusted rates (direct method with
   total Spanish population per year) were calculated and used as dependent
   variables. Ageing index, Health Expenditure of Gross Domestic Product
   (GDP), and number of orthopaedic surgeons per region were used as
   independent variables. Negative binomial regression analysis model and
   Poisson regression were calculated to estimate the risk contribution of
   the ecological variables.
   A total of 425,914 hip procedures, with 367,489 primary (mean crude rate
   = 124 x 10(5) inhabitants/year) and 58,425 revision hips (21 x 10(5)
   inhabitants/year) were included in the analysis. Regional variability
   was higher than expected in THR in Spain, despite a universal coverage
   health system in which equity may be challenged in the administration of
   hip arthroplasty. This was found particularly for primary THR. When hip
   replacement rates were adjusted for sex and age, the regional ageing
   index, the density of orthopaedic surgeons and the regional health
   budget could only partially explain risk ratio changes.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives-In the past, evidence on the negative consequences of
   workplace bullying has been limited to cross sectional studies of self
   reported bullying. In this study, these consequences were examined
   prospectively by focusing on sickness absence in hospital staff.
   Methods-The Poisson regression analyses of medically certified spells
   (greater than or equal to 4 days) and self certified spells (1-3 days)
   of sickness absence, relating to bullying and other predictors of
   health, were based on a cohort of 674 male and 4981 female hospital
   employees aged 19-63 years. Data on sickness absence were gathered from
   employers' registers. Bullying and other predictors of health were
   measured by a questionnaire survey.
   Results-302 (5\%) of the employees reported being victims of bullying.
   They did not differ from the other employees in terms of sex, age,
   occupation, type of job contract, hours of work, income, smoking,
   alcohol consumption, or physical activity. Victims of bullying had
   higher body mass and prevalence of chronic disease, and their rates of
   medically and self certified spells of sickness absence were 1.5 (95\%
   confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.3 to 1.7) and 1.2 (1.1 to 1.4) times
   higher than those of the rest of the staff. The rate ratios remained
   significant after adjustment for demographic data, occupational
   background, behaviour involving risks to health, baseline health status,
   and sickness absence.
   Conclusion-Workplace bullying is associated with an increase in the
   sickness absenteeism of the hospital staff. Targets of bullying seem not
   to belong to any distinct group with certain demographic characteristics
   or occupational background.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective prevention
   tool for people at substantial risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency
   virus (HIV). To monitor the current state of PrEP use among men who have
   sex with men (MSM), we report on willingness to use PrEP and PrEP
   utilization. To assess whether the MSM subpopulations at highest risk
   for infection have indications for PrEP according to the 2014 clinical
   guidelines, we estimated indications for PrEP for MSM by demographics.
   Methods. We analyzed data from the 2014 cycle of the National HIV
   Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) system among MSM who tested HIV negative
   in NHBS and were currently sexually active. Adjusted prevalence ratios
   and 95\% confidence intervals were estimated from log-linked Poisson
   regression with generalized estimating equations to explore differences
   in willingness to take PrEP, PrEP use, and indications for PrEP.
   Results. Whereas over half of MSM said they were willing to take PrEP,
   only about 4\% reported using PrEP. There was no difference in
   willingness to take PrEP between black and white MSM. PrEP use was
   higher among white compared with black MSM and among those with greater
   education and income levels. Young, black MSM were less likely to have
   indications for PrEP compared with young MSM of other races/ethnicities.
   Conclusions. Young, black MSM, despite being at high risk of HIV
   acquisition, may not have indications for PrEP under the current
   guidelines. Clinicians may need to consider other factors besides risk
   behaviors such as HIV incidence and prevalence in subgroups of their
   communities when considering prescribing PrEP.}},

Title = {{Perceived discrimination in health services and associated factors in
   Manaus Metropolitan Region, Brazil: a cross-sectional population-based
   study}},
Journal = {{ETHNICITY \& HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Discrimination is the differentiated treatment of
   individuals due to prejudgments. Discriminatory practices in health care
   result in negative effects on patients' health. In Brazil, skin color
   represents the main form of racial discrimination, which may have an
   impact on the accessibility and quality of health care. The Brazilian
   Amazon lacks investigations on this topic at the population level. This
   study aims to estimate the prevalence of perceived discrimination in
   health services and associated factors in the Manaus Metropolitan
   Region, state of Amazonas, Brazil. Design: A population-based
   cross-sectional study was conducted with a probabilistic sample of
   adults interviewed in 2015. The associated factors were investigated by
   calculating the prevalence ratio (PR) using Poisson regression with
   robust variance. Results: A total of 4,001 participants were included.
   The overall prevalence of perceived discrimination was 12.9\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 11.8-13.9\%). When compared to the reference
   categories, women (PR = 1.43; 95\%CI: 1.20-1.70), individuals with brown
   skin color (Brazilian mixed race; PR = 1.33; 95\%CI: 1.04-1.71), people
   who suffer from hypertension (PR = 1.27;95\%CI: 1.03-1.57), and people
   who frequently used health services (p <= 0.03) experienced more
   discrimination from health professionals. Conclusions: The prevalence of
   perceived discrimination in health services in Manaus Metropolitan
   Region is frequent and is associated with ethnic, social and
   health-related factors. Investments in inclusive public health policies
   and a better quality of health assistance are required to tackle this
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{African Americans exhibit a lower degree of nocturnal blood pressure
   (BP) dipping compared with Whites, but the reasons for reduced BP
   dipping in this group are not fully understood. The aim of this study
   was to identify psychosocial factors associated with BP dipping in a
   population-based cohort of African Americans.
   This cross-sectional study included 668 Jackson Heart Study (JHS)
   participants with valid 24-hour ambulatory BP data and complete data on
   psychosocial factors of interest including stress, negative emotions,
   and psychosocial resources (e.g., perceived support). The association of
   each psychosocial factor with BP dipping percentage and nondipping
   status (defined as < 10\% BP dipping) was assessed using linear and
   Poisson regression models, respectively, with progressive adjustment for
   demographic, socioeconomic, biomedical, and behavioral factors.
   The prevalence of nondipping was 64\%. Higher depressive symptoms,
   higher hostility, and lower perceived social support were associated
   with a lower BP dipping percentage in unadjusted models and after
   adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and mean 24-hour systolic BP
   (P < 0.05). Only perceived support was associated with BP dipping
   percentage in fully adjusted models. Also, after full multivariable
   adjustment, the prevalence ratio for nondipping BP associated with 1 SD
   (7.1 unit) increase in perceived support was 0.93 (95\% CI: 0.88-0.99).
   No other psychosocial factors were associated with nondipping status.
   Lower perceived support was associated with reduced BP dipping in this
   study. The role of social support as a potentially modifiable
   determinant of nocturnal BP dipping warrants further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES : Endoscopic surveillance is recommended for patients with
   Barrett's esophagus (BE). However, it remains unclear if all BE patients
   benefit from long-term surveillance. We investigated the risk of
   esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in BE patients in relation to number of
   successive endoscopies, years of follow-up, and calendar year.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of male veterans with
   newly diagnosed BE during 20042009 with follow-up until 30 September
   2011. EAC was verified using detailed structured electronic medical
   records reviews. We used Poisson regression to determine incidence
   rates, rate ratios (RR), and corresponding 95\% confidence intervals
   (CI) for EAC according to number of successive endoscopies, years of
   follow-up independent of number of follow-up endoscopies, and calendar
   year of BE diagnosis.
   RESULTS: Among 28,561 male patients with BE, 406 developed EAC during
   140,499 person-years of follow-up (median 4.9 years). EAC incidence
   rates increased with each additional endoscopy following a previous
   negative endoscopy (RR per additional endoscopy, 1.43; 95\% CI,
   1.25-1.64). Compared to the EAC incidence rate at the 1st follow-up EGD,
   the EAC incidence rate at the 5th follow-up EGD was ninefold higher
   (adjusted RR, 8.82; 95\% CI, 4.90-15.9). EAC incidence was highest at
   the first year of follow-up (5.34 per 1,000 person-years); however, EAC
   rates starting from the second follow-up year increased during
   successive years of follow up. Compared to the EAC incidence rate in the
   2nd year of follow-up, the EAC incidence rate was 1.5-fold higher in
   EGDs conducted >= 5 years after the index BE date (adjusted RR, 1.49;
   95\% CI, 1.07-2.10). In contrast, we found no significant change in EAC
   incidence rates by calendar year.
   CONCLUSIONS: Persistence of non-neoplastic BE on multiple consecutive
   endoscopies was not associated with lower EAC risk. These findings argue
   against discontinuation of endoscopic surveillance in patients with
   persistent nondysplastic BE after multiple negative endoscopies.}},

   type 2 diabetes. We aimed to systematically screen for drugs that
   interact with the five most commonly used secretagogues-glipizide,
   glyburide, glimepiride, repaglinide, and nateglinide-to cause serious
   hypoglycemia.
   Methods: We screened 400 drugs frequently coprescribed with the
   secretagogues as candidate interacting precipitants. We first predicted
   the drug-drug interaction potential based on the pharmacokinetics of
   each secretagogue-precipitant pair. We then performed
   pharmacoepidemiologic screening for each secretagogue of interest, and
   for metformin as a negative control, using an administrative claims
   database and the self-controlled case series design. The overall rate
   ratios (RRs) and those for four predefined risk periods were estimated
   using Poisson regression. The RRs were adjusted for multiple estimation
   using semi-Bayes method, and then adjusted for metformin results to
   distinguish native effects of the precipitant from a drug-drug
   interaction.
   Results: We predicted 34 pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with the
   secretagogues, nine moderate and 25 weak. There were 140 and 61
   secretagogue-precipitant pairs associated with increased rates of
   serious hypoglycemia before and after the metformin adjustment,
   respectively. The results from pharmacokinetic prediction correlated
   poorly with those from pharmacoepidemiologic screening.
   Conclusions: The self-controlled case series design has the potential to
   be widely applicable to screening for drug-drug interactions that lead
   to adverse outcomes identifiable in healthcare databases. Coupling
   pharmacokinetic prediction with pharmacoepidemiologic screening did not
   notably improve the ability to identify drug-drug interactions in this
   case.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated character and distribution of the gas hydrate zone in
   the western part of the Ulleung Basin in the East Sea (Japan Sea) from
   seismic data using stochastic sparse spike deconvolution, analysis of
   frequencies, and acoustic-elastic coupled full-waveform inversion. The
   presence of gas hydrates is primarily indicated by a bottom-simulating
   reflector (BSR) with negative polarity at approximately 240-250 ms below
   the seafloor. The instantaneous frequency section defines a
   high-frequency anomaly above the BSR underlain by a less clear
   low-frequency anomaly. Sparse spike deconvolution indicates that the BSR
   occurs horizontally along the boundary between the high- and
   low-frequency anomalies. Compared to well logs obtained from the
   seafloor through the BSR, the high-frequency anomaly, maximally 50 ms
   thick (ca. 45 m), appears to outline the hydrate-bearing zone. The
   results from full-waveform inversion appear to delineate the
   hydrate-bearing zone and the underlying gas-bearing zone, although their
   depth ranges do not coincide accurately with those inferred from well
   logs. The hydrate-bearing zone is characterized by an increase in both
   p- and s-wave velocities, while the gas-bearing zone is marked by a
   decrease in p-wave velocity. The very narrow free gas zone is less than
   30 m thick and appears to be concentrated immediately below the gas
   hydrate stability zone. The hydrate-bearing zone is also defined by
   decreased Poisson's ratio which suggests appreciable variations of the
   hydrate-bearing zone in thickness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Epidemiologic analyses of sarcoma are limited by the
   heterogeneity and rarity of the disease. Utilizing population-based
   surveillance data enabled us to evaluate the contribution of census
   tract-level socioeconomic status (CT-SES) and race/ethnicity on sarcoma
   incidence rates.
   Methods: We utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
   program to evaluate associations between CT-SES and race/ ethnicity on
   the incidence rates of sarcoma. Incidence rate ratios and 99\%
   confidence intervals were estimated from quasi-Poisson models. All
   models were stratified by broad age groups (pediatric: <20 years, adult:
   20-65 years, older adult: 65thorn years) and adjusted for sex, age, and
   year of diagnosis. Within each age group, we conducted analyses
   stratified by somatic genome (fusion-positive and fusion-negative
   sarcomas) and for subtypes with >200 total cases. AP value less than
   0.01 was considered statistically significant.
   Results: We included 55,415 sarcoma cases in 35 sarcoma subtype-age
   group combinations. Increasing CT-SES was statistically significantly
   associated with 11 subtype-age group combinations, primarily in the
   older age group strata (8 subtypes), whereas malignant peripheral nerve
   sheath tumors in adults were associated with decreasing CT-SES. Nearly
   every sarcoma subtype-age group combination displayed racial/ethnic
   disparities in incidence that were independent of CT-SES.
   Conclusions: We found race/ethnicity to be more frequently associated
   with sarcoma incidence than CT-SES. Our findings suggest that genetic
   variation associated with ancestry may play a stronger role than
   area-level SES-related factors in the etiology of sarcoma.
   Impact: These findings provide direction for future etiologic studies of
   sarcomas.}},

Abstract = {{Background This study investigates whether alcohol use predicts the
   periodontal pocket development over an 11-year follow-up period.
   Methods The study participants' periodontal condition was examined both
   in the Health 2000 and 2011 Surveys (BRIF8901). Participants were aged
   30 to 65 years, dentate, periodontally healthy, and did not have
   diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis in 2000. Periodontal outcome measures
   in 2011 were the number of teeth with deepened (>= 4 mm) periodontal
   pockets and the presence of deepened periodontal pockets. The exposure
   in 2000 was alcohol use (amount {[}g/week], frequency {[}any alcohol or
   different beverages]). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95\% confidence
   intervals (CI) were estimated using negative binomial regression model
   and Poisson regression model with a robust variance estimator.
   Results Overall, the amount of alcohol use or use over the risk limit in
   2000 was inconsistently associated with the development of periodontal
   pockets (IRRs varied from 0.6 to 1.0). The frequency of alcohol use (any
   alcohol or different beverages) had an inconsistent association with the
   presence of periodontal pockets (IRRs varied from 0.5 to 1.2) while
   there was an inverse association with the number of teeth with
   periodontal pockets. Among smokers, there were no clear associations
   between any of the exposures and either of the outcomes. The same was
   found among non-smokers except an inverse association was found between
   frequency of alcohol use and the number of teeth with periodontal
   pockets.
   Conclusion Alcohol use was not consistently associated with the
   periodontal pocket development over a period of 11 years.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Recently, pathogen ecology has been recognized as an
   important epidemiological determinant of healthcare-associated
   infections (HAIs). Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most important
   agents known to cause HAIs. It is widespread in healthcare settings and
   exhibits seasonal variations in incidence. Little is known about the
   impact of competition with other hospital pathogens on the incidence of
   A. baumannii infection. Methods: We conducted an ecological study,
   enrolling patients who presented with healthcare-associated bloodstream
   infections (HA-BSIs) from 2005 to 2010 at a 450-bed teaching hospital in
   Brazil. HA-BSIs were said to be present when bacteria or fungi were
   recovered from blood cultures collected at least three days after
   admission. Monthly incidence rates were calculated for all HA-BSIs
   (overall or caused by specific pathogens or groups of pathogens).
   Multivariate Poisson regression models were used to identify the impacts
   of the incidence of several pathogens on the incidence of A. baumannii.
   Results: The overall incidence rate of HA-BSI caused by A. baumannii was
   2.5 per 10,000 patient-days. In the multivariate analysis, the incidence
   of HA-BSI caused by A. baumannii was negatively associated with the
   incidence rates of HA-BSI due to Staphylococcus aureus (rate ratio
   {[}RR]=0.88; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]=0.80-0.97), Enterobacter
   spp. (RR=0.84; 95\% CI=0.74-0.94) and a pool of less common
   gram-negative pathogens. Conclusions: Our results suggest that
   competition between pathogens influences the etiology of HA-BSIs. It
   would be beneficial to take these findings into account in infection
   control policies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Women who inject drugs and who also exchange sex are at
   increased risk for HIV infection, but data on this population in the
   United States remain sparse.
   Methods: This study assessed the prevalence of exchanging sex for money
   or drugs among women who inject drugs using data from the 2009 US
   National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) system. Prevalence of being
   HIV-positive (testing positive in NHBS), HIV-positive-unaware (reporting
   being HIV-negative or unknown status but testing positive in NHBS), and
   risk behaviors and use of services were compared between women who did
   and did not exchange sex. The association between exchange sex and being
   HIV-positive-unaware of the infection was examined using multivariate
   Poisson models with robust standard errors.
   Results: Among 2305 women who inject drugs, 39\% reported receiving
   things like money or drugs from >= 1 male partners in exchange for oral,
   vaginal, or anal sex in the previous 12 months. Women who exchanged sex
   were more likely to be unemployed, homeless, lack health insurance, have
   multiple condomless vaginal or anal sex partners, and receptively share
   syringes. In multivariate analysis, exchange sex was associated with
   being HIV-positive-unaware (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.97, 95\%
   confidence intervals: 1.31 to 2.97).
   Conclusions: Prevalence of exchange sex was high in this population.
   Women who exchange sex were more likely to be socially disadvantaged,
   report sexual and injection risk, and be HIV-positive-unaware. They
   represent an important group to reach with HIV prevention, testing, and

Title = {{Community acceptance and HIV sexual risk among gay and bisexual men in a
   `typical' Canadian city}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN SEXUALITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{7-16}},
Abstract = {{Included in Statistics Canada's largest geographical ``peer group,''
   London, Ontario is typical of many midsize Canadian cities. A local
   health forum identified community acceptance and homophobia as key
   factors impacting LGBTQ health; we studied these with regard to
   HIV-related sexual risk in gay and bisexual men. Survey data were
   collected from 201 gay and bisexual men in Middlesex-London, Ontario;
   173 reported their HIV status as negative/unknown and were included in
   this analysis. Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence risk ratios (PRRs)
   were modelled using modified Poisson regression. First, a model was fit
   for non-modifiable sociodemographic and background factors. Community
   factors were then added: social support; internalized homonegativity;
   perceptions of community acceptance of people like oneself (based on
   orientation, racialization, gender identity). Older age was associated
   with decreased risk; other sociodemographic and background factors were
   not. For each 10-year increase in age, prevalence of high-risk sex
   decreased by 24\% (PRR = 0.76; 95\% CI: 0.60, 0.95). Controlling for
   age, we found an interaction between perception of broader community
   acceptance and gay community acceptance of people like oneself. As
   broader community acceptance increased, high-risk sex decreased;
   however, this effect varied depending upon perceptions of gay community
   acceptance, with men feeling most accepted within the gay community
   having the smallest reductions in high-risk sex. This interaction raises
   a series of questions. Among these: How do community norms and
   availability of partners shape sexual risk-taking? Are conventional
   ``contextualized'' measures of sexual risk sufficient, or do they miss
   important risk-mitigation strategies used within gay communities?}},

Journal = {{ACTA ODONTOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To investigate whether receipt of dental services, among
   attenders, reflects variations in dental health or whether and to what
   degree it is associated with socioeconomic status, with irregular or
   regular dental attendance and with the availability of dentists in
   residential areas. Materials and methods. This retrospective
   register-based study followed two Danish cohorts, aged 25 and 40, with a
   dental examination in 2009 (n = 32,351). The dental service data were
   registered during 2005-2009. The number of dental examinations,
   individual preventive services (IPS), tooth extractions, root fillings
   and composite fillings were analyzed in relation to socioeconomic
   status, irregular/regular dental attendance, inhabitant/dentist ratio
   and to DMFT at age 15 (DMFT15) and change in DMFT (Delta DMFT) from age
   15 to age 25 and age 40, respectively. Poisson regression and negative
   binomial regression analyses were used. Results. The variations in
   number of services received in the study population were small (SD =
   0.2-2.7). However, with a few exceptions, high levels of DMFT15 and
   DDMFT were associated with receipt of more dental services.
   Socioeconomically-privileged individuals received more dental
   examinations but fewer tooth extractions, root fillings and composite
   fillings compared to disadvantaged persons, when controlled for dental
   health levels. Irregular attenders received fewer IPS and composite
   fillings but had more extractions compared to regular attenders.
   Conclusions. Variations in dental care services were found to reflect
   variations in dental health, but the variations were also related to
   individual socioeconomic status, residential area and dental attendance
   patterns.}},

Title = {{Risk of breast cancer among daughters of mothers with diabetes: a
   population-based cohort study}},
Journal = {{BREAST CANCER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Diabetes during pregnancy is related to enhanced fetal
   growth, which has been associated with increased breast cancer risk.
   Whether daughters of mothers with a diagnosis of diabetes have an
   increased risk of breast cancer is not known.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of daughters of
   mothers with diabetes by linkage of the Swedish Multigeneration,
   Cause-of-Death and Patient Register between 1952 and 2005. Breast cancer
   cases were ascertained by linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register
   between 1958 and 2005. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of breast
   cancer were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution for the observed
   cases.
   Results: We identified 291,360 daughters of mothers with a diagnosis of
   diabetes before or after birth between 1952 and 2005. Among the
   daughters, 7,956 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed between 1964 and
   2005. The total time of follow-up was 12,173,821 person years. The
   expected number of breast cancer cases was 9,204, resulting in an SIR of
   0.86 (95\% CI, 0.85 to 0.88). The decrease in risk associated with
   maternal diabetes was stronger for premenopausal (< 55 years of age)
   than postmenopausal (>= 55 years of age) breast cancer (SIR 0.83 and
   0.91, respectively). Among daughters of mothers with diabetes, a history
   of breast cancer in the mother increased the risk of breast cancer in
   the daughter (SIR 1.43, 1.32 to 1.54).
   Conclusions: Daughters of mothers with a lifetime history of diabetes
   were at a decreased risk of breast cancer. The strongest negative
   association was found among premenopausal breast cancer.}},

Title = {{Workload of pharmacists and the performance of pharmacy services}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   To evaluate the influence of pharmacists' dispensing workload (PDW) on
   pharmacy services as measured by prescription suggestion rate (PSR) and
   dispensing error rate (DER).
   Method
   This was an observational study in northern and southern Taiwan's two
   largest medical centers, from 2012 to 2018. We calculated monthly PDW as
   number of prescriptions divided by number of pharmacist working days. We
   used monthly PSR and DER as outcome indicators for pharmacists' review
   and dispensing services, respectively. We used Poisson regression model
   with generalized estimation equation methods to evaluate the influence
   of PDW on PSR and DER.
   Results
   The monthly mean of 463,587 (SD 32,898) prescriptions yielded mean PDW,
   PSR and DER of 52 (SD 3) prescriptions per pharmacist working days, 30
   (SD 7) and 8 (SD 2) per 10,000 prescriptions monthly, respectively.
   There was significant negative impact of PDW on PSR (adjusted rate
   ratio, aRR: 0.9786; 95\%CI: 0.9744-0.9829) and DER (aRR: 0.9567; 95\%CI:
   0.9477-0.9658). Stratified analyses by time periods (2012-2015 and
   2016-2018) revealed the impact of PDW on PSR to be similar in both
   periods; but with positive association between PDW and DER in the more
   recent one (aRR: 1.0086, 95\%CI: 1.0003-1.0169).
   Conclusions
   Reduced pharmacist workload was associated with re-allocation of
   pharmacy time to provide prescription suggestions and, more recently,
   decrease dispensing errors. Continuous efforts to maintain appropriate
   workload for pharmacists are recommended to ensure prescription quality.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. No study has focused on the nationwide epidemiology of
   severe and fatal rattlesnake bites during the last 25 years. We examined
   rates and temporal trends of severe and fatal rattlesnake bites across
   the United States. Our hypothesis was that nationwide annual rates of
   both severe and fatal outcomes from rattlesnake bites have remained
   unchanged over time. Methods. This study retrospectively analyzed all
   human rattlesnake bites published in the Annual Reports of the American
   Association of Poison Control Centers from 1983 through 2007. Annual
   rates of severe (major) and fatal rattlesnake bites were calculated
   using the annual number of major outcomes and fatalities as respective
   numerators and the total annual number of single rattlesnake bites
   (exposures) as denominators. Negative binomial and Poisson regressions
   were used to examine trends of severe and fatal rattlesnake bites over
   time. Results. Annually, from 1985 to 2007, the incidence rate of major
   outcomes decreased by 2\% per year (incidence rate ratio = 0.980; CI =
   0.967-0.993), corresponding to an absolute annual rate decrease of two
   major outcomes per 1,000 bites per year. Annual rates of fatalities
   showed no statistically significant change from 1983 through 2007.
   Conclusion. This is the first study to examine rates and trends of
   published severe and fatal rattlesnake bites across the United States
   over the past 25 years. Annual rates of severe rattlesnake bites,
   derived from the published Annual Reports of the American Association of
   Poison Control Centers, have significantly decreased over time, whereas
   rates of fatal rattlesnake bites have remained unchanged.}},

Journal = {{PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{916-923}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Encephalocele is classified as a neural tube defect, but
   questions have been raised regarding whether its epidemiological
   characteristics are similar to those of other neural tube defects.
   DESIGN. We compared characteristics of temporal trends in, and the
   impact of folic acid grain fortification on, the prevalence of
   encephalocele, spina bifida, and anencephaly using data from the
   Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program, a population-based
   birth defects surveillance system. Prevalences of encephalocele, spina
   bifida, and anencephaly were compared by maternal age, gender, race,
   birth weight, ascertainment period (1968-1981, 1982-1993, or 1994-2002),
   and fortification period (1994-1996 {[}prefortification] and 1998-2002
   {[}postfortification]) using prevalence ratios with 95\% confidence
   intervals. Temporal trends were assessed using Poisson and negative
   binomial regression models.
   RESULTS. Prevalence rates of encephalocele (n = 167), spina bifida (n =
   650), and anencephaly (n = 431) were 1.4, 5.5, and 3.7 per 10 000 live
   births, respectively. Encephalocele was similar to anencephaly in
   showing an increased prevalence among girls and multiple gestation
   pregnancies and to spina bifida and anencephaly in an annual prevalence
   decrease between 1968 and 2002 (-1.2\% for encephalocele, -4.2\% for
   spina bifida, and -3.6\% for anencephaly). With fortification,
   prevalence decreased for spina bifida but not significantly for
   encephalocele or anencephaly.
   CONCLUSIONS. Encephalocele shows more similarities to spina bifida or
   anencephaly than it shows differences with respect to characteristics,
   temporal trend, and impact of fortification. Additional studies should
   be done to explore the etiologic heterogeneity of encephalocele using
   better markers of folate status and a wider range of risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{A novel lithium ion battery (LIB) anode material with high capacity is
   found, which is made of cross-linked graphene sheets. The new material,
   named bco-C20, has a 3D honeycomb structure composed of unit cells of 20
   atoms, and exhibits a body-centered orthorhombic crystal structure. The
   thermal, dynamic, and mechanical stabilities of such a material are well
   evaluated by molecular dynamics simulation, phonon dispersion, and
   Born-Huang criteria. As a promising semimetal, bco-C20 possesses a
   unique electronic band structure with cross-linked Dirac nodal-rings.
   The Fermi velocities are from 8.25 x 10(5)m s(-1)to 10.45 x 10(5)m
   s(-1), indicating good electronic transport properties. A comparison
   with most of the 3D carbon materials demonstrates that bco-C20 also has
   the good material properties of high strength and fracture toughness
   that are very close to those of graphene. Furthermore, a negative
   Poisson's ratio of up to -0.25 is very helpful for the new material to
   bear compressive load. Most importantly, as a promising anode material
   in LIBs, bco-C20 has a high theoretical capacity of 893 mA h g(-1), low
   diffusion barrier of 0.02-0.12 eV, average open-circuit voltage of 0.41
   V, and negligible volume change of 3.7\%. Some related properties of
   lithiated bco-C20 are also evaluated and discussed. This study should be
   helpful for expanding the family of 3D carbon materials with
   extraordinary properties as well as their promising applications in
   advanced energy fields.}},

Abstract = {{There is evidence for negative associations between social isolation and
   loneliness and sleep quality in older adults. However, it is unclear to
   what extent these two factors independently affect sleep quality. This
   study examined the simultaneous associations of social isolation and
   loneliness with sleep quality in a longitudinal study of older adults.
   Data were analyzed from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging
   Study in Taiwan collected in 2000 and 2006, involving a cohort of 639
   participants (mean age = 66.14, SD 7.26). Poisson regression models were
   conducted to examine the association of social isolation and/or
   loneliness with sleep quality at follow-up after adjusting for multiple
   confounding variables.
   Univariate analysis showed that sleep quality was inversely associated
   with both social isolation and loneliness. After demographic, health,
   cognitive factors, and depressive symptoms were controlled in
   multivariable analysis, social isolation at the baseline still predicted
   poor sleep quality 6 years later (incident rate ratio, IRR 1.14; 95\% CI
   1.04-1.24; p < 0.01), while the association between loneliness and sleep
   quality was no longer significant (IRR 1.08; 95\% CI 0.94-1.23; p =
   0.27). The results were unchanged when participants who had poor sleep
   quality at the baseline were excluded from the analysis.
   These findings confirm an adverse effect of social isolation on the
   sleep quality of older adults, but indicate that this effect is
   independent of loneliness. Social isolation and loneliness seem to have
   distinct pathways in affecting the sleep quality of older adults.}},

Abstract = {{Background Cancer screening has contributed to downward trends in cancer
   mortality, but is also associated with adverse effects, which highlights
   the importance of promoting the participation based on informed
   decisions.
   Objectives We aimed to describe the use of cancer screening (either in
   organized programmes or as opportunistic screening), awareness of
   organized programmes and perception of its potential benefits and
   adverse effects, depicting possible sex differences.
   Design and methods We evaluated 1624 Portuguese-speaking dwellers, aged
   between 16 and 79 years, through face-to-face interviews. To quantify
   sex differences, adjusted prevalence ratios and respective 95\%
   confidence intervals were computed using Poisson regression.
   Results Among eligible age groups, the lifetime prevalence of screening
   for breast and cervical cancers was 89.8 and 71.9\%, respectively. The
   prevalence was 23.7\% for colorectal cancer and no significant sex
   differences were observed. Prostate cancer screening was reported by
   63.8\% of men. Over half of the participants referred that cancers such
   as prostate, skin, lung and stomach should be screened for, in addition
   to those for which organized programmes are recommended. Reassurance by
   negative results was identified as the main potential benefit of
   screening by nearly one-third of men and women. Anxiety while waiting
   for results was the most mentioned potential adverse effect (60.4\%);
   men refer less often this and financial costs, although statistical
   significance of these results was borderline.
   Conclusions This study provides a benchmark to plan and monitor the
   effects of awareness-raising interventions, as well as for international
   comparisons across countries with different cancer prevention and
   control structures.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Most global maternal deaths occur in Africa and Asia. In
   response, the Millennium Development Goal (MDG-5) calls for a 75\%
   reduction in maternal mortality from 1990 to 2015. To assess the
   potential for progress in MDG-5 in Africa, we examined the
   cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of socioeconomic,
   demographic and population-health factors with maternal mortality rates
   in Africa.
   Methods We used data from global agencies and the published literature
   to identify socioeconomic, demographic and population-health explanatory
   factors that could be correlated with maternal mortality in 49 countries
   of Africa for the years 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005. We used correlation,
   negative binomial and mixed Poisson regression models to investigate
   whether there exist associations between potential explanatory factors
   and maternal mortality.
   Results Some African countries have made substantial progress towards
   achieving MDG-5 while others have fallen behind. Lower gross domestic
   product (GDP) and female enrolment in primary schools, but higher HIV
   prevalence, neonatal mortality rate and total fertility rate, were
   associated with higher maternal mortality.
   Conclusions Maternal mortality rates in African countries appear to be
   declining. The mean maternal mortality ratios in Africa decreased from
   695.82 in 1990 to 562.18 in 2005. Yet some countries are more likely
   than others to achieve MDG-5. Better socioeconomic, demographic and
   population health development appear to be conducive to better maternal
   health in Africa. Sustained efforts on all these fronts will be needed
   to close the gap in maternal survival and achieve MDG-5 in Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Screening programmes for type 2 diabetes inevitably find more people at
   high risk of developing diabetes than people with undiagnosed prevalent
   diabetes. We describe the incidence of diabetes for risk groups
   according to advancement in a screening process.
   In 2001-2006, a diabetes screening programme based on the Danish
   diabetes risk score and measures of HbA(1c) and glucose was carried out
   in Danish general practices. The present study includes 13,249
   individuals with low diabetes risk scores and 22,726 with high diabetes
   risk scores but no diabetes according to WHO 1999 criteria. Seven
   incremental levels of diabetes risk were defined and followed for
   incident diabetes recorded in the Danish National Diabetes Register
   until December 2012. For each group, cumulative diabetes incidence was
   calculated. Incidence rates and rate ratios were estimated by Poisson
   regression analyses.
   After 10 years of follow-up 1,164 new diabetes cases were registered.
   Incidence rates were 1.0, 4.2, 14.5, 28.8 and 52.6 per 1,000
   person-years in individuals at low risk and in those with normal glucose
   tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance and one
   diabetic glucose value, respectively. For each step in the screening
   algorithm, the risk of developing diabetes was higher than in the
   previous step.
   The risk of developing clinical diabetes in people who screen negative
   for diabetes depends on the level of risk stratification at screening,
   even at lower risk levels. This risk increases markedly in the presence
   of impaired glucose regulation. These results can inform policy
   recommendations concerning prevention strategies following screening.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{A recently proposed two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope,
   tetrahex-carbon composed of tetragonal and hexagonal rings in a buckled
   plane, draws scientific research interests due to its remarkable
   mechanical and electronic properties, including ultrahigh strength,
   negative Poisson's ratio, finite direct band gap, and high carrier
   mobility. In this work, a series of carbon nanotubes rolled from this
   new 2D tetrahex-C nanosheet with various size and chirality are studied
   through first-principles density-functional theory calculations. The
   tube diameter is in the range of 4.5-18 angstrom. It is found that the
   smallest thermodynamically stable nanotubes have the diameter of 4.5
   angstrom for zigzag tetrahex-C nanotubes (z-TH-CNTs) and 6.0 angstrom
   for armchair tetrahex-C nanotubes (a-TH-CNTs). The z-TH-CNTs are
   energetically more favorable than the a-TH-CNTs given similar size. The
   single-wall nanotubes have a particular wall thickness which shrinks
   with the decrease of tube size. It is also found that all explored
   nanotubes show semiconducting behavior and HSE predicted band gaps can
   be effectively tuned in the range of 1.84-2.69 eV with size and
   chirality. Large curvature in small z-TH-CNTs alters the band

Abstract = {{Aims We examined whether a current major depressive episode (MDE) at
   baseline predicted crack use and arrests at follow-up among women
   enrolled in drug court. Design Primary analyses used zero-inflated
   Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression
   analyses to predict both yes/no and number of (i) days of crack use and
   (ii) arrests at 4-month follow-up from current (30-day) MDE at baseline.
   Secondary analyses addressed risk conferred by current versus past MDE
   at baseline. Setting/Participants Participants were 261 women in drug
   court. Measurements MDE was assessed using the Diagnostic Interview
   Schedule. Days using crack and number of arrests were assessed using the
   Washington University Risk Behavior Assessment for Women. Findings
   Having a current MDE at baseline predicted likelihood of crack use at
   follow-up, but not days of crack use among those who used. Current MDE
   at baseline did not predict presence or number of arrests at the 4-month
   follow-up. Women with current MDE at baseline were more likely to be
   using crack at follow-up than were those with recent (31+ days to 12
   months) but not current MDE (odds ratio = 5.71); past MDE at baseline
   did not increase risk of crack use. Conclusions Predictors of any versus
   no crack use or arrests appear to differ from predictors of frequency of
   these behaviors. Current major depression, but not past major
   depression, appears to be associated with increased risk of crack use
   among women attending drug court.}},

Abstract = {{To assess trends in HIV-1 incidence and risk factors for seroconversion
   among men who have sex with men (MSM) resident in Rome, Italy, a
   retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted over 25 years.
   Incidence rates and trends were modelled using Poisson regression and
   risk factors were assessed by multivariate Cox models. Of 1,862
   HIV-1-negative individuals, 347 seroconverted during follow-up. HIV-1
   incidence rates increased from 5.2/100 persons/year (p/y) in 1986 (95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 2.3-11.5) to 9.2/00 p/y in 1992 (95\% CI:
   6.4-13.0), decreased to 1.3/100 p/y in 2001 and increased until 2009
   (11.7/100 p/y; 95\% CI: 7.4-18.6). The risk of HIV-1 seroconversion
   increased during the study period in younger MSM (incidence rate ratio
   (IRR) = 17.18; 95\% CI: 9.74-30.32 in 16-32 year-olds and IRR = 5.09;
   95\% CI: 2.92-8.87 in 33-41 year-olds) and in those who acquired
   syphilis (IRR = 7.71; 95\% CI: 5.00-11.88). In contrast, the risk of
   seroconversion decreased among highly educated MSM (IRR = 0.54; 95\% CI:
   0.35-0.82) and those without Italian citizenship (IRR = 0.45; 95\% CI:
   0.28-0.71). The HIV epidemic in MSM living in Rome continues to expand.
   Targeted prevention programmes against sexually transmitted infections
   to enhance knowledge transfer and behavioural skills are urgently
   required.}},

Abstract = {{Background Causes of most birth defects are largely unknown. Genetics,
   maternal factors (e.g., age, smoking) and environmental exposures have
   all been linked to some birth defects, including neural tube, oral
   cleft, limb reduction, and gastroschisis; however, the contribution of
   cumulative exposures across several environmental domains in association
   with these defects is not well understood. Methods The Environmental
   Quality Index (EQI) and its domains (air, water, land, sociodemographic,
   built) were used to estimate county-level cumulative environmental
   exposures from 2006-2010 and matched to birth defects identified from
   Texas Birth Defects Registry and live birth records from births in years
   2007-2010 (N= 1,610,709). Poisson regression models estimated prevalence
   ratios (PR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between
   10 birth defects and the EQI. Results We observed some positive
   associations between worst environmental quality and neural tube,
   anencephaly, spina bifida, oral cleft, cleft palate, cleft lip with and
   without cleft palate, and gastroschisis {[}PR range: 1.12-1.55], but
   near null associations with limb reduction defects. Among domain
   specific results, we observed the strongest positive associations with
   the sociodemographic domain across birth defects but varied positive
   associations among the air and water domains, and negative or null
   associations with the land and built domains. Overall, few
   exposure-response patterns were evident. Conclusions Our results
   highlight the complexities of cumulative, simultaneous environmental
   exposures in the prevalence rates of 10 selected birth defects. We were
   able to explore the impact of overall and domain specific environmental
   quality on birth defects and identify potential domain specific drivers
   of these associations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations
   between dietary habits, emotional states, and subjective oral symptoms
   in Korean adolescents.
   Methods Data from 62,276 adolescents were derived from the 13th Korean
   Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, conducting from June 1, 2017 to
   June 30, 2017. Oral symptoms were assessed by asking students whether
   they had experienced any of following symptoms within the last 12
   months: (i) have you had a crack in your teeth or had any broken teeth
   not caused by exercise or other accidents?, (ii) have you experienced
   any toothaches while drinking or eating cold or hot beverages or foods?,
   (iii) have you ever felt throbbing in your teeth?, and (iv) have you
   experienced any gum pain or gum bleeding? A multivariable Poisson
   regression model for prevalence ratio (PR) was conducted.
   Results Of the participants, 53.1\% experienced subjective oral
   symptoms. After adjusting for confounders, participants with consumption
   of sweet drinks more than five times weekly in dietary behaviors (PR:
   1.17 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI); 1.13-1.21]), feeling stress in
   the emotional state (PR: 1.27 {[}95\% CI; 1.24-1.31]), and never
   brushing teeth (PR: 1.22 {[}95\% CI; 1.14-1.30]) in the frequency of
   toothbrushing had higher risks of having oral symptoms compared to the
   reference group.
   Conclusion Many adolescents in Korea experienced oral symptoms. The
   consumption of sweet drinks, infrequent toothbrushing, and a negative
   emotional state adversely affected perceived oral symptoms. Public
   concern about the oral health of adolescents is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Family affluence plays a crucial role in adolescent well-being and is
   potential source of health inequalities. There are scarce research
   findings in this area from a cross-national perspective. This study
   introduces several methods for measuring family affluence inequality in
   adolescent life satisfaction (LS) and assesses its relationship with
   macro-level indices. The data (N=192,718) were collected in 2013/2014 in
   39 European countries, Canada, and Israel, according to the methodology
   of the cross-national Health Behavior in School-aged Children study. The
   11-, 13- and 15-year olds were surveyed by means of self-report
   anonymous questionnaires. Fifteen methods controlling for confounders
   were tested to measure social inequality in adolescent LS. In each
   country, all measures indicated that adolescent from more affluent
   families showed higher satisfaction with their life than did those from
   less affluent families. According to the Poisson regression estimations,
   for instance, the lowest inequality in LS was found among adolescents in
   Malta, while the highest inequality in LS was found among adolescents in
   Hungary. The ratio between the mean values of LS score at the extreme
   highest and lowest family affluence levels (Relative Index of
   Inequality) derived from the regression-based models distinguished for
   its positive correlation with the Gini index, and negative correlation
   with Gross National Income, Human Development Index and the mean Overall
   Life Satisfaction score. The measure allows in-depth exploration of the
   interplay between individual and macro-socioeconomic factors affecting
   adolescent well-being from a cross-national perspective.}},

Title = {{Validation of algorithms to determine incidence of Hirschsprung disease
   in Ontario, Canada: a population-based study using health administrative
   data}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Incidence rates of Hirschsprung disease (HD) vary by
   geographical region, yet no recent population-based estimate exists for
   Canada. The objective of our study was to validate and use health
   administrative data from Ontario, Canada to describe trends in incidence
   of HD between 1991 and 2013.
   Study design: To identify children with HD we tested algorithms
   consisting of a combination of diagnostic, procedural, and intervention
   codes against the reference standard of abstracted clinical charts from
   a tertiary pediatric hospital. The algorithm with the highest positive
   predictive value (PPV) that could maintain high sensitivity was applied
   to health administrative data from April 31, 1991 to March 31, 2014
   (fiscal years 1991-2013) to determine annual incidence. Temporal trends
   were evaluated using Poisson regression, controlling for sex as a
   covariate.
   Results: The selected algorithm was highly sensitive (93.5\%) and
   specific (>99.9\%) with excellent predictive abilities (PPV 89.6\% and
   negative predictive value >99.9\%). Using the algorithm, a total of 679
   patients diagnosed with HD were identified in Ontario between 1991 and
   2013. The overall incidence during this time was 2.05 per 10,000 live
   births (or 1 in 4,868 live births). The incidence did not change
   significantly over time (odds ratio 0.998, 95\% confidence interval
   0.983-1.013, p = 0.80).
   Conclusion: Ontario health administrative data can be used to accurately
   identify cases of HD and describe trends in incidence. There has not
   been a significant change in HD incidence over time in Ontario between
   1991 and 2013.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to (1) describe the prevalence of
   mandibular incisor irregularity (11) among untreated adults in the
   United States and (2) evaluate the factors explaining individual
   differences in II. Data were derived for a random sample of 9044
   individuals (49\% male and 51\% female; 35\% Mexican American, 34\%
   black, and 31\% white) between 15 and 50 years of age collected as part
   of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Although
   the differences were small (0.5 mm), males had significantly greater 11
   than did females; blacks showed less 11 than did whites (0.9 mm) and
   Mexican Americans (1.1 mm). Family income was negatively related with
   II. Incisor irregularity increased in a curvilinear fashion with age,
   with the greatest increases occurring during early adulthood. Although
   the number of premolars and molars (first and second) were positively
   related with 11, the presence of third molars had a negative effect on
   II. Multivariate Poisson regression analyses showed that the ethnicity,
   the number of first and second molars, sex, and age combined to explain
   differences in II. Odds ratios were relatively low, indicating that
   these factors explained relatively small amounts of between-subject
   variation. We conclude that (1) approximately 50\% of individuals in the
   United States who were 15-50 years of age have little or no 11, 23\%
   have moderate 11, and 17\% have severe irregularity, (2) erupted third
   molars are not associated with increased crowding, (3) crowding
   increases most during early adulthood, and (4) although individual
   differences in crowding are multifactorial, the primary determinants
   remain unidentified.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Most antiretroviral drugs are metabolized by the liver; hepatic disease
   or liver damage as a result of hepatitis C virus (HCV) could impair this
   metabolism leading to an increased risk of drug toxicity. This study
   aimed to determine the risk of antiretroviral drug discontinuation among
   HCV/HIV coinfected patients.
   Methods:
   EuroSIDA patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy were
   included. Poisson regression identified factors associated with
   antiretroviral treatment discontinuation.
   Results:
   A total of 9535 HIV-positive patients with known HCV status were
   included (6939 HCVAb-negative; 2596 HCVAb-positive at baseline). Viremic
   HCV infection was associated with a 44\% increased risk of
   antiretroviral drug discontinuation compared with aviremic infection
   {[}adjusted incidence rate ratio, aIRR: 1.44 (95\% confidence interval,
   CI 1.22-1.69)]; this relationship was largest among nonnucleoside
   reverse transcriptase inhibitors {[}aIRR: 1.59 (95\% CI 1.18-2.14)]. In
   the subset of 935 HIV-positive patients also HCV-positive or
   HBV-positive with plasma hyaluronic acid measured, hyaluronic acid more
   than 100 ng/ml was associated with a 37\% increased risk of
   antiretroviral drug discontinuation {[}aIRR: 1.37 (95\% CI 1.08-1.73)
   vs. hyaluronic acid <= 100 ng/ml] and the effect of HCV viremia became
   nonsignificant; the largest drug association was seen for protease
   inhibitors {[}aIRR: 1.40 (95\% CI 1.04-1.89)].
   Conclusion:
   HCV viremia and high levels of hyaluronic acid predict antiretroviral
   drug discontinuation. Evidence was also found to suggest a link between
   impaired liver function and protease inhibitor toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECT The relationship between time of year and surgical site infection
   (SSI) following neurosurgical procedures is poorly understood. Authors
   of previous reports have demonstrated that rates of SSI following
   neurosurgical procedures performed during the summer months were higher
   compared with rates during other seasons. It is unclear, however, if
   this difference was related to climatological changes or inexperienced
   medical trainees (the July effect). The aim of this study was to
   evaluate for seasonal variation of SSI following spine surgery in a
   network of nonteaching community hospitals.
   METHODS The authors analyzed 6 years of prospectively collected
   surveillance data (January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2012) from all
   laminectomies and spinal fusions from 20 hospitals in the Duke Infection
   Control Outreach Network of community hospitals. Surgical site
   infections were defined using National Healthcare Safety Network
   criteria and identified using standardized methods across study
   hospitals. Regression models were then constructed using Poisson
   distribution to evaluate for seasonal trends by month. Each analysis was
   first performed for all SS's and then for SSIs caused by specific
   organisms or classes of organisms. Categorical analysis was performed
   using two separate definitions of summer: June through September
   (definition 1), and July through September (definition 2). The
   prevalence rate of SSIs during the summer was compared with the
   prevalence rate during the remainder of the year by calculating
   prevalence rate ratios and 95\% confidence intervals.
   RESULTS The authors identified 642 SSIs following 57,559 neurosurgical
   procedures (overall prevalence rate = 1.11/100 procedures); 215 occurred
   following 24,466 laminectomies (prevalence rate = 0.88/100 procedures),
   and 427 following 33093 spinal fusions (prevalence rate = 1.29/100
   procedures). Common causes of SSI were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 380;
   59\%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 90; 14\%), and Escherichia
   coli (n = 41; 6.4\%). Poisson regression models demonstrated increases
   in the rates of SSI during{''}each of the summer months for all SSIs and
   SSIs due to gram-positive cocci, S. aureus, and methicillin-sensitive S.
   aureus. Categorical analysis confirmed that the rate of SSI during the
   4-month summer period was higher than the rate during the remainder of
   the year, regardless of which definition for summer was used (definition
   1, p = 0.008; definition 2, p = 0.003). Similarly, the rates of SSI due
   to gram-positive cocci and S. aureus were higher during the summer
   months than the remainder of the year regardless of which definition of
   summer was used. However, the rate of SSI due to gram-negative bacilli
   was not.
   CONCLUSIONS The rate of SSI following fusion or spinal
   laminectomy/laminoplasty was higher during the summer in this network of
   community hospitals. The increase appears to be related to increases in
   SS's caused by gram-positive cocci and, more specifically, S. aureus.
   Given the nonteaching nature of these hospitals, the findings
   demonstrate that increases in the rate of SSI during the summer are more
   likely related to ecological and/or environmental factors than the July
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{Meta-biomaterials exhibit unprecedented or rare combinations of
   properties not usually found in nature. Such unusual mechanical, mass
   transport, and biological properties could be used to develop novel
   categories of orthopedic implants with superior performance, otherwise

   basis of snap-through instability to design deployable meta-implants.
   Deployable meta-implants are compact in their retracted state, allowing
   them to be brought to the surgical site with minimum invasiveness. Once
   in place, they are deployed to take their full-size load-bearing shape.
   We designed five types of meta-implants by arranging bi-stable elements
   in such a way to obtain a radially-deployable structure, three types of
   auxetic structures, and an axially-deployable structure. The
   intermediate stable conditions (i.e. multi-stability features),
   deployment force, and stiffness of the meta-implants were found to be
   strongly dependent on the geometrical parameters of the bi-stable
   elements as well as on their arrangement.}},

Abstract = {{Using ab initio density functional theory, the effect of hydrogen
   arrangement on the elastic properties of silicene-graphene hybrid is
   studied. Mechanical stability, elastic constants and sound velocities of
   pure and five configurations of hydrogenated SiC sheet, namely, chair,
   table, boat, zigzag and armchair, are explicitly examined. To reveal the
   anisotropic properties of the six structures, the polar plots of Young's
   modulus, Poisson ratio and acoustic waves speed are given. Compared to
   graphene, it is shown that all the isotropic systems are less stiffer
   with lower in-plane Young's modulus and stronger with their larger
   Poisson ratio, moreover, their compressional and shear waves propagate
   faster. The analysis of linear elastic behavior shows that the armchair
   configuration has an auxetic structure. The result of this work could be
   used for the design of future silicane-graphane based nanodevices with
   potentially large technological impact in nanomechanics. (C) 2015

   volume among surgical specialties in the COVID-19 pandemic}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To report changes in clinical and surgical volume impacting
   a Pediatric Otolaryngology division one year prior to and following the
   onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to five other pediatric
   surgical subspecialties. Methods: The number of clinical visits and
   surgical cases per month for six pediatric surgical specialties
   (Otolaryngology, Orthopedic Surgery, Urology, Neurosurgery, Plastic
   Surgery, and General Surgery) for 12 months prior to the pandemic and 12
   months following the onset of the pandemic was collected. Poisson
   regression analysis was performed for the number of visits and cases per
   season adjusting for specialty, season, staffing changes, and the
   pandemic to determine adjusted rate ratios (aRR) post-pandemic for the
   surgical fields compared to Otolaryngology. Results: A percentage
   decrease in median visits per paired month (-15.63\%, IQR = -23.01,
   -1.66) and operative cases (-19.86\%, IQR = -29.39, -10.17) was seen for
   Pediatric Otolaryngology. Regression analysis showed a significant
   negative effect on the number of visits (aRR = 0.74, 95\% CI =
   0.70-0.77) and cases (aRR = 0.65, 95\% CI = 0.60-0.71) due to the
   pandemic. While many of the other specialties had predicted reductions
   in volume (notably Orthopedics), they all experienced significant
   predicted increases in productivity following the pandemic compared to
   Otolaryngology. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Pediatric
   Otolaryngology is particularly vulnerable to this change in clinical
   pattern, which could be due to a decline in community infections from
   mask wearing and social distancing, and may result in a longer-term
   volume deficit when compared to other pediatric surgical subspecialties.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Prescription drug monitoring program are designed to reduce
   harms from prescription opioids; however, little is known about what
   populations benefit the most from these programs. We investigated how
   the relation between implementation of online prescription drug
   monitoring programs and rates of hospitalizations related to
   prescription opioids and heroin overdose changed over time, and varied
   across county levels of poverty and unemployment, and levels of medical
   access to opioids.
   Methods: Ecologic county-level, spatiotemporal study, including 990
   counties within 16 states, in 2001-2014. We modeled overdose counts
   using Bayesian hierarchical Poisson models. We defined medical access to
   opioids as the county-level rate of hospital discharges for noncancer
   pain conditions.
   Results: In 2010-2014, online prescription drug monitoring programs were
   associated with lower rates of prescription opioid-related
   hospitalizations (rate ratio 2014 = 0.74; 95\% credible interval = 0.69,
   0.80). The association between online prescription drug monitoring
   programs and heroin-related hospitalization was also negative but tended
   to increase in later years. Counties with lower rates of noncancer pain
   conditions experienced a lower decrease in prescription opioid overdose
   and a faster increase in heroin overdoses. No differences were observed
   across different county levels of poverty and unemployment.
   Conclusions: Areas with lower levels of noncancer pain conditions
   experienced the smallest decrease in prescription opioid overdose and
   the faster increase in heroin overdose following implementation of
   online prescription drug monitoring programs. Our results are consistent
   with the hypothesis that prescription drug monitoring programs are most
   effective in areas where people are likely to access opioids through
   medical providers.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Studies of prenatal per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
   (PFAS) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-related
   behaviors in children are inconsistent.
   Objectives: To examine associations between maternal serum PFAS
   concentrations and child behavior in 241 mother-child dyads within the
   Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study.
   Methods: We quantified perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane
   sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and
   perfluorononanoate (PFNA) in maternal serum collected during pregnancy
   or at delivery. We evaluated a total of 17 outcomes of child behavior
   using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2 (BASC-2) at 5 and
   8 years (n = 240) and ADHD diagnostic symptoms and criteria with the
   Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Young Child (DISC-YC) at 5
   years (n = 190). We used linear mixed models and logistic regression
   with generalized estimating equations to assess associations between
   PFAS and continuous or dichotomous ``at risk{''} BASC-2 scores; negative
   binomial regression to calculate incident rate ratios for counts of ADHD
   symptoms; and Poisson regression with robust standard errors to
   calculate relative risks of meeting ADHD diagnostic criteria.
   Results: Each ln-unit increase in PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA was associated
   with higher BASC-2 scores and increased odds of ``at-risk{''} scores for
   externalizing behaviors, including hyperactivity (PFOS: odds ratio
   {[}OR] 2.7, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.2, 5.9; PFHxS: OR 2.5,
   95\% CI 1.5, 4.3; PFNA: OR 3.2, 95\% CI 1.3, 8.0). PFHxS was also
   associated with internalizing problems (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.1, 3.4) and
   somatization (OR 2.2, 95\% CI 1.2, 4.0). PFOS and PFNA were
   significantly associated with 50-80\% more DISC-YC symptoms and
   diagnostic criteria related to hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD. Prenatal
   PFNA was associated with increased risk of any-type ADHD.
   Conclusions: Prenatal PFOS and PFNA were consistently associated with
   measures related to hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD across two validated
   assessment instruments. PFHxS was associated with increased problems
   with both externalizing and internalizing behaviors. No associations
   were noted between PFOA and child neurobehavior.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Electronic skins (e-skins)-electronic sensors mechanically compliant to
   human skin-have long been developed as an ideal electronic platform for
   noninvasive human health monitoring. For reliable physical health
   monitoring, the interface between the e-skin and human skin must be
   conformal and intact consistently. However, conventional e-skins cannot
   perfectly permeate sweat in normal day-to-day activities, resulting in
   degradation of the intimate interface over time and impeding stable
   physical sensing. Here, we present a sweat pore-inspired perforated
   e-skin that can effectively suppress sweat accumulation and allow
   inorganic sensors to obtain physical health information without
   malfunctioning. The auxetic dumbbell through-hole patterns in perforated
   e-skins lead to synergistic effects on physical properties including
   mechanical reliability, conformability, areal mass density, and adhesion
   to the skin. The perforated e-skin allows one to laminate onto the skin
   with consistent homeostasis, enabling multiple inorganic sensors on the
   skin to reliably monitor the wearer's health over a period of weeks.}},

Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{274-283}},

Abstract = {{Branched shish-kebabs (bimodal orientation of lamellae) were
   successfully fabricated in oriented isotactic polypropylene (iPP) by a
   strong shear flow provided by a modified injection molding (OSIM)
   technique. Simultaneous with the uniaxial tensile, the deformation
   behavior of this unique branched shish-kebabs was probed by in situ
   synchrotron X-ray scattering. Compared with the isotropic counterpart,
   branched shish-kebabs exhibited enhanced strength and modulus without
   obvious necking. During deformation, the initial separation of kebabs
   drove the rotation of branched lamellae towards the tensile direction
   with constant distance herein, which turned out to be an auxetic
   behavior. Subsequently, partial destruction of branched lamellae and
   significant lamellae slip of kebabs occurred, followed by reordering of
   kebabs and the residual branched lamellae accompanying the formation of
   new crystals with their c-axis along the tensile direction. On the
   whole, this work testified the validation of `stress-induced crystal
   fragmentation and recrystallization process' principle in the
   deformation of oriented samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We study the deformation of a chiral cylinder subjected to a prescribed
   thermal field in the context of the linear theory of gradient
   thermoelasticity. First, we investigate the effects of a thermal field
   which is independent of the axial coordinate. It is shown that the
   temperature variation produces extension, bending, torsion and a plane
   deformation. Then, we study the deformation of the rod when the thermal
   field is a polynomial of degree m in the axial coordinate. The solution
   is reduced to the solving of some two-dimensional problems. The method
   is used to solve the problem of a circular cylinder subjected to a
   uniform temperature field. In contrast with the case of achiral
   materials, a constant thermal field in an isotropic chiral cylinder
   produces torsional effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{To determine if HIV primary care engagement (PCE) is associated with
   Emergency Department (ED) utilization, a retrospective cohort study
   using the South Carolina HIV surveillance data from January 1986 to
   December 2006 linked to the hospital discharge data-set was used to
   assess utilization at statewide EDs during January 2007-December 2010.
   Suboptimal PCE was defined as <2 reports of a CD4 + T-cell count or
   viral load value to surveillance in each calendar year from January 2007
   to December 2010. Multivariable logistic regression explored
   associations of HIV PCE with ED utilization after accounting for
   sociodemographic characteristics and disease stage. Poisson and negative
   binominal regression examined PCE, sociodemographic characteristics, and
   disease stage on the frequency of ED utilization. Suboptimal PCE was
   associated with increased odds of ED utilization for NIR/NRR (no
   identified risk/no risk reported; aOR {[}adjusted odds ratio] = 2.25; CI
   = 1.69-2.99), self-payers (aOR = 1.81; CI = 1.38-2.39), and those
   diagnosed with an AIDS-defining illness (ADI; aOR = 1.51; CI =
   1.14-2.00), who also had the most median ED visits (six). More ED visits
   were associated with young age, female (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] =

   (IRR = 1.86; CI = 1.57-2.21), or AIDS > 1 year (IRR = 1.23; CI =
   1.13-1.35). Fewer visits to the ED were associated with MSM (males
   having sex with males IRR = 0.81; CI = 0.72-0.90), NIR/NRR (IRR = 0.86;
   CI = 0.78-0.95), self-payers (IRR = 0.56; CI = 0.50-0.62), or Medicare
   recipients (IRR = 0.85; CI = 0.77-0.95). Disease stage and insurance
   type were differentially associated with primary care and ED
   utilization. There is a need to evaluate HIV primary care systems to
   increase access and develop interventions to reduce preventable ED

Title = {{Community income and surgical rates in the Netherlands}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{519-522}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: The study describes variations in use of surgical procedures
   by community income in the Netherlands. From the literature it is known
   that surgical rates have a socioeconomic gradient. Both positive and
   negative associations of socioeconomic factors of patients ( for
   example, income, education) with surgical rates have been reported. The
   question raised here is: how do ( possible) socioeconomic variations in
   surgery in the Netherlands compare with variations observed elsewhere?
   Data and Methods: The data comprised Dutch hospital discharges and
   population estimates for 1999. Socioeconomic status was indicated by a
   patient's income and based on the average family income of the postcode
   area of residence. Poisson regression was used to compute relative
   incidence ( odds ratios) for 10 common surgical procedures. The model
   included age, gender, degree of urbanisation, and province of residence.
   Results: The association between surgical rates and community level
   income is rather weak. For half of the surgical rates the authors
   observed higher utilisation rates in communities with low income levels,
   but the differences are small. The range of odds ratios in the lowest
   income quintile group ( compared with the group with the highest income)
   observed is: 0.87 to 1.18. Men from a low income community received more
   appendicectomies ( 1.18), cholecystectomies ( 1.12), knee replacements (
   1.06), and prostatectomies ( 1.14) and less tonsillectomies ( 0.90).
   Women from a low income community received more appendicectomies (
   1.12), caesarean sections ( 1.18), hip and knee replacements (
   1.05,1.17), and hysterectomies ( 1.14). Whereas they received less
   coronary artery bypass grafts ( 0.92), cholecystectomies ( 0.87), and
   tonsillectomies ( 0.92).
   Conclusions: Compared with findings reported in the international
   literature, this study indicates that variations in use of surgical
   procedures by community income in the Netherlands are comparatively
   small. Because of lack of data the authors could not study the influence
   of variations in need for surgical care by community income, but as the
   incidence of conditions requiring surgical interventions generally is
   higher in lower income groups, it is suspected some degree of
   underutilisation exists in these groups.}},

Abstract = {{Various structural configurations of iron trifluoride appear at the
   nanoscale and macroscopic size, either in the amorphous or crystalline
   state. The specific atomic organization in these structures crucially
   alters the performance of FeF3 as an effective cathode in Li-ion
   batteries. Our detailed first-principles computational simulations
   examine the structural strains induced by temperature and stress on the
   four anhydrous polymorphs observed so far in FeF3 at ambient pressure. A
   wealth of data covering previous experimental results on their
   equilibrium structures and extending their characterization with new
   static and isothermal equations of state is provided. We inform on how
   porous apertures associated with the six-octahedra rings of the HTB and
   pyrochlore phases are modified under compressive and expansive strains.
   A quasi-auxetic behavior at low pressures for the ground state
   rhombohedral phase is detected, which is in concordance with its
   anomalous structural anisotropy. In contrast with the effect of
   temperature, this structure undergoes under negative pressure phase
   transitions to the other three polymorphs, indicating potential
   conditions where low-density FeF3 could show a better performance in
   technological applications.}},

Abstract = {{Crashworthiness design and development of lightweight structures have
   become important engineering challenges because of the high standards of
   energy consumption and safety regulations. Within this context, the use
   of honeycomb structures as crush absorber is continuously growing in
   automotive and aircraft industries, once honeycombs are known for their
   high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent energy absorbing capacity.
   Thus, this paper presents a method that combines radial basis functions
   with expected improvement to optimize the specific energy absorption of
   honeycomb cellular materials, while the peak crush force is constrained
   at low levels for safety reasons. Honeycomb's cell size, cell shape and
   thickness are the design variables. Concerning the cell shape, the
   results indicate the hexagonal configuration has a higher out-of-plane
   performance compared to auxetic and rectangular cells in terms of energy
   absorption capacity. Lastly, a multi-objective optimization using only
   the radial basis function predictor (without sequential sampling) is
   carried out to seek simultaneously for optimal solutions with minimum
   peak force and maximum specific energy absorption.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To assess the impact of ambient temperature on faecal
   immunochemical test (FIT) performance in the colorectal cancer screening
   programme of Emilia-Romagna (Italy).
   Methods A population-based retrospective cohort study on data from 2005
   to 2011. Positive rate, detection rate, and positive predictive value
   rate for cancers and adenomas, and incidence rate of interval cancers
   after negative tests were analysed using Poisson regression models. In
   addition to ambient temperature, gender, age, screening history, and
   Local Health Unit were also considered.
   Results In 1,521,819 tests analysed, the probability of a positive
   result decreased linearly with increasing temperature. Point estimates
   and 95\% Confidence Intervals were estimated for six temperature classes
   (<5, 5 |-10, 10 |-15, 15 |-20, 20|-25 and 25?), and referred to the
   5|-10? class. The positive rate ratio was significantly related to
   temperature increase: 0.99 (0.97-1.02), 1, 0.98 (0.96-1.00), 0.96
   (0.94-0.99), 0.93 (0.91-0.96), 0.92 (0.89-0.95). A linear trend was also
   evident for advanced adenoma detection rate ratio: 1.00 (0.96-1.04), 1,
   0.98 (0.93-1.02), 0.96 (0.92-1.00), 0.92 (0.88-0.96), 0.94 (0.88-1.01).
   The effect was less linear, but still important, for cancer detection
   rates: 0.95 (0.85-1.06), 1, 1.00 (0.90-1.10), 0.94 (0.85-1.05), 0.81
   (0.72-0.92), 0.93 (0.80-1.09). No association or linear trend was found
   for positive predictive values or risk of interval cancer, despite an
   excess of +16\% in the highest temperature class for interval cancer.
   Conclusions Ambient temperatures can affect screening performance.
   Continued monitoring is needed to verify the effect of introducing FIT
   tubes with a new buffer, which should guarantee a higher stability of
   haemoglobin.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Globally, Indigenous populations have higher rates of
   suicidal behavior and psychological distress compared to non-Indigenous
   populations. Indigenous populations also report high rates of exposure
   to discrimination, which could potentially contribute to poor mental
   health outcomes. The objectives of this paper were to estimate the
   prevalence of discrimination among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
   males in Australia and to examine the role of discrimination in the
   association between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status and
   suicidal thoughts and depressive symptoms. Methods: We used
   cross-sectional data on 13,697 males aged 18-55 years from the
   Australian Longitudinal Study on Male Health. We undertook a Poisson
   regression with robust standard error analyses to examine Aboriginal and
   Torres Strait Islander status and self-perceived exposure to
   discrimination in the past 2 years as correlates of recent suicidal
   ideation. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to assess
   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status and self-perceived exposure
   to discrimination as correlates of recent depressive symptoms. Results:
   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males have a twofold higher
   prevalence of self-perceived discrimination (39.2\% vs 19.3\%, p <
   0.001), suicidal ideation (21.8\% vs 9.4\%, p < 0.001) and moderate or
   worse depressive symptoms (24.0\% vs 12.2\%, p < 0.001) as compared to
   their non-Indigenous counterparts. After adjusting for sociodemographics
   and substance use, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status was
   significantly associated with suicidal thoughts (odds ratio = 1.49, p =
   0.019) and depressive symptoms (prevalence rate ratio = 1.19, p =
   0.018). About 15.3\% and 28.7\% of the association between Aboriginal
   and Torres Strait Islander status and suicidal thoughts and depressive
   symptoms, respectively, was explained by discrimination. Conclusion: Our
   analyses add to evidence that discrimination is a contributor to mental
   health disparities between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and
   non-Indigenous populations in Australia. Reducing discrimination ought
   to be considered as part of strategies to improve the social and
   emotional well-being of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.}},

Title = {{Assessing the Paradox Between Transmitted and Acquired HIV Type 1 Drug
   Resistance Mutations in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study From 1998 to 2012}},

Abstract = {{Background. Transmitted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) drug
   resistance (TDR) mutations are transmitted from nonresponding patients
   (defined as patients with no initial response to treatment and those
   with an initial response for whom treatment later failed) or from
   patients who are naive to treatment. Although the prevalence of drug
   resistance in patients who are not responding to treatment has declined
   in developed countries, the prevalence of TDR mutations has not.
   Mechanisms causing this paradox are poorly explored.
   Methods. We included recently infected, treatment-naive patients with
   genotypic resistance tests performed <= 1 year after infection and
   before 2013. Potential risk factors for TDR mutations were analyzed
   using logistic regression. The association between the prevalence of TDR
   mutations and population viral load (PVL) among treated patients during
   1997-2011 was estimated with Poisson regression for all TDR mutations
   and individually for the most frequent resistance mutations against each
   drug class (ie, M184V/L90M/K103N).
   Results. We included 2421 recently infected, treatment-naive patients
   and 5399 patients with no response to treatment. The prevalence of TDR
   mutations fluctuated considerably over time. Two opposing developments
   could explain these fluctuations: generally continuous increases in the
   prevalence of TDR mutations (odds ratio, 1.13; P =.010), punctuated by
   sharp decreases in the prevalence when new drug classes were introduced.
   Overall, the prevalence of TDR mutations increased with decreasing PVL
   (rate ratio {[}RR], 0.91 per 1000 decrease in PVL; P =.033).
   Additionally, we observed that the transmitted high-fitness-cost
   mutation M184V was positively associated with the PVL of nonresponding
   patients carrying M184V (RR, 1.50 per 100 increase in PVL; P <.001).
   Such association was absent for K103N (RR, 1.00 per 100 increase in PVL;
   P =.99) and negative for L90M(RR, 0.75 per 100 increase in PVL; P
   =.022).
   Conclusions. Transmission of antiretroviral drug resistance is
   temporarily reduced by the introduction of new drug classes and driven
   by nonresponding and treatment-naive patients. These findings suggest a
   continuous need for new drugs, early detection/treatment of HIV-1
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The aim of the study was to investigate whether lamivudine
   (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) use following detection of M184V/I is
   associated with better virological outcomes.
   Methods We identified people with viruses harbouring the M184V/I
   mutation in UK multicentre data sets who had treatment change/initiation
   within 1 year. We analysed outcomes of viral suppression (< 200 HIV-1
   RNA copies/mL) and appearance of new major drug resistance mutations
   (DRMs) using Cox and Poisson models, with stratification by new drug
   regimen (excluding 3TC/FTC) and Bayesian implementation, and estimated
   the effect of 3TC/FTC adjusted for individual and viral characteristics.
   Results We included 2597 people with the M184V/I resistance mutation, of
   whom 665 (25.6\%) were on 3TC and 458 (17.6\%) on FTC. We found a
   negative adjusted association between 3TC/FTC use and viral suppression
   {[}hazard ratio (HR) 0.84; 95\% credibility interval (CrI) 0.71-0.98].
   On subgroup analysis of individual drugs, there was no evidence of an
   association with viral suppression for 3TC (n = 184; HR 0.94; 95\% CrI
   0.73-1.15) or FTC (n = 454; HR 0.99; 95\% CrI 0.80-1.19) amongst those
   on tenofovir-containing regimens, but we estimated a reduced rate of
   viral suppression for people on 3TC amongst those without tenofovir use
   (n = 481; HR 0.71; 95\% CrI 0.54-0.90). We found no association between
   3TC/FTC and detection of any new DRM (overall HR 0.92; 95\% CrI
   0.64-1.18), but found inconclusive evidence of a lower incidence rate of
   new DRMs (overall incidence rate ratio 0.69; 95\% CrI 0.34-1.11).
   Conclusions We did not find evidence that 3TC or FTC use is associated
   with an increase in viral suppression, but it may reduce the appearance
   of additional DRMs in people with M184V/I. 3TC was associated with
   reduced viral suppression amongst people on regimens without tenofovir.}},

Abstract = {{Background Older adults with concurrent low back and hip pain are
   predisposed to reductions in physical performance and health-related
   quality of life. Yet no study to date has assessed whether or not
   coexisting hip impairments increase fall risk in older adults with
   chronic low back pain (CLBP). The objective of this study was to
   determine if hip osteoarthritis (OA) signs and symptoms per American
   College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria are associated with fall risk
   over a 1-year span. Methods Falls were prospectively monitored for 1
   year via fall calendars. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), anxiolytic
   use, balance confidence, LBP-related disability, and prior fall history
   were identified as covariates. Hip pain, pain with hip internal rotation
   (IR), hip IR range of motion (ROM) >= 15 degrees, and morning stiffness
   lasting <= 60 min were evaluated at baseline and summed to represent hip
   OA impairment burden. A generalized linear model with a Poisson
   distribution and log link function assessed the association between ACR
   criteria and fall risk beyond established covariates. As a secondary
   analysis, binary logistic regression assessed ACR criteria and the odds
   of falling two or more times within a year. Results Data from
   two-hundred and ten participants were analyzed. Hip OA signs and
   symptoms were present in 97.1\% of the participants, and hip OA
   impairment burden was significantly greater (p < 0.050) in participants
   who fell >= 2 times compared to single and non-fallers. Higher hip OA
   impairment burden was associated with significantly increased fall risk
   (p = 0.001, risk ratio = 1.23, 95\% CI 1.09-1.38) and odds of falling
   multiple times (p < 0.05, odds ratio = 1.41, 95\% CI 1.01-1.95) after
   adjustment for covariates. Conclusions Older adults with CLBP and
   concomitant hip impairments are an at-risk group for falling. Healthcare
   professionals should employ falls screening and preventive measures to
   avoid negative sequelae in this vulnerable population.}},

Abstract = {{The high-order fluid model developed in part I of this series is
   employed here to study the propagation of negative planar streamer
   fronts in pure nitrogen. The model consists of the balance equations for
   electron density, average electron velocity, average electron energy and
   average electron energy flux. These balance equations have been obtained
   as velocity moments of Boltzmann's equation and are here coupled to the
   Poisson equation for the space charge electric field. Here the results
   of simulations with the high-order model, with a particle-in-cell/Monte
   Carlo (PIC/MC) model and with the first-order fluid model based on the
   hydrodynamic drift-diffusion approximation are presented and compared.
   The comparison with the MC model clearly validates our high-order fluid
   model, thus supporting its correct theoretical derivation and numerical
   implementation. The results of the first-order fluid model with local
   field approximation, as usually used for streamer discharges, show
   considerable deviations. Furthermore, we study the inaccuracies of
   simulation results caused by an inconsistent implementation of transport
   data into our high-order fluid model. We also demonstrate the importance
   of the energy flux term in the high-order model by comparing with
   results where this term is neglected. Finally, results with an
   approximation for the high-order tensor in the energy flux equation is
   found to agree well with the PIC/MC results for reduced electric fields
   up to 1000 Townsend, as considered in this work.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) crystalline structures based on a honeycomb
   geometry are analyzed by computer simulations using the Monte Carlo
   method in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble. The considered crystals are
   formed by hard discs (HD) of two different diameters which are very
   close to each other. In contrast to equidiameter HD, which crystallize
   into a homogeneous solid which is elastically isotropic due to its
   six-fold symmetry axis, the systems studied in this work contain
   artificial patterns and can be either isotropic or anisotropic. It turns
   out that the symmetry of the patterns obtained by the appropriate
   arrangement of two types of discs strongly influences their elastic
   properties. The Poisson's ratio (PR) of each of the considered
   structures was studied in two aspects: (a) its dependence on the
   external isotropic pressure and (b) in the function of the direction
   angle, in which the deformation of the system takes place, since some of
   the structures are anisotropic. In order to accomplish the latter, the
   general analytic formula for the orientational dependence of PR in 2D
   systems was used. The PR analysis at extremely high pressures has shown
   that for the vast majority of the considered structures it is
   approximately direction independent (isotropic) and tends to the upper
   limit for isotropic 2D systems, which is equal to +1. This is in
   contrast to systems of equidiameter discs for which it tends to 0.13,
   i.e., a value almost eight times smaller.}},

Abstract = {{Propagation of infinitely-lived true surface waves (TSW) and of the
   evanescent surface resonances (pseudo surface waves, PSW) on the inner
   surface of a cylindrical cavity in an elastic medium coated with a thin
   elastic membrane is studied. An analogous flat surface with the same
   coating is considered as a reference system. The dispersion relations of
   the true surface waves and of the surface resonances are shown to depend
   on the interplay between the sound speeds in the substrate and in the
   covering layer. The short-wavelength limit of the excitations in the
   cavity is checked to be consistent with the case of the flat surface.
   Analytical expressions are obtained for the cut-offs and for the
   asymptotic behaviors of the excitations in the long-wavelength and short
   wavelength limits. The local surface densities of states (LDOS) as well
   as the real parts of the Green's functions, i.e., analogues of the
   reactive power, are calculated. The most eminent anomalies of LDOS,
   which correspond to the longitudinal resonance, are shown to be located
   close to the apparently spurious roots of the secular determinant of the
   surface equations of motion. The roots correspond generally to the total
   conversion of the longitudinal to transverse bulk waves. These roots
   show cut-offs, where the life time of the longitudinal resonance
   increases to infinity. For still lower wave vectors the maxima of LDOS
   follow the lines of total conversion transverse-to-longitudinal with
   finite life-times. The radius dependence of the cut-off wave vector in
   the small-radius limit for a fully symmetric torsional mode is 1/root a
   and for a fully symmetric high-frequency axial-radial TSW follows a 1/a
   behavior, whereas the analogous dependence for a quasi-Rayleigh surface
   wave is proportional to 1/root alna except for a certain range of
   parameters, where the high-frequency TSW does not exist. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{There exist several honeycomb networks exhibiting zero Poisson's ratio
   (ZPR). Applications of these networks can be found in different fields.
   The ZPR properties of these structures have been mechanically modeled
   and tested. However, the underlying mechanism driving the ZPR behavior
   has not been paid much attention. The present work focuses on the
   deformation mechanism of the ZPR networks. Through the discussion and
   comparison of the deformation process of the ZPR, auxetic and common
   honeycomb networks, the strain-isolation mechanism is proposed to
   explain the ZPR behavior. Then, according to this mechanism, the
   reversed semi-re-entrant (RSRE) honeycomb is created. With experimental
   measurements and finite-element analysis (FEA), the ZPR properties of
   the RSRE can be proven. The strain-isolation mechanism can not only
   explain the ZPR behavior but also be used in the design of new ZPR
   honeycomb networks. 3D ZPR structures are also derived from the 2D
   honeycomb networks. Their Poisson's ratios in 3D space are also
   discussed based on FEA results. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Title = {{3D Printing metamaterials towards tissue engineering}},
Journal = {{APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The rapid growth and disruptive potentials of three-dimensional (3D)
   printing demand further research for addressing fundamental fabrication
   concepts and enabling engineers to realize the capabilities of 3D
   printing technologies. There is a trend to use these capabilities to
   develop materials that derive some of their properties via their
   structural organization rather than their intrinsic constituents,
   sometimes referred to as mechanical metamaterials. Such materials show
   qualitatively different mechanical behaviors despite using the same
   material composition, such as ultra-lightweight, super-elastic, and
   auxetic structures. In this work, we review current advancements in the
   design and fabrication of multi-scale advanced structures with
   properties heretofore unseen in well-established materials. We classify
   the fabrication methods as conventional methods, additive manufacturing
   techniques, and 4D printing. Following a comprehensive comparison of
   different fabrication methods, we suggest some guidelines on the
   selection of fabrication parameters to construct meta-biomaterials for
   tissue engineering. The parameters include multi-material capacity,
   fabrication resolution, prototyping speed, and biological compatibility.

Abstract = {{The lithospheric stress field is formally divided into three components:
   a standard pressure which is a function of elevation (only), a
   topographic stress anomaly (3-D tensor field) and a tectonic stress
   anomaly (3-D tensor field). The boundary between topographic and
   tectonic stress anomalies is somewhat arbitrary, and here is based on
   the modeling tools available. The topographic stress anomaly is computed
   by numerical convolution of density anomalies with three tensor Green's
   functions provided by Boussinesq, Cerruti and Mindlin. By assuming
   either a seismically estimated or isostatic Moho depth, and by using
   Poisson ratio of either 0.25 or 0.5, I obtain four alternative
   topographic stress models. The tectonic stress field, which satisfies
   the homogeneous quasi-static momentum equation, is obtained from
   particular second derivatives of Maxwell vector potential fields which
   are weighted sums of basis functions representing constant tectonic
   stress components, linearly varying tectonic stress components and
   tectonic stress components that vary harmonically in one, two and three
   dimensions. Boundary conditions include zero traction due to tectonic
   stress anomaly at sea level, and zero traction due to the total stress
   anomaly on model boundaries at depths within the asthenosphere. The
   total stress anomaly is fit by least squares to both World Stress Map
   data and to a previous faulted-lithosphere, realistic-rheology dynamic
   model of the region computed with finite-element program Shells. No
   conflict is seen between the two target data sets, and the best-fitting
   model (using an isostatic Moho and Poisson ratio 0.5) gives minimum
   directional misfits relative to both targets. Constraints of computer
   memory, execution time and ill-conditioning of the linear system (which
   requires damping) limit harmonically varying tectonic stress to no more
   than six cycles along each axis of the model. The primary limitation on
   close fitting is that the Shells model predicts very sharp shallow
   stress maxima and discontinuous horizontal compression at the Moho,
   which the new model can only approximate. The new model also lacks the
   spatial resolution to portray the localized stress states that may occur
   near the central surfaces of weak faults; instead, the model portrays
   the regional or background stress field which provides boundary
   conditions for weak faults. Peak shear stresses in one registered model
   and one alternate model are 120 and 150 MPa, respectively, while peak
   vertically integrated shear stresses are 2.9 x 10(12) and 4.1 x 10(12) N
   m(-1). Channeling of deviatoric stress along the strong Great Valley and
   the western slope of the Peninsular Ranges is evident. In the
   neotectonics of southern California, it appears that deviatoric stress
   and long-term strain rate have a negative correlation, because regions
   of low heat flow are strong and act as stress guides, while undergoing
   very little internal deformation. In contrast, active faults lie
   preferentially in areas with higher heat flow, and their low strength
   keeps deviatoric stresses locally modest.}},

Abstract = {{Topology optimization is a technique in the engineering area that allows
   obtaining optimal designs of devices, mechanisms, complex structures and
   even design the microstructure of an auxetic material. Classically, the
   focus was made on considering the problem of obtaining such designs
   comprised of only one material. More recently, some efforts have been
   made to incorporate more than one material to the optimization problem.
   The present work addresses the topology optimization problem considering
   multiple materials on a fixed project domain. For the geometric
   description of the material domains, the concept of multiple level-sets
   has been used, meanwhile, its nucleation and evolution are governed by
   functions constructed from the topological derivative of a functional to
   be minimized The topological optimization algorithm developed to solve
   the multi-material topological optimization problem is described and its
   optimality condition is well established. Numerical examples applied to
   planar elasticity, bending plate, bi-dimensional steady-state heat
   transfer and optimal design of piezoelectric actuator problems are
   presented. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Pattern Switching in Soft Cellular Structures and Hydrogel-Elastomer
   Composite Materials under Compression}},
Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that elastic instabilities induce pattern
   transformations when a soft cellular structure is compressed beyond
   critical limits. The nonlinear phenomena of pattern transformations make
   them a prime candidate for controlling macroscopic or microscopic
   deformation and auxetic properties of the material. In this present
   work, the novel mechanical properties of soft cellular structures and
   related hydrogel-elastomer composites are examined through experimental
   investigation and numerical simulations. We provide two reliable
   approaches for fabricating hydrogel-elastomer composites with rationally
   designed properties and transformed patterns, and demonstrate that
   different geometries of the repeat unit voids of the periodic pattern
   can be used to influence the global characteristics of the soft
   composite material. The experimental and numerical results indicate that
   the transformation event is dependent on the boundary conditions and
   material properties of matrix material for soft cellular structures;
   meanwhile, the deformation-triggered pattern of matrix material affects
   the pattern switching and mechanical properties of the
   hydrogel-elastomer material, thus providing future perspectives for
   optimal design, or serving as a fabrication suggestion of the new
   hydrogel-elastomer composite material.}},

Title = {{Wave sensitivity analysis for periodic and arbitrarily complex composite
   structures}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1572-1597}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to present the development of a numerical
   continuum-discrete approach for computing the sensitivity of the waves
   propagating in periodic composite structures. The work can be directly
   used for evaluating the sensitivity of the structural dynamic
   performance with respect to geometric and layering structural
   modifications.
   Design/methodology/approach - A structure of arbitrary layering and
   geometric complexity is modelled using solid finite element (FE). A
   generic expression for computing the variation of the mass and the
   stiffness matrices of the structure with respect to the material and
   geometric characteristics is hereby given. The sensitivity of the
   structural wave properties can thus be numerically determined by
   computing the variability of the corresponding eigenvalues for the
   resulting eigenproblem. The exhibited approach is validated against the
   finite difference method as well as analytical results.
   Findings - An intense wavenumber dependence is observed for the
   sensitivity results of a sandwich structure. This exhibits the
   importance and potential of the presented tool with regard to the
   optimization of layered structures for specific applications. The model
   can also be used for computing the effect of the inclusion of smart
   layers such as auxetics and piezoelectrics.
   Originality/value - The paper presents the first continuum-discrete
   approach specifically developed for accurately and efficiently computing
   the sensitivity of the wave propagation data for periodic composite
   structures irrespective of their size. The considered structure can be
   of arbitrary layering and material characteristics as FEmodelling is
   used.}},

Journal = {{APL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are a sub-category of designer materials where
   the geometry of the material at the small-scale is rationally designed
   to give rise to unusual properties and functionalities. Here, we propose
   the concept of ``action-at-a-distance{''} metamaterials where a specific
   pattern of local deformation is programmed into the fabric of (cellular)
   materials. The desired pattern of local actuation could then be achieved
   simply through the application of one single global and far-field force.
   We proposed graded designs of auxetic and conventional unit cells with
   changing Poisson's ratios as a way of making ``action-at-a-distance{''}
   metamaterials. We explored five types of graded designs including
   linear, two types of radial gradients, checkered, and striped. Specimens
   were fabricated with indirect additive manufacturing and tested under
   compression, tension, and shear. Full-field strain maps measured with
   digital image correlation confirmed different patterns of local
   actuation under similar far-field strains. These materials have
   potential applications in soft (wearable) robotics and exosuits. (c)

Abstract = {{The paper presents an investigation and analysis of the
   electromechanical and thermal characteristics of the carbon fiber alone
   as single tow and embedded in host materials such as polymer e.g.,
   acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) using 3D printing. While carbon
   fibers can partially reinforce the structure, they can act as sensors to
   monitor the structural health of the host material. The piezo-resistive
   behavior was examined without any pretreatment of the carbon fiber under
   tensile test in both cases. Special focus on the filaments clamping
   types and their effects was observed. An auxetic behavior was exhibited;
   otherwise, the free part shows elastic and yielding ranges with break
   point at high resistance. An induced temperature of the carbon fiber was
   measured during the tensile test to show low variation. The carbon fiber
   can provide strength contribution to the host material depending on the
   percentage of filling the material in 3D printing. The relative
   variation of the electrical resistance increases by 400\% while embedded
   in the host material, but decreases as the tows filament density
   increases from 1 to 12 K.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{90}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{It is shown that some of the orthotropic models reported in the
   literature for the mechanical response of elastic arteries and which
   assume a separable dependence on the I4, I4, I6 invariants predict
   curious and unexpected behaviour in simple tension. Specifically it is
   shown that the out-of-plane stress response can be stiffer than the
   in-plane over a moderate range of strain and that when the in-plane
   response is much stiffer than the out-of plane, as might be expected for
   a fibre-reinforced material, it is accompanied by a large auxetic
   response in the out-of-plane direction. This mechanical response for
   this class of orthotropic materials seems counterintuitive and it is
   hypothesised that it could be due to their well-known inability to fully
   recover the linear theory, on restriction to infinitesimal deformations.
   A generalisation of these models that is fully compatible with the
   linear theory is proposed. An alternative strategy of assuming that the
   fibres cannot support compression is shown not to be a universal remedy.}},

Abstract = {{Alloys of iron and non-magnetic gallium (of the form Fe1-xGax where x
   ranges from 13 to 30) exhibit large magnetostrictions of over 300 ppm at
   room temperature that are produced by saturation magnetic fields of
   approximately 600 Oe. While not producing magnetostrictions of the
   degree achievable with giant magnetostrictives, large magnetostrictive
   alloys of iron and gallium - called Galfenol - have much more desirable
   mechanical characteristics, such as non-brittleness and in-plane auxetic
   behavior. Additionally, Galfenol requires a much smaller saturation
   magnetic field than the giant magnetostrictives Terfenol and Terfenol-D
   (alloys of Iron and non-metallic Terbium and Dysprosium). Beginning from
   the body of knowledge gained from Terfenol and Terfenol-D dynamic
   research transducer designs is a good starting point for designing a
   Galfenol dynamic research transducer. However, several modifications are
   being made to adapt the transducer to some of Galfenol's unique
   properties. Any measured value uncertainty will quickly propagate
   through the calculated material properties. While not completely
   successful at addressing all the unique aspects Galfenol in this
   transducer design, the data presented will assist in future design
   attempts.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction It is important to monitor the safety profile of drugs, and
   mining for strong associations between drugs and adverse events is an
   effective and inexpensive method of post-marketing safety surveillance.
   Objective The objective of our work was to compare the accuracy of both
   common and innovative methods of data mining for pharmacovigilance
   purposes.
   Methods We used the reference standard provided by the Observational
   Medical Outcomes Partnership, which contains 398 drug-adverse event
   pairs (165 positive controls, 233 negative controls). Ten methods and
   algorithms were applied to the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System
   data to investigate the 398 pairs. The ten methods include popular
   methods in the pharmacovigilance literature, newly developed
   pharmacovigilance methods as at 2018, and popular methods in the
   genome-wide association study literature. We compared their performance
   using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot, area under the
   curve (AUC), and Youden's index.
   Results The Bayesian confidence propagation neural network had the
   highest AUC overall. Monte Carlo expectation maximization, a method
   developed in 2018, had the second highest AUC and the highest Youden's
   index, and performed very well in terms of high specificity. The
   regression-adjusted gamma Poisson shrinkage model performed best under
   high-sensitivity requirements.
   Conclusion Our results will be useful to help choose a method for a
   given desired level of specificity. Methods popular in the genome-wide
   association study literature did not perform well because of the
   sparsity of data and will need modification before their properties can
   be used in the drug-adverse event association problem.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims: Lifestyle variables have a key role in the

   Methods and results: This study carried out a school-based survey in the
   Brazilian city of Maringa in Parana. The representative sample was of
   991 adolescents (54.5\% girls) from both public and private high schools
   selected through multi-stage random sampling. AO was classified
   according to waist circumference value. The independent variables
   studied were: gender, age, socioeconomic level, parental and household
   characteristics, smoking, alcohol use, physical inactivity, sedentary
   behaviour and nutrition-related habits. Poisson regression was used with
   robust variance adjustment to analyse the associations. The analysis was
   stratified by sexes. The prevalence of AO was 32.7\% (girls 36.3\%, boys
   28.4\%). In girls, excessive intake of fried foods was inversely
   associated with AO and excessive consumption of soda was positively
   associated. In boys, the results demonstrated a negative association
   with excessive consumption of sweets and soda.
   Conclusion: It is concluded that the prevalence of AO among adolescents
   was higher in both sexes. AO is associated with different eating habits
   in females and males and these relationships are mediated by familial
   contexts.}},

   What's known on the subject? and What does the study add?
   Prostate biopsy can potentially have fatal outcome. This is, however,
   rare. In the literature a few fatal cases of septicaemia have been
   reported as well as life-threatening rectal bleeding.
   Prostate biopsy is not associated with excess mortality and fatal
   complications seem to be very rare in a screening setting.
   OBJECTIVE
   center dot To assess possible excess mortality associated with prostate
   biopsy among screening participants of the European Randomized Study of
   Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).
   patientS AND METHODS
   center dot From three centres in the ERSPC (Finland, The Netherlands and
   Sweden) 50 194 screened men aged 50.2-78.4 years were prospectively
   followed. A cohort of 12 959 first-time screening-positive men (i.e.
   with biopsy indication) was compared with another cohort of 37 235
   first-time screening-negative men.
   center dot Overall mortality rates (i.e. other cause than prostate
   cancer mortality) were calculated and the 120-day and 1-year cumulative
   mortality were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, with a log-rank
   test for statistical significance.
   center dot Incidence rate ratios (RR) and statistical significance were
   evaluated using Poisson regression analyses, adjusting for age, total
   PSA level, screening centre and whether a biopsy indication was present,
   or whether a biopsy was actually performed or not.
   RESULTS
   center dot There was no statistically significant difference in
   cumulative 120-day other cause mortality between the two groups of men:
   0.24\% (95\% CI, 0.17-0.34) for screening-positive men vs 0.24\% (95\%
   CI, 0.20-0.30) for screening-negative men (P = 0.96). This implied no
   excess mortality for screening-positive men.
   center dot Screening-positive men who were not biopsied (n = 1238) had a
   more than fourfold risk of other cause mortality during the first 120
   days compared to screening-negative men: RR, 4.52 (95\% CI, 2.63-7.74)
   (P < 0.001), adjusted for age, whereas men who were actually biopsied (n
   = 11 721) had half the risk: RR, 0.41 (95\% CI, 0.23-0.73) (P = 0.002),
   adjusted for age.
   center dot Only 14/31 (45\%) of the screening-positive men who died
   within 120 days were biopsied and none died as an obvious complication
   to the biopsy.
   CONCLUSION
   center dot Prostate biopsy is not associated with excess mortality and
   fatal complications appear to be very rare.}},

Abstract = {{It is the aim of the paper to present a new point of view on rotational
   elasticity in a nonlinear setting using orthogonal matrices. The
   proposed model, in the linear approximation, can be compared to the
   well-known equilibrium equations of static linear elasticity. An
   appropriate kinetic energy is identified, and we present a dynamical
   model of rotational elasticity. The propagation of elastic waves in such
   a medium is studied and we find two classes of waves, transversal
   rotational waves and longitudinal rotational waves, both of which are
   solutions of the nonlinear partial differential equations. For certain
   parameter choices, the transversal wave velocity can be greater than the
   longitudinal wave velocity. Moreover, parameter ranges are identified
   where the model describes an auxetic material. However, in all cases the
   potential energy functional is positive definite. Finally, we couple the
   rotational waves to linear elastic waves to study the behaviour of the
   coupled system. We find wave-like solutions to the coupled equations and
   can visualise our results with the help of suitable figures.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{85-96}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the propagation of nonlinear waves in homogenized periodic
   nonlinear hexagonal networks, considering successively 1D and 2D
   situations. Wave analysis is performed on the basis of the construction
   of the effective strain energy density of periodic hexagonal lattices in
   the nonlinear regime. The obtained second order gradient nonlinear
   continuum has two propagation modes: an evanescent subsonic mode that
   disappears after a certain wavenumber and a supersonic mode
   characterized by an increase of the frequency with the wavenumber. For a
   weak nonlinearity, a supersonic mode occurs and the dispersion curves
   lie above the linear dispersion curve (v(P) = v(p0)). For a higher
   nonlinearity, the wave changes from a supersonic to an evanescent
   subsonic mode at s=0.7 and the dispersion curves drops below the linear
   case and vanish for certain values of the wavenumber. An important
   decrease in the frequency occurs for both subsonic and supersonic modes
   when the lattice becomes auxetic, and the longitudinal and shear modes
   become very close to each other. The influence of the lattice
   geometrical parameters of the lattice on the dispersion relations is
   analyzed.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Selection of appropriate channel material is the key to design high
   performance tunnel field effect transistor (TFET), which promises to
   outperform the conventional metal oxide semiconductor field effect
   transistor (MOSFET) in ultra-low energy switching applications. Recently
   discovered atomically thin GeSe, a group IV mono-chalcogenide, can be a
   potential candidate owing to its direct electronic band gap and low
   carrier effective mass. In this work we employ ballistic quantum
   transport model to assess the intrinsic performance limit of monolayer
   GeSe-TFET. We first study the electronic band structure by regular and
   hybrid density functional theory and develop two band k center dot p
   hamiltonian for the material. We find that the complex band wraps itself
   within the conduction band and valence band edges and thus signifies
   efficient band to band tunneling mechanism. We then use the k center dot
   p hamiltonian to calculate self-consistent solution of the transport
   equations within the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism and the
   Poisson's equation based electrostatic potential. Keeping the
   OFF-current fixed at 10 pA/mu m we investigate different static and
   dynamic performance metrics (ON current, energy and delay) under three
   different constant-field scaling rules: 40, 30 and 20 nm/V. Our study
   shows that monolayer GeSe-TFET is scalable till 8 nm while preserving
   ON/OFF current ratio higher than 10(4).}},

Abstract = {{Background: Animal studies suggest that the antibiotic and microglial
   activation inhibitor, minocycline, is likely to have a protective effect
   against the emergence of psychosis but evidence from human studies is
   lacking. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of exposure to
   minocycline during adolescence on the later incidence of severe mental
   illness (SMI).
   Methods: A historical cohort study using electronic primary care data
   was conducted to assess the association between exposure to minocycline
   during adolescence and incidence of SMI. The Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)
   was measured using Poisson regression adjusted for age, gender, time of
   exposure, socioeconomic deprivation status, calendar year and
   co-medications.
   Results: Early minocycline prescription (n=13,248) did not affect the
   incidence of SMI compared with non-prescription of minocycline
   (n=14,393), regardless of gender or whether or not the data were
   filtered according to a minimum exposure period (minimum period: IRR
   0.96; 95\% CI 0.68-1.36; p=0.821; no minimum period: IRR 1.08; 95\% CI

   Conclusions: Exposure to minocycline for acne treatment during
   adolescence appears to have no effect on the incidence of SMI.}},

   influenced during design of these materials. Due to the geometric
   complexity of these structures, additive manufacturing is usually the
   only way to manufacture such a material. Among the others, HP Multijet
   Fusion additive technology with its supportless manufacturing approach
   offers one of the most convenient methods for production of lattice
   structures. Scope of this paper is design and mechanical testing of two
   types of lattice structures, namely body centred cubic structure and
   simple cross structure. Main attention is focused on printability of
   structures with different volume ratio in connection with their
   mechanical performance under uniaxial tensile loading. With respect to
   evaluated data, the cross structure shows more stiff behaviour for the
   same volume ratio and the same orientation in the build space of the
   machine. Body centred cubic structure on the other hand offers higher
   displacement to break.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with the numerical analysis of foam materials. Open cell
   foam is investigated. Numerical simulations enable prediction of failure
   process and assessment of effective properties of the modeled foam
   structures {[}1]. Metal as well as polyurethane foams exhibit
   interesting properties. They are light, possess good acoustic and/or
   magnetic isolation, have ability to absorb energy of vibration and
   impacts {[}2]. They are used for sandwich panels, hit absorbers (i.e. as
   elements of buffer constructions in rail vehicles), fillers of
   construction parts, bodies of vehicles (i.e. floating combat vehicles),
   dividing walls on vessels and others. Specially prepared open cell foams
   demonstrate auxetic properties {[}3] and shape memory effect {[}4]. Such
   materials are very good for seats in aircrafts, which may protect pilots
   and passengers during crashes and restrict heavy backbone injuries.
   Foams are also applied for filtering purposes. Foams themselves or in
   combination with different types of fillers (i.e. elastomers) or ceramic
   reinforcement may be used for impact energy absorbing panels for
   military purposes (protection against explosion shock wave and
   splinters).}},

Abstract = {{The single-crystal elastic moduli of minerals and related materials with
   cubic symmetry have been collected and evaluated. The compiled data set
   covers measurements made over an approximately 70 year period and
   consists of 206 compositions. More than 80\% of the database is
   comprised of silicates, oxides, and halides, and approximately 90\% of
   the entries correspond to one of six crystal structures (garnet,
   rocksalt, spine!, perovskite, sphalerite, and fluorite). Primary data
   recorded are the composition of each material, its crystal structure,
   density, and the three independent nonzero adiabatic elastic moduli
   (C-11 , C-12, and C-44). From these, a variety of additional elastic and
   acoustic properties are calculated and compiled, including
   polycrystalline aggregate elastic properties, sound velocities, and
   anisotropy factors. The database is used to evaluate trends in cubic
   mineral elasticity through consideration of normalized elastic moduli
   (Blackman diagrams) and the Cauchy pressure. The elastic anisotropy and
   auxetic behavior of these materials are also examined. Compilations of
   single-crystal elastic moduli provide a useful tool for investigation
   structure-property relationships of minerals.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulations of mono- and polydisperse two-dimensional
   crystals are reported. The particles in the studied system, interacting
   through hard-core repulsive Yukawa potential, form a solid phase of
   hexagonal lattice. The elastic properties of crystalline Yukawa systems
   are determined in the NpT ensemble with variable shape of the periodic
   box. Effects of the Debye screening length (-1), contact value of the
   potential (epsilon), and the size polydispersity of particles on elastic
   properties of the system are studied. The simulations show that the
   polydispersity of particles strongly influences the elastic properties
   of the studied system, especially on the shear modulus. It is also found
   that the elastic moduli increase with density and their growth rate
   depends on the screening length. Shorter screening length leads to
   faster increase of elastic moduli with density and decrease of the
   Poisson's ratio. In contrast to its three-dimensional version, the
   studied system is non-auxetic, i.e., shows positive Poisson's ratio. (C)

Abstract = {{Bond and site percolation on two- and three-dimensional (3D) elastic and
   superelastic percolation networks with central and bond-bending (BB)
   forces are studied. We calculate the force distribution and show that,
   depending on the relative contributions of the central and BB forces,
   its shape can be unimodal or bimodal, both near and away from the
   percolation threshold p(c). The Poisson ratios of various 2D and 3D,
   isotropic and anisotropic BB models are calculated and are shown to take
   on negative values near p(c). Several experimental realizations of this
   peculiar property are given. We then analyze various experimental data
   on elastic and rheological properties of gel polymers near p(c). The
   scaling laws for elastic properties of gel polmers near p(c) and their
   associated critical exponents f are divided into two groups. In one
   group are physical gels in which the contribution of BB forces to the
   elastic energy dominates that of central forces (CF's), and their
   scaling properties are described by the BB model, with f congruent-to
   3.75. In the second group are chemical gels in most of which CF's are
   dominant, with f congruent-to 2. 1. The scaling laws for the viscosity
   of a gelling solution near the gel point can also be divided into two
   groups. In one group are gelling solutions that are close to the Zimm
   regime. We propose that the scaling properties of the viscosity of such
   gels is analogous to the shear modulus of a static superelastic
   percolation network that diverges, as p(c) is approached from below,
   with an exponent tau = nu-beta(p)/2 congruent-to 0.68 in 3D, where nu
   and beta(p) are the critical exponents of the correlation length and the
   strength of percolation networks, respectively. In the second group are
   gelling solutions that are close to the Rouse limit. We propose that the
   scaling law for the divergence of the viscosity of such gels is the same
   as that of the shear modulus of a dynamic superelastic percolation
   network, with tau' = 2tau congruent-to 1.35 in 3D.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may experience falls and/or

   available from long-term studies estimating the incidence of
   falls/fractures in patients with PD. The objective was to compare the
   incidence rate of falls/fractures in PD patients with non-PD patients in
   a US population. This was a retrospective study using a US-based claims
   database (Truven Health MarketScan (R)) that compared the incidence rate
   of falls/fractures in PD subjects with non-PD subjects. The study period
   included the 12 months prior to index date (defined as earliest PD
   diagnosis {[}International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
   Clinical Modification code 332.0]) and a postindex period to the end of
   data availability. Fractures were defined by inpatient/outpatient claims
   as a principal or secondary diagnosis and accompanying procedure codes
   during the postindex period. Incidence rates and 95\% CIs for
   falls/fractures were calculated as the number of events per 10,000
   person-years of follow-up using negative binomial or Poisson regression
   models. Twenty-eight thousand two hundred and eighty PD subjects were
   matched to non-PD subjects for the analysis (mean {[}SD] age, 71.4
   {[}11.8] years; 53\% male). A higher incidence rate (adjusted for
   comorbidities and medications) of all fall/fracture cases and by fall
   and fracture types was observed for PD subjects versus non-PD subjects;
   the overall adjusted incidence rate ratio comparing PD to non-PD
   subjects was 2.05; 95\% CI, 1.88-2.24. The incidence rate of

Title = {{Community-level risk factors for notifiable gastrointestinal illness in
   the Northwest Territories, Canada, 1991-2008}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JAN 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Enteric pathogens are an important cause of illness,
   however, little is known about their community-level risk factors (e.
   g., socioeconomic, cultural and physical environmental conditions) in
   the Northwest Territories (NWT) of Canada. The objective of this study
   was to undertake ecological (group-level) analyses by combining two
   existing data sources to examine potential community-level risk factors
   for campylobacteriosis, giardiasis and salmonellosis, which are three
   notifiable (mandatory reporting to public health authorities at the time
   of diagnosis) enteric infections.
   Methods: The rate of campylobacteriosis was modeled using a Poisson
   distribution while rates of giardiasis and salmonellosis were modeled
   using a Negative Binomial distribution. Rate ratios (the ratio of the
   incidence of disease in the exposed group to the incidence of disease in
   the non-exposed group) were estimated for infections by the three major
   pathogens with potential community-level risk factors.
   Results: Significant (p <= 0.05) associations varied by etiology. There
   was increased risk of infection with Salmonella for communities with
   higher proportions of `households in core need' (unsuitable, inadequate,
   and/or unaffordable housing) up to 42\% after which the rate started to
   decrease with increasing core need. The risk of giardiasis was
   significantly higher both with increased `internal mobility' (population
   moving between communities), and also where the community's primary
   health facility was a health center rather than a full-service hospital.
   Communities with higher health expenditures had a significantly
   decreased risk of giardiasis. Results of modeling that focused on each
   of Giardia and Salmonella infections separately supported and expanded
   upon previous research outcomes that suggested health disparities are
   often associated with socioeconomic status, geographical and social
   mobility, as well as access to health care (e. g. facilities, services
   and professionals). In the campylobacteriosis model, a negative
   association was found between food prices in communities and risk of
   infection. There was also a significant interaction between trapping and
   consumption of traditional foods in communities. Higher rates of
   community participation in both activities appeared to have a protective
   effect against campylobacteriosis.
   Conclusions: These results raise very interesting questions about the
   role that traditional activities might play in infectious enteric
   disease incidence in the NWT, but should be interpreted with caution,
   recognizing database limitations in collection of case data and risk
   factor information (e. g. missing data). Given the cultural,
   socioeconomic, and nutritional benefits associated with traditional food
   practices, targeted community-based collaborative research is necessary
   to more fully investigate the statistical correlations identified in
   this exploratory research. This study demonstrates the value of
   examining the role of social determinants in the transmission and risk
   of infectious diseases.}},

   and by food group) and MetS using Poisson regression models while
   adjusting for potential confounders.
   Higher organic food consumption was negatively associated with the
   prevalence of MetS: adjusted prevalence ratio was 0.69 (95\% CI 0.61,
   0.78) when comparing the third tertile of proportion of organic food in
   the diet with the first one (p value < 0.0001). Higher consumption of
   organic plant-based foods was also related to a lower probability of
   having MetS. In addition, when stratifying by lifestyle factors
   (nutritional quality of the diet, smoking status, and physical
   activity), a significant negative association was detected in each
   subgroup (p values < 0.05), except among smokers.
   Our results showed that a higher organic food consumption was associated
   with a lower probability of having MetS. Additional prospective studies
   and randomised trials are required to ascertain the relationship between
   organic food consumption and metabolic disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate healthcare utilization in Medicaid enrolled
   children with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in the first 2 years of
   life.
   Study design A retrospective, longitudinal cohort study evaluating
   Medicaid enrolled children born in New York (1999-2011) and Texas
   (1999-2010) was performed. Healthcare utilization, including inpatient
   days, emergency department and outpatient visits, and filled
   prescriptions in children after birth hospitalization was assessed. A
   tapered propensity-matching methodology was used, matching each child
   with NAS with 5 children without NAS, first on demographics, then on
   both demographics and clinical covariates (clinical diagnoses and
   congenital anomalies at birth). Poisson and negative binomial regression
   were used to calculate healthcare utilization ratios (HUR).
   Results In the first 2 years of life, children with NAS (n = 3799) had
   increased healthcare utilization with more inpatient days and emergency
   department visits than demographically similar children without NAS.
   This increased utilization however did not persist after matching on
   clinical covariates and performing multiple comparisons adjustment
   (inpatient days {[}HUR, 1.01; 95\% CI, 0.88-1.16; P = .89], total
   emergency department visits {[}HUR, 1.06; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.11; P = .02]).
   Children with NAS conversely had 9\% fewer outpatient office visits
   (HUR, 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.87-0.95; P < .0001).
   Conclusions A diagnosis of NAS does not appear to be an independent
   predictor of increased healthcare utilization in the first 2 years of
   life. These results differ from some other published studies, but may
   suggest that the increased healthcare utilization observed in children
   with NAS is due to higher incidences of perinatal complications and
   congenital anomalies in children with prenatal drug exposures.}},

Abstract = {{People engaged in informal employment are not insured by any labour or
   social protection. Welfare state regimes could affect the relationship
   between informal employment and health. This study aimed to assess the
   relationship between informal employment and health status in the
   non-agricultural working population in Central America, by welfare state
   regime and gender. Based on a sample of 8680 non-agricultural workers
   (First Central American Survey of Working Conditions and Health), we
   conducted Poisson regression models with robust variance to obtain
   prevalence ratios (PR) and their confidence intervals (95\% CI) of poor
   health status (self-perceived and mental health) of workers with
   informal employment versus those with formal employment. Models were
   adjusted by age and occupation and stratified by welfare state regime
   and gender. We found that prevalence of poor health status was highest
   among women and workers in informal employment. Positive associations
   between informal employment and poor self-perceived health were found in
   familialist and highly familialist countries for both genders, being
   highest in women in familialist countries (PR: 1.39, 95\% CI:
   1.08-1.80). Significant associations were only found for poor mental
   health among women in familialist countries (PR: 1.24, 95\% CI:
   1.01-1.53) and men in highly familialist countries (PR: 1.34, 95\% CI:
   1.00-1.79). Our results suggest that universal social protection
   policies could reduce the negative effects of informal employment on
   health status for both women and men. Future development of labour and
   social policies integrating a gender perspective might be crucial to
   address health inequalities related to informal employment in Latin
   American countries.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes is associated with increased risk of developing colorectal
   cancer (CRC), but its effect on overall and cancer-specific mortality in
   CRC patients has been little investigated. The aim of this study was to
   assess the influence of diabetes on overall and cancer-specific
   mortality in Italian CRC patients.
   Cases of adult (a parts per thousand yen15 years) CRC, diagnosed in
   2003-2005, most followed-up to the end of 2008, were randomly selected
   from the Italian Cancer Registries database. Diabetic status, sex, age,
   tumor stage, subsite, treatment, morphology, and grade were obtained by
   consultation of patient clinical records. Poisson multivariable
   regression models, adjusted for potential confounding variables, were
   used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and CRC-specific
   mortality, according to diabetic status.
   A total of 1,039 CRC cases with known fasting glucose or diabetic
   status, archived in 7 cancer registries, was analyzed. Compared to
   non-diabetics, diabetics (specific diagnosis or glucose a parts per
   thousand yen126 mg/dl) were older and less likely to receive adjuvant
   therapy. Diabetics were at higher risk of all-cause death {[}HR 1.41; 95
   \% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.70] and CRC death (HR 1.36; 95 \% CI
   1.11-1.67), with no differences by sex or subsite.
   Diabetes was significantly associated with increased overall and
   CRC-specific mortality. Our findings indicate that diabetes is a
   negative prognostic factor for CRC and suggest that in patients with
   CRC, diabetes prevention and treatments that stabilize the condition and
   control its complications might reduce mortality. Further studies are
   required to ascertain the mechanisms linking diabetes to greater
   mortality in CRC patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The self-medication hypothesis is commonly put forward to
   explain the high prevalence of smoking in psychiatric patients. However,
   studies supporting the self-medication hypothesis have most often been
   carried out on chronic patients stabilized by antipsychotics. Aim: Given
   that antipsychotics tend to erase psychiatric symptoms, the present
   study was undertaken on acutely ill patients usually receiving no
   medications, or on whom medications are ineffective. Methods:
   Participants were 492 consecutively hospitalized patients. They were
   evaluated the day of their hospitalization with the Brief Psychiatric
   Rating Scale (BPRS, 18 items). Urinary cotinine and creatinine were
   measured the morning following their hospitalization. The urinary
   cotinine/creatinine ratio and the cotinine/creatinine/number of
   cigarettes smoked per day ratio (nicotine extraction index) were
   calculated for each patient. Results: The positive symptoms subscale of
   the BPRS significantly correlated with smoking, whereas other BPRS
   subscales did not. In patients with mood disorder, the nicotine
   extraction index correlated with the positive symptoms, activation and
   hostility subscales, but not with the negative symptoms subscale.
   Analyses of individual BPRS items using the cotinine/creatinine ratio
   measure showed that smoking is positively associated with ``unusual
   thought content{''} and ``grandiosity{''} items and negatively
   associated with ``guilt feeling{''}, ``depressed mood{''} and ``motor
   retardation{''}. Analyses of individual BPRS items using the nicotine
   extraction index showed a positive association only with ``unusual
   thought content{''} and ``grandiosity{''} items. Patients with
   schizophrenia extract more nicotine from cigarettes than other patients.
   Conclusion: In acutely ill psychiatric patients, smoking is linked with
   positive symptoms and not with negative symptoms.}},

   (SpO(2)) both predict clinical severity in sickle cell disease (SCD),
   while reticulocytosis is associated with vasculopathy, but there are few
   data on mechanisms. HbF, SpO(2) and routine clinical and laboratory
   measures were available in a Tanzanian cohort of 1175 SCD individuals
   aged >= 5 years and the association with SpO(2) (as response variable
   transformed to a Poisson distribution) was assessed by negative binomial
   model with age and sex as covariates. Increase in HbF was associated
   with increased SpO(2) (rate ratio, RR = 1.19; 95\% confidence intervals
   {[}CI] 1.04, 1.37 per natural log unit of HbF; p = 0.0004). In
   univariable analysis, SpO(2) was inversely associated with age,
   reticulocyte count, and log (total bilirubin) and directly with pulse,
   SBP, hemoglobin, and log(HbF). In multivariable regression log(HbF) (RR
   1.191; 95\% CI 1.04, 1.37; p = 0.013), pulse (RR 1.01; 95\% CI 1.00,
   1.01; p = 0.026), SBP (RR 1.008; 95\% CI 1.00, 1.02; p = 0.014), and
   hemoglobin (1.120; 95\% CI 1.05, 1.19; p = 0.001) were positively and
   independently associated with SpO(2) while reticulocyte count (RR 0.985;
   95\% CI 0.97, 0.99; p = 0.019) was independently inversely associated
   with SpO(2). In SCD, improving SpO(2), in part through cardiovascular
   compensation and associated with reduced reticulocytosis, may be a
   mechanism by which HbF reduces disease severity. (C) 2017 Published by

Abstract = {{AimThe present study examined whether knee pain was associated with
   decline in maximum gait speed (MGS) in a rural mountainous region.
   MethodsThis was a population-based 1-year prospective cohort study. A
   total of 658 men and women aged 60years and older participated in the
   baseline survey in 2006, and 400 individuals participated in the
   follow-up survey in 2007. We compared the incidence of meaningful
   decline in gait speed (0.1m/s) in older adults with different knee pain
   levels (none, mild, severe), estimating incidence rate ratio (IRR) by
   multivariable-adjusted Poisson regression model.
   ResultsMeaningful decline in MGS presented in 24.3\% of participants,
   especially in men (30.3\%). Baseline knee pain level was significantly
   related to meaningful decline in MGS after adjustment of potential
   confounders (IRR 1.79 for mild pain, 1.84 for severe pain; P for trend
   <0.01). In sensitivity analyses with change in MGS as the continuous
   variable, the association was not significant, but a similar negative
   association with knee pain was confirmed (mild pain =-0.040, severe pain
   =-0.088; P for trend=0.104). In addition, older adults with knee pain at
   both baseline and follow up had a higher risk of meaningful decline in
   MGS (IRR 2.33, 95\% CI 1.59-3.40) compared with those who had no pain at
   baseline or follow up.
   ConclusionsKnee pain was associated with a decline in gait speed at
   1-year follow up. Prevention and treatment of knee pain might be
   important for suppression of decline in physical function in older
   adults. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 55-64.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to describe the
   epidemiology of reportable enteric illness in Ontario's Waterloo region,
   including comparing calculated incidence rates with published rates, and
   adjusting for under-reporting to determine the number of community
   cases, where published data were available.
   METHODS: Descriptive analyses were performed on reportable disease data
   for 13 enteric diseases collected in the Waterloo region from 1990 to
   2004. Poisson and negative binomial regression analyses were used to
   investigate differences in incidence rates among age, sex, the 15 years
   of data and seasons. Disease-specific incidence rates were calculated
   and compared with the literature, where possible. Under-reporting ratios
   from the literature were applied to estimate the number of cases of
   campylobacteriosis, nontyphoidal salmonellosis and verotoxigenic
   Escherichia coli infection at the community level.
   RESULTS: Over the study period, the average annual age- and sex-adjusted
   incidence rates per 100,000 population were highest for
   campylobacteriosis (49.69 cases), followed by giardiasis (31.87 cases)
   and nontyphoidat salmonellosis (25.97 cases). The incidence of most
   enteric illnesses peaked in the summer. The highest incidence occurred
   in young children, followed by adults in their 20s. Diarrhea (85.4\%)
   was the most frequently reported symptom, food (57.4\%) was the most
   commonly reported probable source, and home (41.7\%) and travel (37.0\%)
   were the two most frequently reported risk settings.
   CONCLUSIONS: Enteric illness was a significant health burden in the
   Waterloo region from 1990 to 2004. Because reportable disease data are
   subject to under-reporting, it is likely that the true burden is greater
   than estimated in the present study.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of
   malocclusion on children's oral health-related quality of life (COHRQoL)
   and self-reported happiness.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a representative
   sample of 12-year-old schoolchildren from Santa Maria, South Brazil.
   Four calibrated examiners carried out clinical exams to evaluate
   malocclusion {[}Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI)], dental caries (DMFT), and
   dental trauma (O'Brien classification, used in the Children's dental
   health survey in the UK, 1994). Participants answered the Brazilian
   versions of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ(11-14)) and the
   Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS). Parents completed a structured
   questionnaire regarding socioeconomic status. Data analysis was
   conducted using multilevel Poisson regression models.
   Results: A total of 1,134 adolescents (boys: 45.8 percent; girls: 54.1
   percent) were enrolled in the study. The DAI overall score ranged from
   13 to 63 (mean: 25.19, standard error: 0.19); 57.6 percent of the
   subjects had minor or no malocclusion and 24.4 percent had definite
   malocclusion. Severe malocclusion and handicapping malocclusion were
   found in 10.4 percent and 7.4 percent of the subjects, respectively.
   After adjustment, the severity of malocclusion was associated with high
   mean values of the CPQ11-14 overall score, and the emotional well-being
   and social well-being domains were the most affected. Lower levels of
   happiness were also associated with the severity of malocclusion: those
   with definite malocclusion presented lower scores on the SHS scale (Rate
   Ratio 0.97; 95 percent CI 0.94-0.99).
   Conclusion: Malocclusion had a negative impact on COHRQoL and happiness,
   mainly on the emotional and social domains.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To compare the efficacy of emicizumab prophylaxis with that
   of factor VIII (FVIII) prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A without
   inhibitors using two approaches: network meta-analyses (NMA) and
   additional sub-group analyses from the HAVEN 3 trial. Methods: The NMA
   used data from trials identified using a systematic literature review
   and compared bleed rates in patients receiving emicizumab prophylaxis
   and patients receiving FVIII prophylaxis using a Bayesian, random
   effects generalized linear model with log link Poisson likelihood.
   Additional sub-groups of the HAVEN 3 trial included here were defined as
   patients whose dose-taking behavior met either European label or World
   Federation of Hemophilia guidelines. A negative binomial regression
   model was used to conduct an intra-patient comparison of bleed rates
   within the sub-groups, during treatment with FVIII prophylaxis before
   entering HAVEN 3 and treatment with emicizumab prophylaxis during HAVEN
   3. Results: Four studies were included in the base-case NMA. Evidence
   showed that the total treated bleed rate was lower with emicizumab
   prophylaxis compared with FVIII prophylaxis (rate ratio {[}RR] = 0.36
   {[}95\% credible interval (CrI) = 0.13-0.95]). Similar associations were
   observed in sensitivity analyses. The additional HAVEN 3 analyses also
   showed lower rates of treated bleeds with emicizumab prophylaxis than
   with FVIII prophylaxis (RRs {[}95\% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.380
   {[}0.186-0.790] and 0.472 {[}0.258-0.866] in two sub-groups). These
   results confirm the original HAVEN 3 intra-patient comparison findings.
   Conclusions: Combined findings from NMA and additional sub-group
   analyses of HAVEN 3 support the superiority of emicizumab prophylaxis
   over FVIII prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A without inhibitors.}},

   -0.007) and birth trauma (0.937, 95\% CI 0.907 to 0.968). The trend for
   small for gestational age (SGA) among women with GDM increased by an
   odds ratio per year (1.016, 95\% CI 1.002 to 1.029). No significant
   interaction tests for maternal characteristics were found. Trends in
   outcomes for women without diabetes were similar to those for women with
   GDM. Conclusions This study shows that there were improvements in
   pregnancy outcomes for women with GDM between 1998 and 2012, although
   the incidence of SGA increased. Improvements followed similar trends in
   the background population. Inequalities in obstetric outcomes between
   women with GDM and those without have continued unchanged over 15 years,
   suggesting that new management strategies are required to reduce this
   gap.}},

Abstract = {{Background Social features of neighbourhood environments may influence
   smoking by creating a stressful environment or by buffering stress
   through social cohesion. However, the association of the overall
   neighbourhood social environment (NSE) with smoking, and the association
   of specific neighbourhood social factors with change in smoking
   behaviour over time, has rarely been examined.
   Methods This study included 5856 adults aged 45-84 years from the
   Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (2000-2012, average follow-up: 7.8
   years). Outcomes included current smoking status and smoking intensity
   (average number of cigarettes smoked per day among baseline smokers).
   NSE was assessed as a composite score composed of aesthetic quality,
   safety and social cohesion scales (derived from neighbourhood surveys).
   Generalised linear mixed models evaluated the association of baseline
   NSE (composite score and individual scales) with current smoking
   (modified Poisson models) and smoking intensity (negative binomial
   models) cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
   Results Each SD increase in baseline NSE composite score was associated
   with 13\% lower prevalence of smoking at baseline (adjusted prevalence
   ratio (aPR) 0.87 (95\% CI 0.78 to 0.98). Neighbourhood safety and
   aesthetic quality were similarly associated with lower smoking
   prevalence (aPR 0.87 (0.78 to 0.97) and aPR 0.87 (0.77 to 0.99),
   respectively) but the association with social cohesion was weaker or
   null. No significant associations were observed for smoking intensity
   among baseline smokers. Baseline NSE was not associated with changes in
   smoking risk or intensity over time.
   Conclusions Results suggest that neighbourhood social context influences
   whether older adults smoke, but does not promote smoking cessation or
   reduction over time.}},

Title = {{Anemia among Primary School Children in Eastern Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Anemia during childhood impairs physical growth, cognitive development
   and school performance. Identifying the causes of anemia in specific
   contexts can help efforts to prevent negative consequences of anemia
   among children. The objective of this study was to assess prevalence and
   identify correlates of anemia among school children in Eastern Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A cross sectional study was conducted from January 2012 to February 2012
   in Kersa, Eastern Ethiopia. The study included randomly selected primary
   school students. Hemoglobin concentration was measured using a Hemocue
   haemoglobinometer. A child was identified as anemic if the hemoglobin
   concentration was < 11.5 g/dl for children (5-11 yrs) and < 12 g/dl for
   child older than 12 years age. Poisson regression model with robust
   variance was used to calculate prevalence ratios.
   Result
   The overall prevalence of anemia was 27.1\% (95\% CI: 24.98, 29.14):
   13.8\% had mild, 10.8\% moderate, and 2.3\% severe anemia. Children with
   in the age group of 5-9 years (APR, 1.083; 95\% CI, 1.044-1.124) were at
   higher risk for anemia. Paternal education (Illiterate, 1.109; 1.044
   -1.178) was positively associated with anemia. Children who had
   irregular legume consumption (APR, 1.069; 95\% CI, 1.022 -1.118) were at
   higher risk for anemia.
   Conclusion
   About a quarter of school children suffer from anemia and their
   educational potential is likely to be affected especially for those with
   moderate and severe anemia. Child age, irregular legume consumption, and
   low paternal schooling were associated with anemia. Intervention
   programmes aimed to reduce anemia among school children are crucial to
   ensure proper growth and development of children.}},

Title = {{Mood disorders, childhood maltreatment, and medical morbidity in US
   adults: An observational study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{137}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Mood disorders, child maltreatment, and medical morbidity are
   associated with enormous public health burden and individual suffering.
   The effect of mood disorders on medical morbidity, accounting for child
   maltreatment, has not been studied prospectively in a large,
   representative sample of community-dwelling US adults. This study tested
   the effects of mood disorders and child maltreatment on medical
   morbidity, and variation by subtypes. Methods: Participants were
   noninstitutionalized US adults in the National Epidemiologic Survey on
   Alcohol and Related Conditions (N = 43,093 wave 1, N = 34,653 wave 2).
   Mood disorders included lifetime DSM-IV episodes of depression,
   dysthymia, mania, or hypomania. Child maltreatment was defined as
   sexual, physical, or emotional abuse, or physical or emotional neglect
   before age 18. Survey-weighted zero-inflated poisson regression was used
   to study effects on medical morbidity, a summary score of 11
   self-reported medical conditions. Results were adjusted for age, sex,
   ethnicity/race, income, substance use disorders, smoking, and obesity.
   Results: Mood disorders and child maltreatment additively associated
   with medical morbidity at study entry and three years later, with
   similar magnitude as obesity and smoking. Mania/hypomania (incidence
   rate ratio {[}IRR] 1.06, 95\% CI 1.01-1.10) and child sexual (IRR 1.08,
   95\% CI 1.04-1.11) and emotional (IRR 1.05, 95\% CI 1.01-1.10) abuse
   were associated with higher medical morbidity longitudinally.
   Conclusions: Child maltreatment is common, and its long-range negative
   effect on medical morbidity underscores the importance of
   trauma-informed care, and consideration of early life exposures. History
   of mania/ hypomania should be considered in medical practice, and
   physical health must be emphasized in mental health care.}},

Abstract = {{Background: polypharmacy is an important risk factor for falls, but
   recent studies suggest only when including medications associated with
   increasing the risk of falls.
   Design: a prospective, population-based cohort study.
   Subjects: 6,666 adults aged a parts per thousand yen50 years from The
   Irish Longitudinal study on Ageing.
   Methods: participants reported regular medication use at baseline. Any
   subsequent falls, any injurious falls and the number of falls were
   reported 2 years later. The association between polypharmacy (> 4
   medications) or fall risk-increasing medications and subsequent falls or
   injurious falls was assessed using modified Poisson regression. The
   association with the number of falls was assessed using negative
   binomial regression.
   Results: during follow-up, 231 falls per 1,000 person-years were
   reported. Polypharmacy including antidepressants was associated with a
   greater risk of any fall (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.28, 95\% CI
   1.06-1.54), of injurious falls (aRR 1.51, 95\% CI 1.10-2.07) and a
   greater number of falls (adjusted incident rate ratio (aIRR) 1.60, 95\%
   CI 1.19-2.15), but antidepressant use without polypharmacy and
   polypharmacy without antidepressants were not. The use of
   benzodiazepines was associated with injurious falls when coupled with
   polypharmacy (aRR 1.40, 95\% CI 1.04-1.87), but was associated with a
   greater number of falls (aIRR 1.32, 95\% CI 1.05-1.65), independent of
   polypharmacy. Other medications assessed, including antihypertensives,
   diuretics and antipsychotics, were not associated with outcomes.
   Conclusion: in middle-aged and older adults, polypharmacy, including
   antidepressant or benzodiazepine use, was associated with injurious
   falls and a greater number of falls.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The present cross-sectional study evaluated the quality of
   life of patients treated with 3-D conformal radiotherapy for cancer of
   the mouth, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx and investigated possible
   associations with clinical and sociodemographic variables using
   multivariate analysis. Methods The sample was composed of 90 patients
   who had completed treatment at least 3 months earlier. Data were
   collected from April 2016 to May 2017. The patients were clinically
   evaluated with regard to stimulated salivary flow, trismus, and
   radiation caries. Sociodemographic data and data related to the disease
   (stage, location of primary tumor, and radiation dose) were collected
   from the patient charts. Quality of life was assessed using the
   Brazilian version of the University of Washington Quality of Life
   (UW-QOL) questionnaire. Poisson logistic regression was performed to
   determine the mean ratio and test associations with the clinical and
   sociodemographic variables. Results The mean total of the UW-QOL was
   814.88 (+/- 224.58). Patient age, staging of cancer, hyposalivation, and
   trismus were associated with quality of life. Patients with tumors in
   the advanced stage, those with hyposalivation and those with trismus
   respectively had 11\% (CI 0.80-0.98), 12\% (CI 0.79-0.99), and 15\% (CI
   0.77-0.94) lower UW-QOL scores, indicating poorer quality of life.
   Conclusion Survivors of head and neck cancer experience a negative
   impact on quality of life associated with trismus, hyposalivation,
   advanced stage tumors, and a younger patient age. The present findings
   underscore the importance of a specific approach focused on these
   aspects to ensure better quality of life in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with the majority
   of anal high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) and anal cancers.
   Little is known about the risk of anal cancer following a diagnosis of
   benign anal disease and AIN.
   Methods: Using data from nationwide, population-based Danish registries,
   a cohort of 126,174 individuals with either non-neoplastic anal disease
   or AIN 1 to 3 during 1970 to 2016 was followed until first occasion of
   anal cancer. Information on HIV status was obtained from the Danish HIV
   Cohort Study. The absolute risk of anal cancer was estimated using the
   Aalen-Johansen estimator taking into account censoring at emigration and
   end of follow-up and competing risk at time of death. Standardized
   incidence ratios (SIR) for anal cancer among individuals with
   non-neoplastic anal disease, including inflammatory lesions,
   hemorrhoids, and polyps, were estimated in Poisson models. Sex-, age-,
   and calendar period-specific national population rates were estimated
   using the Danish National Pathology Registry.
   Results: Anal cancer risk increased with increasing severity of lesions,
   reaching 4\% 5 years after diagnosis of AIN3. Even among those with
   non-neoplastic anal lesions, particularly inflammatory lesions, anal
   cancer risk was significantly higher than expected from Danish national
   anal cancer rates (SIR = 2.8; 95\% confidence intervals, 2.3-3.2). The
   absolute 5-year risk of anal cancer following AIN3 was considerably
   higher among HIV-positive (14.1\%) than HIV-negative (3.2\%)
   individuals.
   Conclusions: Anal cancer risk increases with increasing severity of
   lesions and is especially high among HIV-positive individuals.
   Impact: Vaccination against HPV is important in the prevention of both
   high-grade AIN and anal cancer.}},

Title = {{Social network types and functional dependency in older adults in Mexico}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Social networks play a key role in caring for older adults.
   A better understanding of the characteristics of different social
   networks types (TSNs) in a given community provides useful information
   for designing policies to care for this age group. Therefore this study
   has three objectives: 1) To derive the TSNs among older adults
   affiliated with the Mexican Institute of Social Security; 2) To describe
   the main characteristics of the older adults in each TSN, including the
   instrumental and economic support they receive and their satisfaction
   with the network; 3) To determine the association between functional
   dependency and the type of social network.
   Methods: Secondary data analysis of the 2006 Survey of Autonomy and
   Dependency (N = 3,348). The TSNs were identified using the structural
   approach and cluster analysis. The association between functional
   dependency and the TSNs was evaluated with Poisson regression with
   robust variance analysis in which socio-demographic characteristics,
   lifestyle and medical history covariates were included.
   Results: We identified five TSNs: diverse with community participation
   (12.1\%), diverse without community participation (44.3\%); widowed
   (32.0\%); nonfriends-restricted (7.6\%); nonfamily-restricted (4.0\%).
   Older adults belonging to widowed and restricted networks showed a
   higher proportion of dependency, negative self-rated health and
   depression. Older adults with functional dependency more likely belonged
   to a widowed network (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.5; 95\% CI: 1.1-2.1).
   Conclusion: The derived TSNs were similar to those described in
   developed countries. However, we identified the existence of a diverse
   network without community participation and a widowed network that have
   not been previously described. These TSNs and restricted networks
   represent a potential unmet need of social security affiliates.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Mycoplasma genitalium can result in pelvic inflammatory
   disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. We analyzed data collected from
   a prospective study of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV) to
   determine the natural history of M. genitalium.
   Methods. Women aged 15-25 years, with asymptomatic BV and >= 2 risk
   factors for sexually transmitted infection were recruited from 10 sites
   throughout the United States. Vaginal swab samples were collected at
   enrollment and through home-based testing every 2 months over 12 months.
   M. genitalium nucleic acid amplification testing was performed for M.
   genitalium using transcription- mediated assays (Hologic). The
   prevalence, incidence, and persistence of M. genitalium, defined as all
   positive specimens during follow-up, were estimated with 95\% confidence
   intervals (CIs). Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) were calculated using
   logistic and Poisson regression to evaluate participant characteristics
   associated with M. genitalium infection.
   Results. Among 1139 women, 233 were M. genitalium positive, for a
   prevalence of 20.5\% (95\% CI, 18.2\%-22.9\%); 42 of 204 had persistent
   M. genitalium (20.6\%). Among 801 M. genitalium-negative women at
   baseline, the M. genitalium incidence was 36.6 per 100 person-years
   (95\% CI, 32.4-41.3). Black race (AOR, 1.92; 95\% CI, 1.09-3.38), age <=
   21 years (1.40; 1.03-1.91), and prior pregnancy (1.36; 1.00-1.85) were
   associated with prevalent M. genitalium; only black race was associated
   with incident M. genitalium (P =.03).
   Conclusions. We identified high rates of prevalent, incident, and
   persistent M. genitalium infections among young, high-risk women with
   asymptomatic BV, supporting the need for clinical trials to evaluate the
   impact of M. genitalium screening on female reproductive health
   outcomes.}},

   Generation}},
Journal = {{HEALTH PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Image reconstruction algorithms were developed for radiation source
   mapping and used for generating the search path of a moving radiation
   detector, such as one onboard an unmanned aerial vehicle. Simulations
   consisted of first assuming radioactive sources of varying complexity
   and estimating the radiation fields that would then be produced by that
   source distribution. Next, the ``measurements{''} that would result from
   a pair of adjacent spatial locations were computed. A crude estimate of
   the source distribution likely to have produced such ``measurements{''}
   was reconstructed based upon the limited measurements. Location of the
   next ``measurement{''} was then determined as halfway between the
   location of the estimated source and the current ``measurement.{''} With
   each additional sample, improved source distribution reconstructions
   were made and used to inform the immediate direction of detector motion.
   Source reconstruction or mapping was formulated as an inverse problem
   solved with either maximum a posteriori or least squares (LS) regression
   deconvolution methods. Different amounts of noise were added to the
   simulated ``measurements,{''} allowing evaluation of the methods'
   performances as functions of signal-to-noise ratio of the measured map.
   As expected, methods that promote sparsity were better suited in
   reconstructing point sources. Reliable prior information of the source
   distribution also improved the reconstruction results, especially with
   distributed sources. With a non-negative least square algorithm and the
   suggested paths it generated, location of sources was successfully
   estimated to an accuracy of 0.014 m within nine iterations in a
   single-source scenario and 12 iterations in a two-source scenario, given
   a 10\% error on the integrated counts and a Poisson distribution of the
   noise associated with the measured counts.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To investigate the association between illness perceptions
   and disability both cross-sectionally and over 2 years in patients with
   hand OA.
   Methods. Illness perceptions and self-reported disability were assessed
   at baseline and after 2 years in 384 patients with primary hand OA (mean
   age 61 years, 84\% women, n = 312 with follow-up) with the Illness
   Perception Questionnaire - Revised (IPQ-R), Functional Index for Hand
   OA, Australian/Canadian Hand OA Index and HAQ. Risk ratios for high
   disability (highest quartile) at both time points were estimated for
   tertiles of IPQ-R dimensions, using Poisson regression. The mean IPQ
   dimension change difference between patients with and without disability
   progression (change Functional Index for Hand OA >= 1,
   Australian/Canadian Hand OA Index> 1.4, HAQ> 0.22) was estimated with
   linear regression. Analyses were adjusted for age, Doyle index and
   baseline score.
   Results. At baseline, stronger negative illness perceptions were
   associated with high disability. Baseline illness perceptions were also
   associated with high disability after 2 years, although adjustment made
   apparent that these associations were confounded by baseline disability
   status. Most illness perceptions changed over 2 years; understanding
   increased, OA was regarded as more chronic and fewer emotions and
   consequences and less personal and treatment control were experienced.
   The 2 year change in disability was different between patients with and
   without progression for the illness perceptions of more perceived
   consequences, symptoms, treatment control and emotions.
   Conclusion. Illness perceptions seemed to be implicated in disability
   and its progression. Our results suggest that interventions could focus
   on improving baseline disability, potentially using illness perceptions
   to accomplish this goal.}},

   rate reported during the third trimester (IRR, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.35-0.64)
   for all ages; no increased risk of acute appendicitis was observed in
   the postpartum period compared with the time outside pregnancy among
   women aged 15 to 34 years but an 84\% increased risk for women older
   than 35 years (IRR, 1.84; 95\% CI, 1.18-2.86). The highest and lowest
   rates of negative appendectomy were encountered in the second and the
   third trimesters, respectively.
   Conclusions: Pregnant women are less likely to be diagnosed with acute
   appendicitis than nonpregnant women, with the lowest risk reported
   during the third trimester.}},

Abstract = {{Although some studies suggest that conformity with consensus
   recommendations for breast cancer therapy is associated with increased
   survival, the data are not clear. We identified patients in four
   hospital-based breast cancer registries in Korea who had undergone
   primary curative surgery (stage 0-III) from 1993 through 2002 (n =
   8,407). We collected demographic and clinical characteristics such as
   age, stage, treatment, and hormone receptor status. We gathered
   1993-2004 mortality data by linkage to the National Statistical Office.
   During the follow-up period of 43,145 person-years (mean, 5.13 years),
   we identified 899 deceased cases. We used the standard Poisson
   regression model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for survival in
   relation to conformity with guidelines for chemo-, hormone, and
   locoregional therapy. Guideline compliance for systemic therapy
   increased from 24.0\% in 1993 to 83.8\% in 2002. Among mastectomy
   patients with < 4 positive lymph nodes and tumors < 5 cm,
   post-mastectomy radiotherapy was associated with poor survival (HR 2.07;
   95\% CI: 1.53-2.81). Tamoxifen use was associated with better survival
   among patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors (HR 0.57; 95\% CI:
   0.45-0.73) and with poorer survival among hormone receptor-negative
   patients who had affected nodes (HR 1.58; 95\% CI: 1.01-2.44). Relative
   to conformity, non-conformity with both chemo- and hormone therapy
   guidelines was associated with a 76\% higher risk of death. Compliance
   with consensus recommendations for chemo- and hormone therapy is
   significantly associated with better survival. Overuse of
   post-mastectomy radiotherapy and tamoxifen beyond the consensus
   recommendations may be harmful.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Studies assessing Spanish smoke-free laws have found a
   decrease in second-hand smoke exposure, but the impact of such laws on
   general smoking trends is not clear. This study proposes to analyse
   trends in the prevalence of smoking in Spain, including changes by
   educational level, following the implementation of smokefree regulations
   (2005 and 2010). Methods: Seven editions of the Spanish Household Survey
   on Alcohol and Drugs from 1999 to 2011 were used to analyse the
   standardised prevalence of daily smokers, the proportion of ex-daily
   smokers, and the average cigarettes smoked daily in both sexes and by
   educational level, among the population aged 15-64. The annual
   percentage of change (APC), and Poisson and linear multiple regressions
   were used to identify differences in terms of years and educational
   levels. Results: The overall prevalence of Spanish daily smokers
   decreased from 33.5\% in 1999 to 30.2\% in 2011 (APC = -1.7\% for men,
   APC = -1.0\% for women). Differences between low and high educational
   levels in the prevalence of daily smokers and ex-daily smokers
   increased. For both sexes, the prevalence ratio (PR) of daily smokers
   was positive for the years before 2005 and negative afterwards.
   Conversely, for ex-daily smokers the PR in all years was lower than in
   2005. The mean number of cigarettes decreased from 17.6 cig/day in 1999
   to 14.2 in 2011 {[}APC= day 1.8 (95\% confidence interval: day 2.2, day
   1.3)]. Conclusion: Six years after the national smoke-free regulation
   was implemented, previously reported decreasing trends of smoking for
   both men and women persisted, while inequalities between educational
   levels increased in both sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Frequent or severe headaches are associated with school
   absenteeism and functional limitation in children, but trends in
   headache prevalence are uncertain. We used nationally representative
   data to describe trends in pediatric headache prevalence in the United
   States, and to evaluate whether headache has remained consistently
   associated with functional limitations among school-age children.
   Methods. We analyzed data on children age 5 to 17 years in the 2007 to
   2015 National Health Interview Surveys. Caregivers reported whether each
   child experienced frequent or severe headache in the past 12 months.
   Weighted proportions and multivariable regression were used to estimate
   headache prevalence over the study period and associations between
   headache and measures of functional limitation. Results. The analysis
   included 57 272 children (mean age = 11 years; 52\% female). Frequent or
   severe headache was reported for 6\% of children, with no discernable
   trend over the study period. On multivariable Poisson regression,
   headache became more strongly associated with school absenteeism over
   time. In 2007, frequent or severe headache was associated with a 70\%
   increase in the number of missed school days (incidence risk ratio
   {[}IRR] = 1.70; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.50-1.91; P < .001),
   whereas by 2015, headache was associated with a 139\% increase in the
   number of missed school days (IRR = 2.39; 95\% CI = 2.02-2.83; P <
   .001). Conclusion. Though the prevalence of frequent or severe headache
   in school-age children did not change in 2007 to 2015, headache became
   more strongly associated with school absenteeism, highlighting the need
   for improved management of patients with headaches to prevent negative
   impact on school performance and functional status.}},

Abstract = {{Background Countries with a similar expenditure on healthcare within
   Europe exhibit differences in lung cancer survival. Survival in lung
   cancer was studied in 2001-2004 in England, Norway and Sweden.
   Methods Nationwide cancer registries in England, Norway and Sweden were
   used to identify 250 828 patients with lung cancer from England, 18 386
   from Norway and 24 886 from Sweden diagnosed between 1996 and 2004,
   after exclusion of patients registered through death certificate only or
   with missing, zero or negative survival times. 5-Year relative survival
   was calculated by application of the period approach. The excess
   mortality between the countries was compared using a Poisson regression
   model.
   Results In all subcategories of age, sex and follow-up period, the
   5-year survival was lower in England than in Norway and Sweden. The
   age-standardised survival estimates were 6.5\%, 9.3\% and 11.3\% for men
   and 8.4\%, 13.5\% and 15.9\% for women in the respective countries in
   2001-2004. The difference in excess risk of dying between the countries
   was predominantly confined to the first year of follow-up. The relative
   excess risk ratio during the first 3 months of follow-up comparing
   England with Norway 2001-2004 varied between 1.23 and 1.46, depending on
   sex and age, and between 1.56 and 1.91 comparing England with Sweden.
   Conclusion Access to healthcare and population awareness are likely to
   be major reasons for the differences, but it cannot be excluded that
   diagnostic and therapeutic activity play a role. Future improvements in
   lung cancer management may be seen early in follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Morbidity and mortality fromcardiovascular diseases have
   decreased since the 1970s inmostWestern societies. However, it is
   unclear if this positive trend can also be found in younger women
   suffering from acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
   Methods: This is a prospective single center registry study including
   11.015 women and men hospitalized for a first ACS between the years 2001
   and 2010. We analyzed ACS rates according to sex and age group using
   Poisson regression in order to assess temporal trends.
   Results: Overall ACS hospitalization rates per 100.000 inhabitants
   increased by 31\% between 2001 and 2010 (Rate Ratio (RR) of 1.31, 95\%
   CI 1.20-1.43; p < 0.001) with a similar increase in men (RR 1.29, p <
   0.00001) andwomen (RR 1.35, p < 0.0001). Analyses of age-specific ACS
   rates showed a significant increase in ACS hospitalization rates only
   for the age groups 70-79 years (p = 0.003) and 80+ years (p < 0.00001).
   None of the age matched subgroups showed a sex related significant
   difference in trend for ACS hospitalization rates. Temporal trends for
   recorded risk factors showed a significant increase in smoking (p =
   0.03), and a trend to increased obesity prevalence (p = 0.06) in females
   in the age group 60-69 years.
   Conclusions: In contrast to other studies, we found no evidence for a
   particular increase in the number of younger women referred for a first
   ACS during the years 2001 and 2010. Potential negative effects of
   smoking and obesity on ACS incidence may be delayed to women older than
   70 years. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

   surgical treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), where a covered
   stent is implanted to prevent blood flow in the aneurysm sac. Although
   current EVAR is an effective technique, it requires long-term monitoring
   for the post-operative complications (e.g., endoleak, stent occlusion),
   which usually requires expensive radiologic imaging techniques such as
   ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI). In this paper, we present an accessible and continuous post-EVAR
   surveillance scheme by developing a smart stent that features ultrasonic
   powering, blood flow sensing, and integrated wireless electronics. As
   the body of the smart stent, a piezoelectric membrane with a custom pore
   architecture is utilized. The benefits of the embedded pore
   architectures include the expansion and contraction to comply with a
   minimally invasive procedure and enhanced ultrasonic powering and
   sensing capability. The smart stent is able to expand up to 112 \&
   x0025; in diameter when stretched due to the negative Poisson \& x2019;s
   ratio. The ultrasound generates 0.23 mW of electrical power, which can
   sufficiently operate a low power wireless electronics. A comprehensive
   operation of the smart stent is demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic>.
   The integrated flow sensor can measure blood flow ranging between 30
   mL/min to 980 mL/min with an average sensitivity of 0.11 mV/mL/min. The
   wireless electronics transmit and receive such blood flow rate data by
   modulating the carrier frequency from 81 to 88 MHz from 1 m away. The
   developed smart stent prototype is the first step towards minimizing
   post-EVAR complications by providing early and frequent access to
   diagnostic information to patients and physicians.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: The efficiency of prehospital care chain
   response and the adequacy of hospital resources are challenged amid the
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, with suspected
   consequences for patients with ischemic stroke eligible for mechanical
   thrombectomy (MT). Methods: We conducted a prospective national-level
   data collection of patients treated with MT, ranging 45 days across
   epidemic containment measures instatement, and of patients treated
   during the same calendar period in 2019. The primary end point was the
   variation of patients receiving MT during the epidemic period. Secondary
   end points included care delays between onset, imaging, and groin
   puncture. To analyze the primary end point, we used a Poisson regression
   model. We then analyzed the correlation between the number of MTs and
   the number of COVID-19 cases hospitalizations, using the Pearson
   correlation coefficient (compared with the null value). Results: A total
   of 1513 patients were included at 32 centers, in all French
   administrative regions. There was a 21\% significant decrease (0.79;
   {[}95\%CI, 0.76-0.82];P<0.001) in MT case volumes during the epidemic
   period, and a significant increase in delays between imaging and groin
   puncture, overall (mean 144.9 +/- SD 86.8 minutes versus 126.2 +/-
   70.9;P<0.001 in 2019) and in transferred patients (mean 182.6 +/- SD
   82.0 minutes versus 153.25 +/- 67;P<0.001). After the instatement of
   strict epidemic mitigation measures, there was a significant negative
   correlation between the number of hospitalizations for COVID and the
   number of MT cases (R-2-0.51;P=0.04). Patients treated during the COVID
   outbreak were less likely to receive intravenous thrombolysis and to
   have unwitnessed strokes (bothP<0.05). Conclusions: Our study showed a
   significant decrease in patients treated with MTs during the first
   stages of the COVID epidemic in France and alarming indicators of
   lengthened care delays. These findings prompt immediate consideration of
   local and regional stroke networks preparedness in the varying contexts
   of COVID-19 pandemic evolution.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical responses of two novel kinds of two-dimensional (2D)
   mechanical metamaterials containing opposite or parallel snapping curved
   (U-shaped) segments with elastic snap-through instability mechanism are
   systematically investigated. Under uniaxial loading, the metamaterials
   undergo a large deformation caused by stiffness mismatch between
   snapping (buckling instabilities) and supporting (relative
   stiffer/thicker) components, exhibiting very small transverse
   deformation after every snapping. Based on the multi-stable mechanism,
   phase transformation/shape-reconfiguration and zero Poisson's ratio are
   achieved up to large morphological change. Nonlinear mechanical
   responses including self-recovering snapping and multi-stability
   enabling snapping behaviors can be generated by tuning the geometric
   parameters (the relative thickness of the snapping and supporting
   segments as well as the amplitude of the snapping curved segments). Then
   topology analysis is carried out to develop the 2D structures to a
   series of 3D hierarchical configurations from which can be chosen for
   various engineering conditions with enhanced snapping mechanism.
   Specifically, multi-stable/shape-reconfigurable tubes and cylinders are
   designed using the 3D configurations. Besides, one of the 3D
   metamaterials is developed for functional applications as shock absorber
   and damper, i.e., the process from fully stretched state to fully
   compacted state is used to absorb energy and reduce incoming pressure
   with small stiffness and strength; then the fully compacted
   metamaterials are used to carry load and attenuate vibration with
   relative bigger stiffness and strength. This work gives advance to the
   design, analysis and manufacture of functionally reconfigurable
   mechanical metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Study Objectives: (1) To describe the incidence rate of motor vehicle
   crashes (MVCs) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); and (2)
   to investigate MVC risk factors in OSA patients.
   Methods: A retrospective case-series observational study was conducted
   using data from the West Australian Sleep Health Study at a tertiary
   hospital-based sleep clinic. Participants were patients (N = 2,673)
   referred for assessment of suspected sleep disordered breathing.
   Questionnaire data were collected including age, sex, years of driving,
   near-misses and MVCs, sleepiness, and consumption of alcohol and
   caffeinated drinks. Overnight laboratory-based polysomnography was
   performed using standard methodology. 1 Poisson univariate and negative
   binomial multivariable regression models were used to investigate
   associations between risk factors and MVC and nearmiss risk in patients
   with untreated OSA.
   Results: In patients with untreated OSA, the crash rate was 0.06
   MVC/person-year compared with the general community crash rate of 0.02
   MVC/person-year. The rate ratio comparing very sleepy men with normal
   men was 4.68 (95\% CI 3.07, 7.14) for near-misses and 1.27 (95\% CI
   1.00, 1.61) for crashes, after adjusting for confounders. In women there
   was a significant association with sleepiness score (p = 0.02) but no
   dose effect across quartiles.
   Conclusions: Untreated OSA is associated with an increased risk of
   near-misses in men and women and an increased risk of MVCs in very
   sleepy men. There is a strong association between excessive daytime
   sleepiness and increased report of near-misses. Our data support the
   observation that it is those patients with increased sleepiness
   regardless of OSA severity who are most at risk.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo identify empirical model-based patterns of multimorbidity
   from chronic noncommunicable diseases in the general population, with a
   focus on the contribution of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases
   (RMDs), and to quantify their association with adverse health outcomes.
   MethodsCross-sectional data from the Portuguese Fourth National Health
   Survey were analyzed (n=23,754). Latent class analysis was used to
   identify patterns of coexistence of 11 chronic noncommunicable diseases
   (RMDs, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease, stroke, depression, myocardial infarction, cancer,
   osteoporosis, asthma, and renal failure). Based on the Outcome Measures
   in Rheumatology, filter 2.0, health outcomes included life impact,
   pathophysiologic manifestations, and resource use. We assessed the
   association between patterns and adverse health outcomes, through sex-,
   age-, and body mass index-adjusted prevalence ratios with 95\%
   confidence intervals, obtained using Poisson regression.
   ResultsFour patterns of chronic noncommunicable diseases co-occurrence
   were identified and labeled as low disease probability, cardiometabolic
   conditions, respiratory conditions, and RMDs and depression. RMDs were
   highly prevalent in patients with chronic diseases (from 38.6\% in
   cardiometabolic conditions to 66.7\% in RMDs and depression). While
   negative self-rated health, short-term disability, and chronic pain were
   more strongly associated with cardiometabolic conditions and respiratory
   conditions, all multimorbidity patterns were similarly associated with
   long-term disability, frequent health care utilization, and
   out-of-pocket health care expenses.
   ConclusionOur study emphasizes RMDs as a major presence in
   multimorbidity in the general population. All multimorbidity patterns
   were associated with a wide set of adverse health outcomes. Management
   strategies for the patient with chronic cardiometabolic, respiratory, or
   depressive conditions should also target RMDs.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There are limited empirical data on the prevalence and
   incidence of orphanhood due to parental HIV infection.
   Objective: To assess the prevalence and incidence of orphanhood, and the
   population attributable fraction (PAF) of incident orphanhood associated
   with parental HIV infection, in a rural population with a 14.8\% adult
   HIV prevalence.
   Methods: The data are derived from a community cohort in Rakai District,
   Uganda. Census data were collected on all resident members in 10 657
   households, including survival of parents of resident children in
   1996/1997. Consenting adults were interviewed, provided blood for HIV
   testing, and were followed up 10 months later to determine parental
   death and incident orphanhood. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of
   orphanhood associated with parental HIV-infection was estimated by
   Poisson multivariate regression.
   Results: A total of 22 712 children aged 0-14 years were enumerated in
   1996/1997. The overall prevalence of orphanhood was higher among
   children of HIV-infected parents (22.7\%) compared with children of
   uninfected parents, 7.9\%. The annual incidence of orphanhood was 8.2\%
   if at least one parent was HIV positive, and 0.5\% if both parents were
   HIV negative (adjusted IRR = 18.93). Older age of children, and older
   maternal age were significantly associated with an increased risk of
   orphanhood. The PAF of incident orphanhood due to parental HIV infection
   was 37.3\%, and was highest among younger children (adjusted PAF =
   50.6\% for 0-4 year olds), and children with younger mothers aged < 25
   years (adjusted PAF = 75.7\%).
   Conclusions: Parental HIV infection markedly increased the incidence of
   orphanhood, especially among younger children and the children of
   younger mothers. (c) 2005 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins}},

Abstract = {{Background. Little is known about the impact of psychosocial factors and
   substance use on viral suppression among human immunodeficiency virus
   (HIV)-infected key populations in resource-limited settings.
   Accordingly, we examined the association and interactions between
   depression, alcohol use, and recreational drug use on viral suppression
   among men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs (PWID)
   in India.
   Methods. MSM and PWID were recruited across India using
   respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Correlates of viral suppression were
   determined using Poisson regression models incorporating RDS-II weights.
   Two-way multiplicative interactions were assessed with separate models
   of all combinations of the 3 variables of interest using interaction
   terms; 3-way interactions were evaluated by stratifying 2-way
   interactions by the third variable.
   Results. Among 1454 treatment-eligible HIV-infected MSM and 1939 PWID,
   older age (adjusted prevalence ratio {[}aPR], 1.14 for MSM; 1.41 for
   PWID) and higher HIV treatment literacy (aPR, 1.58 for MSM; 3.04 for
   PWID) were positively associated with viral suppression. Among MSM,
   there was evidence of a synergistic negative association between severe
   depression and recreational drug use (aPR, 0.37 {[}95\% confidence
   interval \{CI\}, .16-.84]), alcohol dependence and recreational drug use
   (aPR, 0.45 {[}95\% CI, .20-.99]), and severe depression, alcohol
   dependence, and recreational drug use (aPR, 0.23 {[}95\% CI, .09-.57]).
   Among PWID, daily injection (aPR, 0.51 {[}95\% CI, .31-.82]) was the
   primary barrier to suppression.
   Conclusions. Incorporating psychosocial and harm-reduction services into
   differentiated care models targeting MSM and PWID in low-resource
   settings is critical to achieving the 90-90-90 HIV/AIDS targets.}},

Title = {{Time trends in health inequalities due to care in the context of the
   Spanish Dependency Law}},
Journal = {{GACETA SANITARIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{11-17}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objective: In Spain, responsibility for care of old people and those in
   situations of dependency is assumed by families, and has an unequal
   social distribution according to gender and socioeconomic level. This
   responsibility has negative health effects on the carer. In 2006, the
   Dependency Law recognised the obligation of the State to provide
   support. This study analyses time trends in health inequalities
   attributable to caregiving under this new law.
   Methods: Study of trends using two cross-sectional samples from the 2006
   and 2012 editions of the Spanish National Health Survey (27,922 and
   19,995 people, respectively). We compared fair/poor self rated health,
   poor mental health (GHQ-12 >2), back pain, and the use of psychotropic
   drugs between non-carers, carers sharing care with other persons, and
   those providing care alone. We obtain prevalence ratios by fitting
   robust Poisson regression models.
   Results: We observed no change in the social profile of carers according
   to gender or social class. Among women, the difference in all health
   indicators between carers and non-carers tended to decrease among those
   sharing care but not among lone carers. Inequalities tend to decrease
   slightly in both groups of men carers.
   Conclusions: Between 2006 and 2012, trends in health inequalities
   attributable to informal care show different trends according to gender
   and share of responsibility. It is necessary to redesign and implement
   policies to reduce inequalities that take into account the most affected
   groups, such as women lone carers. Policies that strengthen the fair
   social distribution of care should also be adopted. (C) 2016 SESPAS.

Abstract = {{Background: We investigated the prevalence and protective value of
   serosorting {[}ie, establishing HIV concordance in advance to practice
   unprotected anal intercourse (UAI)] with casual partners (CP) among
   HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) using longitudinal data
   from 2007 to 2011. Methods: Men of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies were
   tested biannually for HIV-1 antibodies and filled in questionnaires
   about sexual behavior in the preceding 6 months. HIV incidence was
   examined among men who practiced UAI, UAI with serosorting, or
   consistent condom use, using Poisson regression. Results: Of 445 MSM
   with CPs, 31 seroconverted for HIV during a total follow-up of 1107
   person-years. Overall observed HIV incidence rate was 2.8/100
   person-years. Consistent condom use was reported in 64\%, UAI in 25\%,
   and UAI with serosorting in 11\% of the 2137 follow-up visits. MSM who
   practiced serosorting were less likely to seroconvert {[}adjusted
   incidence rate ratio (aIRR) = 0.46; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.13
   to 1.59] than MSM who had UAI, but more likely to seroconvert than MSM
   who consistently used condoms (aIRR = 1.32; 95\% CI: 0.37 to 4.62),
   although differences in both directions were not statistically
   significant. MSM who consistently used condoms were less likely to
   seroconvert than MSM who had UAI (aIRR = 0.37; 95\% CI: 0.18 to 0.77).
   Discussion: The protective effect for serosorting we found was not
   statistically significant. Consistent condom use was found to be most
   protective against HIV infection. Larger studies are needed to
   demonstrate whether serosorting with CPs offers sufficient protection
   against HIV infection, and if not, why it fails to do so.}},

Title = {{Medication use in normal weight and overweight children in a nationally

Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{842-847}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background As overweight and obese children are more likely to develop
   serious medical conditions, they incur higher doctor and hospital costs
   compared to their normal weight counterparts. Consequently, the
   differential healthcare costs between obese and normal weight children
   may be even greater if medication use is considered.
   Objective To compare medication use between normal weight and overweight
   children in a nationally representative sample from Canada.
   Methods Data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey 2007/2009, a
   cross-sectional survey assessing indicators of health and wellness in
   Canadians, was used in the current study. The analysis included 2087
   children and adolescents between 6-19 years of age with valid measures
   of body mass index (BMI). Poisson/negative binomial regression was used
   to examine the association between weight status and the number of
   medications taken in the last month.
   Result For 6-11 year olds, the frequency of prescription,
   over-the-counter and natural health product (NHP) medication use did not
   differ between normal weight and overweight/obese children. For 12-19
   year olds, overweight/obese children used prescription medication
   significantly more often than their normal weight peers (adjusted
   incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.59; 95\% CI 1.19 to 2.14), whereas for NHP
   the opposite was the case (adjusted IRR, 0.52; 95\% CI 0.32 to 0.82).
   These children also used nervous system and respiratory medications more
   frequently than their normal weight peers.
   Conclusion The findings of the present study suggest that the
   differential usage of prescription drugs among overweight/obese children
   underline the need to develop effective obesity prevention programmes
   and policies that may reduce the health and economic burden of childhood
   obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aims The literature is scarce on the association between
   traumatic dental injuries (TDI) and oral health-related quality of life
   (OHRQoL) among adolescents, and there is no study assessing this
   relationship using clinical criteria for the assessment of TDI in this
   age group. The aim of this study was to assess the association between
   TDI and OHRQoL among 15 to 19yearold adolescents from Santa Maria,
   Brazil. Materials and Methods A population-based cross-sectional study
   was conducted including a representative sample of 1197 15 to 19yearold
   adolescents attending 31 public and private schools. The Oral Health
   Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) was used to evaluate the OHRQoL, and
   clinical examinations were performed to diagnose TDI based on the
   O'Brien classification. Demographic information, socioeconomic status,
   and clinical characteristics (caries experience, malocclusion, and
   gingivitis) were also collected as adjusting variables. Multilevel
   Poisson regression models were used to assess the association between
   TDI and OHRQoL. Rate ratios (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI)
   were estimated. Results The overall prevalence of TDI was 17\%, mild
   trauma was 12\%, and severe trauma was 5\%. In the adjusted models,
   adolescents with TDI had poorer OHRQoL than those without TDI (RR =
   1.10; 95\% CI = 1.05-1.16). This negative effect was related to the
   psychological disability domain (RR = 1.16; 95\% CI = 1.02-1.32), to the
   social disability domain (RR = 1.34; 95\% CI = 1.13-1.59), and to the
   handicap domain (RR = 1.35; 95\% CI = 1.10-1.66). Conclusions Despite
   its low severity, TDI negatively affected the OHRQoL of 15 to 19yearold
   adolescents from Santa Maria, Brazil.}},

Title = {{Wave propagation in microtubule-based bio-nano-architected networks: A
   lesson from nature}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{164}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Microtubules, bio-polymeric hollow tubes forming entangled radial
   networks from the nucleus to the cell membrane, are considered the main
   part of the cytoskeleton providing mechanical stiffness, organization
   and shape for the cytoplasm of the eukaryotic cells and playing
   substantial roles in some cellular processes such as
   mechanotransduction, cell division, intercellular transports, internal
   organization of the cell components, etc. In all of the mentioned
   functions, the network structure of the microtubules has the main
   responsibility proving the importance of more in-depth studies of their
   mechanical properties. This paper addresses the elastic wave propagation
   in various two-dimensional microtubule-based bio-nano-architected
   periodic networks to analyze their dynamic characteristics for possible
   further utilizations. The study starts with selecting a proper beam
   model for a single microtubule, as proved by previous experiments, and
   continues with creating ten widely used periodic structures, namely
   square, triangle, triangle-square, triangle-diamond, negative Poisson's
   ratio, semi-honeycomb, star-honeycomb, zig-zag, hexagram, and Sierpinski
   triangle, thereof. To obtain the dispersion curves, finite element
   models are developed for both individual and networked microtubules, and
   the phononic band structures are calculated based on Bloch's theorem.
   The results reveal the possibility of designing bandgaps in specific
   ranges for the low- and high-frequency bio-filter applications depending
   on the topologies of the selected unit cells as well as the considered
   periodicities. This application helps researchers control the ways to
   absorb some unwanted or hazardous vibrations using architected periodic
   structures and, thanks to the higher biocompatibility resulted from
   their biomaterial origin, the networks can be applied in next-generation
   nano-biomechanical instruments such as implantable biosensors.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has the potential to be an empowering
   HIV prevention tool among female sex workers (FSW), yet little is known
   about PrEP awareness and interest in this population. Sex workers and
   Police Promoting Health in Risky Environments (SAPPHIRE) is a
   prospective cohort study of street-based FSW in Baltimore, MD. A
   cross-sectional analysis explored awareness and interest in PrEP among
   HIV-negative FSW. Multivariable Poisson regressions modeled associations
   between individual, interpersonal, and structural variables and PrEP
   awareness and interest. Of n = 232 FSW, 66\% were white, half were less
   than 35 years old, 59\% injected drugs daily, and 66\% sold sex daily.
   Only 21\% of FSW were aware of PrEP, though 74\% were interested. PrEP
   awareness was associated with experiencing client condom coercion
   {[}adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) = 0.50, 95\% CI: 0.28-0.90] and
   condomless sex with an intimate partner (aIRR = 0.54, 95\% CI:
   0.30-0.98). PrEP interest was associated with perceiving PrEP as ``very
   easy{''} to take (aIRR = 1.91, 95\% CI: 1.49-2.45) and moving to an
   unfamiliar geographic area to sell sex (aIRR = 1.20, 95\% CI:
   1.04-1.39). Women who had a current gonorrhea or chlamydia infection
   were less likely to be interested in PrEP (aIRR = 0.75, 95\% CI:
   0.59-0.95). Though PrEP awareness among FSW is low, there are FSW who
   are significantly more likely to express interest in PrEP and outreach
   efforts should target these women. Results suggest that women-controlled
   HIV prevention methods may be important for reducing incidence among
   FSW.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives This study examines the prevalence of pregnancy in
   serodiscordant couples and identifies predictors associated with
   pregnancy in rural Rakai, Uganda.
   Study design A population-based cross-sectional study that used data
   from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS).
   Setting and participants We used data from the RCCS survey round 17
   (2015-2016), which included 488 women in serodiscordant relationships.
   This study was conducted in Rakai district, located in south-western
   Uganda.
   Primary outcomes Pregnancy status.
   Statistical analysis Multivariable modified Poisson regression using
   stepwise selection was used to determine characteristics and behaviours
   associated with pregnancy status.
   Results The prevalence of pregnancy was 12\% in women among
   serodiscordant couples. HIV-negative women in serodiscordant couples had
   a slightly higher pregnancy prevalence rate (13.6\%) compared with
   HIV-positive women in serodiscordant couples (11\%). Factors
   significantly associated with higher prevalence of pregnancy were;
   younger age 15-24 years (prevalence risk ratio (PRR)=4.04; 95\% CI 1.72
   to 9.50), middle age 25-34 years (PRR=2.49; 95\% CI 1.05 to 5.89),
   Christian religion (PRR=2.26; 95\% CI 1.41 to 3.63) and inconsistent
   condom use in the last 12 months (PRR=4.38, 95\% CI 1.09 to 17.53).
   Neither HIV status nor HIV status disclosure was significantly
   associated with risk of getting pregnant.
   Conclusion Nearly 12\% of women in serodiscordant relationships were
   pregnant, highlighting the need for integrated services to prevent
   unintended pregnancies and reduce conceptional related risks for those
   choosing to conceive. Association with younger age and inconsistent
   condom use suggests a role for early and continued couple-based
   conception counselling.}},

Title = {{Cohort study of occupational cosmic radiation dose and cancer mortality
   in German aircrew, 1960-2014}},
Journal = {{OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{77}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   To determine cancer mortality compared with the general population and
   to examine dose-response relationships between cumulative occupational
   radiation dose and specific cancer outcomes in the German aircrew
   cohort.
   Methods
   For a cohort of 26 846 aircrew personnel, standardised mortality ratios
   (SMR) were calculated. Dose-response analyses were carried out using
   Poisson regression to assess dose-related cancer risks for the period
   1960-2014. Exposure assessment comprises recently available dose
   register data for all cohort members and newly estimated retrospective
   cabin crew doses for 1960-2003.
   Results
   SMR for all-cause, specific cancer groups and most individual cancers
   were reduced in all aircrew groups. The only increases were seen for
   brain cancer in pilots (n=23, SMR 2.01, 95\% CI 1.15 to 3.28) and for
   malignant melanoma (n=10, SMR 1.88, 95\% CI 0.78 to 3.85). Breast cancer
   mortality among female cabin crew was similar to the general population
   (n=71, SMR 1.06, 95\% CI 0.77 to 1.44). Overall median cumulative
   effective dose was 34.2 mSv (max: 116 mSv) for 1960-2014. No
   dose-response associations were seen in any of the models. For brain
   cancer, relative risks were elevated across dose categories. An
   indicative negative trend with increasing dose category was seen for
   large intestine cancer in female cabin crew (n=23).
   Conclusions
   There was no evidence for significant dose-response patterns for the
   considered cancer types. Interpretation of results remains difficult as
   cumulative dose is closely related to age. Future work should focus on
   investigating radiation jointly with other risk factors that may
   contribute to risks for specific cancers among aircrew.}},

Abstract = {{Crustal extension in graben takes place by normal (+strike-slip)
   faulting, yet the physical processes involved are poorly understood. A
   series of shallow large earthquakes struck the Kumamoto area of Kyushu,
   Japan, in 2016. The M(w)7.0 main shock was a slip along the southern
   boundary of the Beppu-Shimabara Graben, where NS-extensional crustal
   deformation is now taking place. We conducted a tomographic inversion
   for crustal P and S velocities and Poisson's ratio (V-p, V-s, and sigma)
   in Kyushu. The most outstanding feature in this region is a
   Beppu-Shimabara Graben-parallel belt of low V-p and V-s anomalies at
   depths of the upper crust. We find that within the belt dV(s)/V-s
   approximate to dV(p)/V-p (<0) in marked contrast to relations in other
   low-velocity regions where |dV(s)/V-s|>|dV(p)/V-p|. This observation can
   be interpreted as due to water-saturated, oblate-spheroid pores with
   either of two very different geometries: one almost round pore and the
   other very flat pore. We calculate 3-D density anomaly distributions and
   2-D gravity anomaly profiles for these two pore models. The gravity
   anomaly map calculated for spherical pores shows a significant negative
   anomaly belt that spatially agrees with observed Bouguer anomaly map.
   The spatial agreement is very poor if pores are modeled as flat. This
   and extensive seismicity within Beppu-Shimabara Graben imply
   significance of fault-associated round pore formation in the process of
   graben opening. Seismic tomography combined with gravity and
   poroeasticty analyses can constrain the crack/pore state of
   extensionally deforming crust.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Suicide is higher among economically inactive and unemployed
   persons than employed persons. This paper investigates differences in
   this relationship by sex and age over the period 2001 to 2010 in
   Australia. It also examines changes in suicide among employed,
   unemployed and economically inactive persons during the recession of
   2007-09.
   Method: Suicide data from the National Coroners Information System were
   utilised for this retrospective study. Negative binomial and Poisson
   regression was used to estimate the association between suicide and
   employment status and to investigate differences in suicide rates over
   the period of the recession (2007-09) compared with the year before the
   recession (2006).
   Results: Results suggest that during 2001-10 economically
   inactive/unemployed males had a suicide rate ratio (RR) of 4.62 {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 4.10, 5.19; P<0.001] compared with employed
   males (RR=1.00), whereas economically inactive/unemployed females had a
   suicide RR of 8.44 compared with employed females (95\% CI 7.38, 9.67;
   P<0.001). There was an increase in suicide among both employed (7\% rise
   in 2007, P=0.003) and economically inactive/unemployed males during the
   GFC (22\% in 2008, P<0.001). Suicide also increased among economically
   inactive/unemployed females (12\% in 2007, P=0.03; 19\% in 2008,
   P=0.001) but not among employed females.
   Conclusions: These results suggest the need for adequate policy and
   social welfare responses to ameliorate the effects of the economic
   recession on the working age population. Particularly, these should
   target unemployed and economically inactive men and women in Australia,
   who may be at higher risk of suicide than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Methods. We characterized trends in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
   and HCV infection incidence and HCV infection prevalence among injection
   drug users (IDUs) recruited over 4 periods: 1988-1989, 1994-1995, 1998,
   and 2005-2008. We calculated HIV and HCV infection incidence within the
   first year of follow-up among IDUs whose test results were negative for
   these viruses at baseline (n = 2061 and n = 373, respectively). We used
   Poisson regression to compare trends across groups.
   Results. HIV infection incidence declined significantly from 5.5
   cases/100 person-years (py) in the 1988-1989 group to 2.0 cases/100 py
   in the 1994-1995 group to 0 cases/100 py in the 1998 and 2005-2008
   groups. Concurrently, HCV infection incidence declined but remained
   robust (22.0 cases/100 py in the 1988-1989 cohort to 17.2 cases/100 py
   in the 1994-1995 cohort, 17.9 cases/100 py in the 1998 cohort, and 7.8
   cases/100 py in the 2005-2008 cohort; P = .07). Likewise, HCV infection
   prevalence declined, but chiefly in younger IDUs. For persons aged < 39
   years, relative to the 1988-1989 cohort, all groups exhibited
   significant declines (adjusted prevalence ratio {[}PR] for the 2005-08
   cohort, .73; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], .65-.81). However, for
   persons aged >= 39 years, only the 2005-2008 cohort exhibited declining
   prevalence compared with the 1988-1989 cohort (adjusted PR, .87; 95\%
   CI, .77-.99).
   Conclusions. Although efforts to reduce blood-borne infection incidence
   have had impact, this work will need to be intensified for the most
   transmissible viruses, such as HCV.}},

Abstract = {{Some studies reported an increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS)
   within six weeks of influenza vaccination. It has also been suggested
   that this finding could have been confounded by influenza illnesses. We
   explored the complex relationship between influenza illness, influenza
   vaccination, and GBS, from an ecologic perspective using nationally
   representative data. We also studied seasonal patterns for GBS
   hospitalizations.
   Monthly hospitalization data (2000-2009) for GBS, and pneumonia and
   influenza (P\&I) in the Nation-wide Inpatient Sample were included.
   Seasonal influenza vaccination coverage for 2004-2005 through the
   2008-2009 influenza seasons (August-May) was estimated from the National
   Health Interview Survey data. GBS seasonality was determined using
   Poisson regression. GBS and P\&I temporal clusters were identified using
   scan statistics. The association between P\&I and CBS hospitalizations
   in the same month (concurrent) or in the following month (lagged) were
   determined using negative binomial regression.
   Vaccine coverage increased over the years (from 19.7\% during 2004-2005
   to 35.5\% during 2008-2009 season) but GBS hospitalization did not
   follow a similar pattern. Overall, a significant correlation between
   monthly P\&I and GBS hospitalizations was observed (Spearman's
   correlation coefficient=0.7016, p < 0.0001). A significant (p = 0.001)
   cluster of P\&I hospitalizations during December 2004-March 2005
   overlapped a significant (p = 0.001) cluster of GBS hospitalizations
   during January 2005-February 2005. After accounting for effects of
   monthly vaccine coverage and age, P\&I hospitalization was significantly
   associated (p < 0.0001) with GBS hospitalization in the concurrent month
   but not with GBS hospitalization in the following month. Monthly vaccine
   coverage was not associated with GBS hospitalization in adjusted models
   (both concurrent and lagged). CBS hospitalizations demonstrated a
   seasonal pattern with winter months having higher rates compared to the
   month of June.
   P\&I hospitalization rates were significantly correlated with
   hospitalization rates for GBS. Vaccine coverage did not significantly
   affect the rates of GBS hospitalization at the population level.

Abstract = {{Background Better understanding of the dynamics and temporal changes in
   manual therapy service utilisation may assist with healthcare planning
   and resource allocation. The objectives of this study were to quantify,
   describe, and compare service utilisation trends in the manual therapy
   professions within the Australian private healthcare setting between
   2008 and 2017. Methods Data regarding the number of services, total
   cost, and benefits paid were extracted for each manual therapy
   profession (i.e. chiropractic, osteopathy, and physiotherapy) for the
   period 2008-2017 from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.
   The number of registered providers for each profession were obtained
   from the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. Descriptive
   statistics were produced for two time periods (i.e. 2008-2012 and
   2013-2017) for each manual therapy profession. Annual percentage change
   during each time period was estimated by fitting Poisson regression
   models. Test for the equality of regression coefficients was used to
   compare the trends in the two time periods within each profession, and
   to compare the trends across professions within a time period. Results A
   cumulative total of 198.6 million manual therapy services with a total
   cost of \$12.8 billion was provided within the Australian private
   healthcare setting between 2008 and 2017. Although service utilisation
   and total cost increased throughout the ten-year period, the annual
   growth was significantly lower during 2013-2017 than 2008-2012. Whereas
   osteopathy and physiotherapy experienced significant annual growth in
   the number of services and total cost during 2013-2017, negative growth
   in the number of services was observed for chiropractic during the same
   period. The annual number of services per provider declined
   significantly for chiropractic and physiotherapy between 2013 and 2017.
   Conclusion Service provision under private health insurance general
   treatment cover constitute a major source of revenue for manual therapy
   professions in Australia. Although manual therapy service utilisation
   increased throughout the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017, the annual
   growth declined. There were diverging trends across the three
   professions, including significantly greater decline in annual growth
   for chiropractic than for osteopathy and physiotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Nine years after the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate
   vaccine (PCV) in the United States, Hong Kong (HK) introduced the
   vaccine to its universal childhood immunisation programme in 2009. We
   aimed to assess the impact of childhood PCV immunisation on all-cause
   pneumonia (ACP) admissions among the overall population of HK.
   Methods: In this population-based interrupted time series analysis, we
   used territory-wide population representative electronic health records
   in HK to evaluate the vaccine impact. We identified hospitalised
   patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia from any cause between 2004 and
   2017. We applied segmented Poisson regression to assess the gradual
   change in the monthly incidence of ACP admissions between pre and
   post-vaccination periods. Negative outcome control, subgroup and
   sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of the main
   analysis.
   Findings: Over the 14-year study period, a total of 587,607 ACP episodes
   were identified among 357,950 patients. The monthly age-standardised
   incidence of ACP fluctuated between 33.42 and 87.44 per 100,000-persons.
   There was a marginal decreasing trend in pneumonia admissions after PCV
   introduction among overall population (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR]:
   0.9965, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.9932-0.99 98), and older
   adults (>= 65 years, IRR: 0.9928, 95\% CI: 0.9904-0.9953) but not in
   younger age groups.
   Interpretation: There was a marginally declining trend of overall ACP
   admissions in HK up to eight years after childhood PCV introduction. The
   significance disappeared when fitting sensitivity analyses. The results
   indicate the complexities of using non-specific endpoints for measuring
   vaccine effect and the necessity of enhancing serotype surveillance
   systems for replacement monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their compatibility in the well-developed Si-based semiconductor
   industry, exploring two-dimensional (2D) silicon crystals with both
   sizable band gaps and high carrier mobility is important to develop
   high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices on the nanoscale.
   Here, eleven new 2D silicon crystals are reported based on the strategy
   of mixing 3-fold and 4-fold coordinated silicon atoms in 2D confined
   phases and first-principles calculations. We establish that these 2D
   silicon crystals can be obtained by functionalizing silicene with
   silicon atoms, dimers, or chains, which exhibit lower formation energy
   than that of silicene. Their dynamic stability and thermal stability are
   confirmed by phonon calculations and Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamic
   simulation at temperatures up to 700 K. Electronic structure
   calculations reveal that these 2D silicon crystals are semiconductors
   with sizable and tunable band gaps, ranging from 1.12 to 1.67 eV, and
   four of them are direct or quasi-direct band gap semiconductors with
   strong absorption in the visible-light frequency. The calculated Young's
   stiffness of 2D silicon crystals ranges from 31 to 88 N m(-1), which are
   comparable to phosphorene, but remarkably smaller than those of MoS2
   monolayer and graphene. Remarkably, C-z-P2/c-Si-12 possesses a negative
   Poisson's ratio with a maximum value of -0.055. In particular, 2D
   silicon crystals possess ultrahigh carrier mobility of up to 1.7 x 10(5)
   and 1.3 x 10(4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at room temperature for electrons and
   holes, respectively, suitable for high-speed electronic and
   optoelectronic applications on the nanoscale.}},

Abstract = {{Objective We aimed to evaluate residence in evacuation areas (storm
   areas) as a risk factor for food and waterborne disease (FWBD)
   associated with Hurricane Sandy flooding.
   Methods We captured 9601 incident outpatient and inpatient FWBD hospital
   discharge diagnoses for residents of the greater New York City area. We
   used Poisson or negative binomial regression models to compare the
   covariate-adjusted risk for a FWBD diagnosis, pre-Sandy (10/28-11/09,
   2001-2011) vs. post-Sandy (10/28-11/09, 2012), for residents of storm
   and non-storm areas.
   Results Outpatient FWBD risk was lower for storm area residents after
   Hurricane Sandy (risk ratio {[}RR]=0.58, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 0.46-0.74), and varied by age, sex, and county. However, storm
   area residents 65 years of age or older experienced higher risk after
   Hurricane Sandy (RR=2.16, 95\% CI: 1.11-4.19), albeit based on few
   cases. Inpatient FWBD risk was lower for non-storm area residents after
   Hurricane Sandy (RR=0.79, 95\% CI: 0.66-0.95), and varied by age, race,
   and county, although there was no significant change for storm area
   residents (RR=0.86, 95\% CI: 0.69-1.08). Those 65 years of age were also
   at lower risk for inpatient FWBD diagnosis, yet the effect was weaker
   for storm area (RR=0.89, 95\% CI: 0.67-1.18) than for non-storm area
   residents (RR=0.68, 95\% CI: 0.52-0.89).
   Conclusions Hurricane preparation, mitigation, and response activities
   in the greater New York City area may have led to protective effects for

Abstract = {{Background: Time-series analyses have been used for decades to
   investigate time-varying environmental exposures. Recently, the
   case-crossover design has been applied to assess acute effects of air
   pollution. Our objective was to compare time-series and case-crossover
   analyses using varying referent periods (ie, unidirectional,
   ambidirectional, and time-stratified).
   Methods: We examined the association between temperature and
   cardiorespiratory mortality among the elderly population in the 20
   largest metropolitan areas of the United States. Risks were estimated by
   season and geographic region in 1992. We obtained weather data from the
   National Climatic Data Center and mortality data from the Division of
   Vital Statistics. Conditional logistic regression (case-crossover) and
   Poisson regression (time-series) were used to estimate the increased
   risk of cardiorespiratory mortality associated with a 10degreesF
   increase in daily temperature, accounting for dew-point temperature and
   other potential confounding factors.
   Results: In the time-stratified case-crossover analysis, the strongest
   associations were found in the summer; in the Southwest, Southeast,
   Northwest, Northeast, and Midwest, the odds ratios were 1.15 (95\%
   confidence interval = 1.07-1.24), 1.10 (0.96-1.27), 1.08 (0.92-1.26),
   1.08 (1.02-1.15), and 1.01 (0.92-1.11), respectively. Mostly null or
   negative associations were found in the winter, spring, and fall. The
   ambidirectional case-crossover and the time-series analyses produced
   quantitatively similar results to those from the time-stratified
   analysis. The unidirectional analysis produced conflicting results.
   Conclusions: Inferences from studies of weather and mortality using the
   ambidirectional or time-stratified case-crossover approaches and the
   time-series analyses are comparable and provide consistent findings in
   this study.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We assessed prevalence of suicidal ideation and plans among
   illicit drug users and their association with contextual factors, by
   gender.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study. In a sample of 511 illicit drug users
   recruited during spring 2012 in drug treatment and prevention facilities
   in Catalonia (Spain), the prevalence of suicidal ideation/plans in the
   last 12 months was assessed. Poisson regression was used to examine
   associations between suicidal ideation/plans and various factors
   (socio-demographic, psychological, illegal drug market activities and
   marginal income generation activities, which included any reported sex
   work, stealing, peddling, begging or borrowing on credit from a dealer).
   Results: The average age was 37.9 years (standard deviation: 8.62);
   76.3\% were men. Suicidal ideation/plans were reported by 30.8\% of men
   and 38.8\% of women, with no significant differences by age or gender.
   Recent aggression (male prevalence ratio {[}PR] = 2.2; female PR= 1.4),
   psychological treatment (male PR= 1.2; female PR= 1.3) and
   illegal/marginal income generation activities (male PR= 1.5; female PR =
   1.1) were associated with suicidal ideation/plans. Men who trafficked
   were more likely to have suicidal ideation/plans (PR= 1.3), while prison
   history was positive for women (PR= 1.8) and negative for men (PR= 0.7).
   Conclusions: Prevalence of suicidal ideation/plans was high among
   illicit drug users recruited from healthcare facilities. Besides
   psychological variables, participation in illegal market activities and
   crime ought to be considered in drug users' suicidal prevention. Suicide
   risk needs to be evaluated in drug treatment facilities and
   psychological status and context contemplated. (C) 2017 SESPAS.

Abstract = {{In this paper analytical and finite element (FE) simulations are carried
   out to calculate the in-plane Poisson's ratio and Young's moduli of a
   new centresymmetric honeycomb configuration under uniaxial loading.
   Opposite to similar re-entrant honeycomb structures studied in the past,
   the new re-entrant unit cell topology takes into account possible
   manufacturing constraints typical of production routes like Resin
   Transfer Moulding (RTM) or Rapid Prototyping (RP). The results obtained
   through the analytical and FE analysis show a significant decrease of
   the Poisson's ratio for the internal cell angle between -20 degrees and
   +20 degrees compared to the classical re-entrant configurations
   exhibited in literature. The results also show that the presence of edge
   corners in the unit cell honeycomb configuration gives rise to a
   cellular structure with enhanced flexibility compared to the classical
   centresymmetric one. The results obtained by the analytical model show
   good agreement with the Gibson and Ashby rib-bending model when the
   honeycomb configuration reduces to the theoretical layout without
   modifications due to manufacturing constraints. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{The seed capsule of Delosperma nakurense is a remarkable example of a
   natural hygromorph, which unfolds its protecting valves upon wetting to
   expose its seeds. The beautiful mechanism responsible for this motion is
   generated by a specialized organ based on an anisotropic cellular tissue
   filled with a highly swelling material. Inspired by this system, we
   study the mechanics of a diamond honeycomb internally pressurized by a
   fluid phase. Numerical homogenization by means of iterative
   finite-element (FE) simulations is adapted to the case of cellular
   materials filled with a variable pressure fluid phase. Like its
   biological counterpart, it is shown that the material architecture
   controls and guides the otherwise unspecific isotropic expansion of the
   fluid. Deformations up to twice the original dimensions can be achieved
   by simply setting the value of input pressure. In turn, these
   deformations cause a marked change of the honeycomb geometry and hence
   promote a stiffening of the material along the weak direction. To
   understand the mechanism further, we also developed a micromechanical
   model based on the Born model for crystal elasticity to find an explicit
   relation between honeycomb geometry, swelling eigenstrains and elastic
   properties. The micromechanical model is in good qualitative agreement
   with the FE simulations. Moreover, we also provide the force-stroke
   characteristics of a soft actuator based on the pressurized anisotropic
   honeycomb and show how the internal pressure has a nonlinear effect
   which can result in negative values of the in-plane Poisson's ratio. As
   nature shows in the case of the D. nakurense seed capsule, cellular
   materials can be used not only as low-weight structural materials, but
   also as simple but convenient actuating materials.}},

Title = {{Relation between tobacco control policies and population at high risk of

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{179}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction Lung cancer accounts for nearly 2 million deaths per year
   worldwide, the majority of cases due to smoking as the main risk factor
   associated. The aim of this study was to assess the relation between the
   level of implementation of tobacco control policies and the population
   at high risk of lung cancer in the European Union (EU).
   Methods: The Special Eurobarometer 458 ``Attitudes of Europeans towards
   tobacco and electronic cigarettes{''}, conducted in 2017, and the
   Tobacco Control Scale (TCS) 2010, 2013, and 2016 were the sources of our
   data. High risk of lung cancer was defined by the inclusion criteria in
   the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and the Dutch-Belgian Lung
   Cancer Screening Trial (NELSON), the largest lung cancer screening
   trials carried out in the US and the EU. We calculated Spearman's rank
   correlation coefficients (r(sp)) and fitted multilevel generalized
   linear mixed models using the quasi-Poisson family to assess the
   correlation at the national level and analyze the association at the
   individual level, respectively, between the scores in the TCS (higher
   scores means better implementation of tobacco control policies) and the
   proportion of individuals at high risk of lung cancer in member states
   of the EU.
   Results: The scores in the TCS 2010 were statistically negatively
   correlated with the current proportion of ever and former smokers at
   high risk according to NELSON criteria ( - 0.41; 95\%CI -0.68, -0.04 and
   - 0.49; 95\%CI -0.73, -0.13, respectively). We observed statistically
   significant inverse associations between the scores in the TCS 2010 for
   the highest quartiles and the proportion of individuals at high risk of
   lung cancer according to both criteria. Non-statistically significant
   negative correlations and inverse associations were observed with other
   TCS.
   Conclusion: There is a lag between the implementation of tobacco control
   policies and the reduction of the rates of high risk of lung cancer.
   Member states should reinforce comprehensive tobacco control policies to
   reduce the population at high risk of lung cancer in the EU.}},

Title = {{High-risk human papillomavirus status and prognosis in invasive cervical
   cancer: A nationwide cohort study}},
Journal = {{PLOS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background
   High-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection is established as the
   major cause of invasive cervical cancer (ICC). However, whether hrHPV
   status in the tumor is associated with subsequent prognosis of ICC is
   controversial. We aim to evaluate the association between tumor hrHPV
   status and ICC prognosis using national registers and comprehensive
   human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping.
   Methods and findings
   In this nationwide population-based cohort study, we identified all ICC
   diagnosed in Sweden during the years 2002-2011 (4,254 confirmed cases),
   requested all archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks, and
   performed HPV genotyping. Twenty out of 25 pathology bio-banks agreed to
   the study, yielding a total of 2,845 confirmed cases with valid HPV
   results. Cases were prospectively followed up from date of cancer
   diagnosis to 31 December 2015, migration from Sweden, or death,
   whichever occurred first. The main exposure was tumor hrHPV status
   classified as hrHPV-positive and hrHPV-negative. The primary outcome was
   all-cause mortality by 31 December 2015. Five-year relative survival
   ratios (RSRs) were calculated, and excess hazard ratios (EHRs) with 95\%
   confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Poisson regression,
   adjusting for education, time since cancer diagnosis, and clinical
   factors including age at cancer diagnosis and International Federation
   of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage. Of the 2,845 included cases,
   hrHPV was detected in 2,293 (80.6\%), and we observed 1,131 (39.8\%)
   deaths during an average of 6.2 years follow-up. The majority of ICC
   cases were diagnosed at age 30-59 years (57.5\%) and classified as stage
   IB (40.7\%). hrHPV positivity was significantly associated with
   screen-detected tumors, young age, high education level, and early stage
   at diagnosis (p < 0.001). The 5-year RSR compared to the general female
   population was 0.74 (95\% CI 0.72-0.76) for hrHPV-positive cases and
   0.54 (95\% CI 0.50-0.59) for hrHPV-negative cases, yielding a crude EHR
   of 0.45 (95\% CI 0.38-0.52) and an adjusted EHR of 0.61 (95\% CI
   0.52-0.71). Risk of all-cause mortality as measured by EHR was
   consistently and statistically significantly lower for cases with
   hrHPV-positive tumors for each age group above 29 years and each FIGO
   stage above IA. The difference in prognosis by hrHPV status was highly
   robust, regardless of the clinical, histological, and educational
   characteristics of the cases. The main limitation was that, except for
   education, we were not able to adjust for lifestyle factors or other
   unmeasured confounders.
   Conclusions
   In this study, women with hrHPV-positive cervical tumors had a
   substantially better prognosis than women with hrHPV-negative tumors.
   hrHPV appears to be a biomarker for better prognosis in cervical cancer
   independent of age, FIGO stage, and histological type, extending
   information from already established prognostic factors. The underlying
   biological mechanisms relating lack of detectable tumor hrHPV to
   considerably worse prognosis are not known and should be further
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Self-reported hypertension is an important piece of
   information for public health that is available in epidemiological
   studies. For proper use of this information, such studies should be
   validated.
   Objective: To validate self-reported hypertension and associated factors
   in adults and elderly individuals in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Methods: Participants were selected from the sample of a
   population-based cross-sectional health survey carried out in Sao Paulo
   (ISA Capital-2008). Their age was 20 years or older, they were from both
   genders, and had their blood pressure measured (n = 535). Hypertension
   was defined as blood pressure >= 140/90 mmHg and/or use of medication
   for hypertension. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
   (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and Kappa coefficient were
   calculated. Poisson regression was used to identify factors associated
   with sensitivity of self-reported hypertension.
   Results: Sensitivity of self-reported hypertension was 71.1\% (95\%CI:
   64.8 to 76.9), specificity 80.5\% (95\%CI: 75.6 to 84.8), PPV 73.7\%
   (95\%CI: 67.4 to 79.3), and NPV 78.5\% (95\%CI: 73.5 to 82.9). There was
   moderate agreement between self-reported hypertension and hypertension
   as diagnosed by blood pressure measurement (kappa = 0.52, 95\%CI: 0.45
   to 0.59). Body mass index and level of education were independently
   associated with sensitivity (body mass index >= 25 kg/m(2): PR = 1.42,
   95\% CI: 1.15 to 1.76; schooling >= 9 years: PR = 0.71 95\% CI:
   0.54-0.94).
   Conclusion: Self-reported hypertension was shown to be valid in adults
   and the elderly in the city of Sao Paulo, and is thus an appropriate
   indicator for the surveillance of hypertension prevalence in the absence
   of blood pressure measurement. Overweight was positively associated with
   validity of self-reported hypertension. Further studies are needed to
   elucidate the inverse association between the validity of self-reported
   hypertension and level of education. (Arq Bras Cardiol.

Title = {{Variations in low birth weight and preterm delivery among blacks in
   relation to ancestry and nativity: New York City, 1998-2002}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES. Black women in the United States are more likely to give
   birth to preterm and low birth-weight infants than their white
   counterparts, but little is known about variation in birth outcomes
   within the black population. This study aimed to test the hypothesis
   that the risk of low birth weight and preterm birth within the black
   population varies by maternal ancestry and nativity.
   POPULATION AND METHODS. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using
   New York City birth records. All of the recorded live births to black
   women occurring in New York City between January 1, 1998, and December
   31, 2002 (N=168 039), were divided into the following self-reported
   ancestry groups: African, American, Asian, Cuban, European, Puerto
   Rican, South and Central American ( excluding Brazilian), and West
   Indian and Brazilian. To estimate adjusted risk ratios for low birth
   weight (weight at birth < 2500g) and preterm birth (gestational age at
   delivery < 37 weeks, based on clinical estimate), we ran 3 models for
   each outcome, using negative binomial regression and Poisson regression
   with robust SE estimation. All of the models used blacks reporting
   American ancestry as the reference group. The first model included
   ancestry as the primary exposure variable along with covariates that
   included maternal age, parity, smoking, and education, as well as
   paternal education and race. Nativity (US-or foreign-born) was included
   in the second model, and terms representing interaction effects between
   ancestry and nativity were included in the third model.
   RESULTS. There was substantial variation in risks of preterm birth and
   low birth weight among the black subgroups, with all of the groups
   having lower risks than the American black reference group, even after
   adjusting for maternal risk factors and other covariates. Risk ratios
   for low birth weight ranged from 0.55 among South/Central Americans to
   0.91 among Cubans; risk ratios for preterm birth showed a similar
   pattern. Nativity was also associated with low birth weight and preterm
   birth; births to foreign-born women were less likely to be preterm or
   lowbirth weight than births to US-born women. Furthermore, nativity
   effects varied by ancestry group, with foreign-born status inversely
   associated with poor birth outcomes among South/Central Americans but
   not among West Indians/Brazilians.
   CONCLUSIONS. Important health differences may be masked in studies that
   treat black women in America as a homogeneous group and do not take
   ethnic variation and nativity into account.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Indwelling devices (eg, urinary catheters and feeding tubes)
   are often used in nursing homes (NHs). Inadequate care of residents with
   these devices contributes to high rates of multidrug-resistant organisms
   (MDROs) and device-related infections in NHs.
   OBJECTIVE To test whether a multimodal targeted infection program (TIP)
   reduces the prevalence of MDROs and incident device-related infections.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial at 12
   community-based NHs from May 2010 to April 2013. Participants were
   high-risk NH residents with urinary catheters, feeding tubes, or both.
   INTERVENTIONS Multimodal, including preemptive barrier precautions,
   active surveillance for MDROs and infections, and NH staff education.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the prevalence
   density rate of MDROs, defined as the total number of MDROs isolated per
   visit averaged over the duration of a resident's participation.
   Secondary outcomes included new MDRO acquisitions and new clinically
   defined device-associated infections. Data were analyzed using a
   mixed-effects multilevel Poisson regression model (primary outcome) and
   a Cox proportional hazards model (secondary outcome), adjusting for
   facility-level clustering and resident-level variables.
   RESULTS In total, 418 NH residents with indwelling devices were
   enrolled, with 34 174 device-days and 6557 anatomic sites sampled.
   Intervention NHs had a decrease in the overall MDRO prevalence density
   (rate ratio, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.62-0.94). The rate of new
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus acquisitions was lower in
   the intervention group than in the control group (rate ratio, 0.78; 95\%
   CI, 0.64-0.96). Hazard ratios for the first and all (including
   recurrent) clinically defined catheter-associated urinary tract
   infections were 0.54 (95\% CI, 0.30-0.97) and 0.69 (95\% CI, 0.49-0.99),
   respectively, in the intervention group and the control group. There
   were no reductions in new vancomycin-resistant enterococci or resistant
   gram-negative bacilli acquisitions or in new feeding tube-associated
   pneumonias or skin and soft-tissue infections.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our multimodal TIP intervention reduced the
   overall MDRO prevalence density, new methicillin-resistant S aureus
   acquisitions, and clinically defined catheter-associated urinary tract
   infection rates in high-risk NH residents with indwelling devices.
   Further studies are needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this
   approach as well as its effects on the reduction of MDRO transmission to
   other residents, on the environment, and on referring hospitals.}},

Abstract = {{Nucleic acids are strongly negatively charged, and thus electrostatic
   interactions-screened by ions in solution play an important role in
   governing their ability to fold and participate in biomolecular
   interactions. The negative charge creates a region, known as the ion
   atmosphere, in which cation and anion concentrations are perturbed from
   their bulk values. Ion counting experiments quantify the ion atmosphere
   by measuring the preferential ion interaction coefficient: the net total
   number of excess ions above, or below, the number expected due to the
   bulk concentration. The results of such studies provide important
   constraints on theories, which typically predict the full
   three-dimensional distribution of the screening cloud. This article
   reviews the state of nucleic acid ion counting measurements and
   critically analyzes their ability to test both analytical and
   simulation-based models.}},

Abstract = {{Distributional identities for a Levy process X-t, its quadratic
   variation process V-t and its maximal jump processes, are derived, and
   used to make ``small time{''} (as t down arrow 0) asymptotic comparisons
   between them. The representations are constructed using properties of
   the underlying Poisson point process of the jumps of X. Apart from
   providing insight into the connections between X, V, and their maximal
   jump processes, they enable investigation of a great variety of limiting
   behaviours. As an application, we study ``self-normalised{''} versions
   of Xt, that is, Xt after division by SuP(0<s <= t) Delta X-s, or by
   sup(0<s <= t) vertical bar Delta X-s vertical bar Thus, we obtain
   necessary and sufficient conditions for X-t/ sup(0<s <= t) Delta X-s and
   X-t/ suP(0<s <= t) vertical bar Delta X-s vertical bar to converge in
   probability to 1, or to infinity, as t down arrow 0, so that Xis either
   comparable to, or dominates, its largest jump. The former situation
   tends to occur when, the singularity at 0 of the Levy measure of X is
   fairly mild (its tail is slowly varying at 0), while the latter
   situation is related to the relative stability or attraction to
   normality of X at 0 (a steeper singularity at 0). An important component
   in the analyses is the way the largest positive and negative jumps
   interact with each other. Analogous ``large time{''} (as t -> infinity)
   versions of the results can also be obtained.}},

Journal = {{ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{31}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this contribution, a simplified macroscopic and semi-analytical
   thermal analysis of directed energy deposition (DED) is presented to
   obtain computationally efficient simulations of the entire process.
   Solidification and solid-state phase transitions are taken into account.
   The model is derived for laser metal powder directed energy deposition,
   although it can be simply adapted for other focused thermal energy
   (e.g., electron beam, or plasma arc). The gas flow used for carrying the
   powder significantly influences cooling conditions, which is included in
   the model. The proposed simulation strategy applies to multilayer
   composites with a wide range of shapes in the horizontal plane and
   arbitrary laser scanning strategies (continuous way, back and forth,
   etc.). The proposed work provides a simple tool to study the influence
   of most process parameters, design in situ experiments and in turn
   develop optimization loops to reach material requirements and specific
   microstructures. In situ pyrometer measurements have been compared to
   the model, and good agreement has been observed with 2.6\% error in
   average. The model is used to demonstrate the effect of various process
   parameters for a simple cylindrical geometry and a more complex auxetic
   cell.}},

Abstract = {{Recently natrolite was shown to be an auxetic material that is able to
   exchange extra-framework Na+ cations with other mono-, di-, and
   trivalent cations. Under pressure up to several GPa, these
   cation-exchanged natrolites undergo superhydration and/or phase
   transformations in the cation-water arrangement. Using density
   functional theory we studied in silico the ion exchange in natrolites.
   First we optimized the structures of Li+-, Na+-, K+-, Rb+-, and
   Cs+-exchanged natrolites at ambient conditions and compared the
   resulting lattice energies to that of the hypothetical H-form of
   natrolite. Of all natrolites, the smallest formal exchange energy was
   found for Na-NAT, in agreement with the natural occurrence of this
   material. Then we modeled the effect of pressure on Na-, Rb-, and
   Cs-natrolites, addressing (i) the incorporation of water ligands into
   the zeolite framework, accompanied by an increase in volume; and (ii)
   the changes in the cation-water arrangement within the zeolite pores.
   The computational models reproduce reasonably well the critical
   pressure, at which these phenomena occur, and, in the case of Cs-NAT,
   point toward a cation displacement model for its structural transition
   under pressure.}},

   to find an ideal geometry for the shear layer while meeting its
   requirements of shear properties (about 6.5 MPa effective shear modulus
   and 0.15 maximum effective shear strain) with polycarbonate as base
   material. Finite Element (FE) based numerical tests are carried out and
   optimum chiral meso-structures are found for the target shear
   properties. Parametric studies on geometries are also conducted to find
   the effect of geometries on the target properties. The effect of cell
   wall thickness is studied and the optimum thickness is suggested to meet
   the target requirements. Effect of direction of shear loading has been
   studied on each different configuration in order to minimize the effect

Abstract = {{The design and construction of 3D architectures enabled by
   stimuli-responsive soft materials can yield novel functionalities for
   next generation soft-bodied actuating devices. Apart from additive
   manufacturing processes, origami inspired technology offers an
   alternative approach to fabricate 3D actuators from planar materials.
   Here we report a class of near-infrared (NIR) responsive 3D active
   origamis that deploy, actuate and transform between multistable
   structural equilibria. By exploiting the nonlinear coefficient of
   thermal expansion (CTE) of graphene oxide (GO), graphene oxide/ethylene
   cellulose (GO/EC) bilayers are readily fabricated to deliver precise
   origami structure control, and rapid low-temperature-triggered
   photothermal actuation. Complexity in 3D shapes is produced through
   heterogeneously patterning GO domains on 2D EC thin films, which allows
   us to customize 3D architectures that adapt to various robotic
   functions. The strategy also enables the construction of material
   systems possessing naturally inaccessible properties, such as remotely
   controlled mechanical metamaterials with auxetic behavior and bionic
   flowers with a rapid blooming rate. Harnessing deformability with
   multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) upon light irradiation, this work
   leads to breakthroughs in the design and implementation of
   shape-morphing functions with soft origamis.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{185}},

Abstract = {{The performance of balloon expandable stents during deployment is
   usually assessed computationally. Most stents have a generic feature
   that entails wavy rings known as ``crowns{''} which are interconnected
   via structures known as ``bridges{''}. A mathematically exact analyses
   of such wavy rings would provide a benchmark to such computations and
   offer a clear insight into the deformation of stents. In the present
   work, an analytical model is developed to estimate the elasto-plastic
   response of a cylindrical periodic structure made of sinusoidal crowns
   interconnected by bridges. Two different interconnections are considered
   that give rise to two distinctive behaviours one of which is auxetic.
   Elastic-perfectly plastic material is considered. The apparent
   elasto-plastic response of the cylindrical structure is obtained in a
   closed-form by exploiting the periodicity along its longitudinal and the
   circumferential direction. A scaling ansatz is proposed that collapses
   nonlinear response data for different geometries into a family of
   master-curves. Such relationship suggests that the most efficient way to
   increase the apparent stiffness of the structure is to decrease the
   amplitude of the wavy crowns. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundLymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination program in Tanzania
   started in 2000 in response to the Global program for the elimination of
   LF by 2020. Evidence shows a persistent LF transmission despite more
   than a decade of mass drug administration (MDA). It is advocated that,
   regular monitoring should be conducted in endemic areas to evaluate the
   progress towards elimination and detect resurgence of the disease
   timely. This study was therefore designed to assess the status of
   Wuchereria bancrofti infection in Culex quinqefasciatus and Anopheles
   species after six rounds of MDA in Masasi District, South Eastern
   Tanzania.MethodsMosquitoes were collected between June and July 2019
   using Center for Diseases Control (CDC) light traps and gravid traps for
   indoor and outdoor respectively. The collected mosquitoes were
   morphologically identified into respective species. Dissections and PCR
   were carried out to detect W. bancrofti infection. Questionnaire survey
   and checklist were used to assess vector control interventions and
   household environment respectively. A Poisson regression model was run
   to determine the effects of household environment on filarial vector
   density.ResultsOverall, 12 452 mosquitoes were collected of which 10 545
   (84.7\%) were filarial vectors. Of these, Anopheles gambiae complex, An.
   funestus group and Cx. quinquefasciatus accounted for 0.1\%, 0.7\% and
   99.2\% respectively. A total of 365 pools of Cx. quinquefasciatus (each

   Anopheles species were all negative. All 1859 dissected mosquitoes
   analyzed by microscopy were also negative. Households with modern
   latrines had less mosquitoes than those with pit latrines {[}odds ratio

   as compared to those with screened windows (OR=2.125, P<0.05). More than
   80\% of the participants own bednets while 16.5\% had no
   protection.ConclusionsLF low transmission is still ongoing in Masasi

   findings also suggest that molecular tools may be essential for
   xenomonitoring LF transmission during elimination phase.}},

Abstract = {{Bridging both the edges and the center of multicomponent space, which
   have been widely investigated in traditional alloys and high entropy
   alloys respectively, is significant but difficult in the design of
   alloys. In this paper, the single-crystal elastic constant model of the
   quaternary BCC Nb-Ti-V-Zr system across full composition space was
   established using first principles combined with the CALPHAD model. The
   accuracy of the model was confirmed by comparing with previous
   calculations and experiments. Using the fitted model, the alloying
   effect on stability and polycrystalline elastic properties of the
   current research system was analyzed. We find that there exists an area
   where BCC becomes unstable, and all the instability is caused by
   breaking C-11-C-12 > 0. And all of the stable Nb-Ti-V-Zr is ductile. In
   addition, there lies a surface on which the alloys are completely
   isotropic in elasticity. Furthermore, some alloys promising in some
   special aspects are predicted, such as gum metal, directional auxetic
   properties and biomedical application materials.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of oral
   health conditions on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in
   population-based sample of Brazilian preschool children. A further aim
   was to identify the influence of socio-demographic profile and
   perceptions regarding general health and oral health status on OHRQoL.
   Methods: An epidemiological survey was carried out at public and private
   preschools in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The sample consisted
   of 1632 5-year-old male and female preschoolers randomly selected using
   a multi-stage sampling technique and their parents/caregivers. Oral
   examinations of the children were performed by a single, previously
   calibrated examiner for the assessment of dental caries experience,
   malocclusion, traumatic dental injury and developmental defects of
   enamel. Caregivers were asked to complete the Brazilian Early Childhood
   Oral Health Impact Scale (B-ECOHIS) and a form on socio-demographic
   data. Descriptive, bivariate and adjusted Poisson regression model
   analyses were carried out. Results: In the child section of the
   B-ECOHIS, OHRQoL was negatively impacted by decayed, missing and filled
   teeth {[}prevalence ratios (PR) = 2.18; 95\% CI, 1.88-2.52], position of
   the child among siblings in the family (PR = 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.39),
   type of preschool (PR = 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.10 -1.69), age of
   parents/caregivers (PR = 1.18; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.34), monthly household
   income (PR = 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.18-1.85) and perception of the child's
   general health status (PR = 1.26; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.51). In the family
   section, the adjusted results demonstrated a negative impact on OHRQoL
   associated with dental caries experience (PR = 3.40; 95\% CI,
   2.83-4.08), age of parents/caregivers (PR = 1.16; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.33)
   and monthly household income (PR = 1.41; 95\% CI, 1.16-1.72).
   Conclusions: Dental caries experience was the only normative criteria
   with a negative impact on OHRQoL. Families with low income and younger
   parents reported a greater impact on quality of life. According to
   parents' perceptions, a poor general health status rating was related to
   poorer quality of life among the children.}},

Abstract = {{Folding of links-links knitted structures is based on the structural
   disequilibrium of face and reverse loops, which causes the fabric to
   form a 3-dimensional structure. Foldable structures shrink in both
   course and wale directions when relaxed. Under the applied strain in the
   horizontal or vertical direction, 3-dimensional structures smooth into a
   flat fabric, creases unfold and the structures expand in both
   directions. Fabric thickness increases with folding. Compressibility
   means a decrease in initial thickness due to the increase in compressive
   force at measuring time. It is affected by knitting parameters such as
   density, fabric thickness, texture etc. The aim of the research was to
   evaluate the compressibility of links-links weft knitted fabrics with a
   zigzag structure which could potentially be used as a packaging and
   mechanical damage protection material. The influence of the yarn
   material composition and repeat size on the compression properties of
   foldable links-links knitted structures was examined in order to
   evaluate their adequacy for compression resistant materials.}},

Title = {{Examining the association of changes in minimum wage with health across
   race/ethnicity and gender in the United States}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: The minimum wage creates both winners (through wage
   increases) and-potentially-losers (through job losses). Research on the
   health effects of minimum wage policies has been sparse, particularly
   across gender and among racial/ethnic minorities. We test the impact of
   minimum wage increases on health outcomes, health behaviors and access
   to healthcare across gender and race/ethnicity.
   Methods: Using 1993-2014 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor
   Surveillance System, variables for access to healthcare (insurance
   coverage, missed care due to cost), health behavior (exercise, fruit,
   vegetable and alcohol consumption) and health outcomes (self-reported
   fair/poor health, hypertension, poor physical health days, poor mental
   health days, unhealthy days) were regressed on the product of the ratio
   of the 1-year lagged minimum wage to the state median wage and the
   national median wage, using Linear Probability Models and Poisson
   Regression Models for dichotomous and count outcomes, respectively.
   Regressions (total population, gender-stratified, race/ethnicity
   stratified (white, black, Latino), gender/race/ethnicity stratified and
   total population with interaction terms for race/ethnicity/gender)
   controlled for state-level ecologic variables, individual-level
   demographics and fixed-effects (state and year).
   Results were adjusted for complex survey design and Bonferroni
   corrections were applied to p-values such that the level of statistical
   significance for a given outcome category was 0.05 divided by the number
   of outcomes in that category. Results: Minimum wage increases were
   positively associated with access to care among white men, black women
   and Latino women but negatively associated with access to care among
   white women and black men. With respect to dietary quality, minimum wage
   increases were associated with improvements, mixed results and negative
   impacts among white, Latino and black men, respectively. With respect to
   health outcomes, minimum wage increases were associated with positive,
   negative and mixed impacts among white women, white men and Latino men,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: While there is enthusiasm for minimum wage increases in the
   public health community, such increases may have to be paired with
   deliberate strategies to protect workers that might be vulnerable to
   economic dislocation. Such strategies may include more robust
   unemployment insurance or increased access to job training for displaced
   workers.}},

Abstract = {{Excitation and luminescence spectra of Pr3+ in LaOCl were measured over
   the spectral range from 11 000 cm(-1) to 22 000 cm(-1). At ambient
   pressure a total of 46 spectral lines could be observed. Under pressures
   up to 16 GPa, all lines exhibit a red-shift-however, with very different
   rates. From the spectral lines, the energy level scheme of the 4f(2)
   configuration could be partly derived. From 37 levels at ambient
   pressure, 30 could also be obtained under pressure. The energy level
   scheme is described by the use of free-ion (F-k (k = 2, 4, 6), alpha,
   beta, gamma, zeta) and crystal-field parameters (B-0(2), B-0(4), B-4(4),
   B-0(6), B-6(6)). According to the so-called nephelauxetic auxetic
   effect, the free-ion parameters F-k and zeta decrease under pressure.
   The magnitudes of the variations depend on the selected energy levels.
   Surprisingly the crystal-field strength shows a peculiar behaviour with
   an initial decrease and a minimum at 15 GPa. This behaviour can be
   explained within the context of the superposition model.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Members of uniformed armed forces are considered to be at high risk for
   HIV infection and have been proposed as suitable candidates for
   participation in HIV intervention studies. We report on the feasibility
   of recruitment and follow up of individuals from the community of the
   Uganda Police Force (UPF) for an HIV vaccine preparedness study.
   Methods
   HIV-negative volunteers aged 18-49 years, were identified from UPF
   facilities situated in Kampala and Wakiso districts through community
   HIV counselling and testing. Potential volunteers were referred to the
   study clinic for screening, enrolment and quarterly visits for one year.
   HIV incidence, retention rates were estimated and expressed as cases per
   100 person years of observation (PYO). Rate ratios were used to
   determine factors associated with retention using Poisson regression
   models.
   Results
   We screened 560 to enroll 500 volunteers between November 2015 and May
   2016. One HIV seroconversion occurred among 431 PYO, for an incidence
   rate of 0.23/100 PYO (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.03-1.64).
   Overall, retention rate was 87\% at one year, and this was independently

   two nights (aRR = 1.27, 95\%CI: 1.04-1.56, compared to those who had not
   travelled) and absence of knowledge on HIV prevention (aRR = 2.67,
   95\%CI: 1.62-4.39).
   Conclusions
   While our study demonstrates the feasibility of recruiting and retaining
   individuals from the UPF for HIV research, we did observe lower than
   anticipated HIV incidence, perhaps because individuals at lower risk of
   HIV infection may have been the first to come forward to participate or
   participants followed HIV risk reduction measures. Our findings suggest
   lessons for recruitment of populations at high risk of HIV infection.}},

   Practice for the Reduction of Diarrheal Disease Among People Living with
   HIV/AIDS, Harar Region, Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{HIV AIDS-RESEARCH AND PALLIATIVE CARE}},
Year = {{2021}},

Pages = {{1-11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Home-based care services like improved water supply,
   sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) practice are vital for people living with
   HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to improve their quality of life. The negative impact
   of inadequate WaSH services is more pronounced among HIV-infected
   individuals leading them to low economic productivity, poor-nourished,
   immuno-compromised, and death. The aim of this study was to investigate
   the adequacy of improved sources of drinking water, sanitation, and
   hygiene practice for the reduction of diarrheal disease among people
   living with HIV/AIDS, Harar region, Ethiopia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 422 PLWHA in the Harar
   region related to WaSH as home-based care services and the prevalence of
   diarrheal disease using a standardized survey questionnaire. Descriptive
   statistics and multivariate Poisson regressions models were performed by
   SPSS Version 25. Using generalized linear models, adjusted prevalence
   ratio (APR) with 95\%Cl and p-value were computed to assess the strength
   of association between the outcome and explanatory variables. A
   significant association was assured when the p-value is less than 0.05.
   Results: In the present study, the two-week prevalence of diarrheal
   disease was 25\%, of which 16\% experienced two or more diarrheal
   episodes. Moreover, 87\% of PLWHA used an improved source of drinking
   water, 66\% used improved sanitation facilities, and 68\% have good
   hygiene practices. Only 37\% of the respondents acquired a basic water
   service level (>= 20lcd) and 58\% of PLWHA acquired the recommended
   quantity of safe water for drinking (>= 1.5lcd). In multivariate
   analysis, the adjusted prevalence ratio of the 2-week prevalence of
   diarrhea was lower by 8\% (APR =1.08; 95\%Cl: 1.02, 1.14), 7\% (APR
   =1.07; 95\%Cl: 1.01, 1.14), and 5\% (APR =1.05; 95\%Cl: 1.00, 1.11)
   among PLWHA who have good hygiene practice, wash their hand with soap 24
   hours before the survey, and used sanitation facility consistently,
   respectively.
   Conclusion: The current study results showed that PLWHA has inadequate
   access to improved drinking water sources, improved sanitation
   facilities, and hygienic practice; these triggers stakeholders for
   proper interventions, effective integration of adequate WaSH services to
   the HIV/AIDS program to enhance the quality of life of PLWHA.}},

Title = {{Association between dietary diversity with overweight and obesity: A
   cross-sectional study conducted among pastoralists in Monduli District
   in Tanzania}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The prevalence of overweight and obesity is rising at a rapid pace and
   is associated with negative health consequences like cardiovascular
   diseases, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Obesity is a multifactorial
   problem that develops mainly from lifestyle factors including physical
   inactivity and poor dietary intake. Dietary diversity is a simplified
   method for assessing the adequacy and quality of diet and is associated
   with nutritional need and overall health status. Therefore, we conducted
   this study to synthesize the associations between consumption of a
   diversified diet and overweight/ obesity among adults living in pastoral
   communities in Monduli district in Tanzania.
   Methods
   This was a cross-sectional study conducted among 510 adults aged >= 18
   years old in the Monduli district, Arusha region in Tanzania. We
   conducted face-to-face interviews to collect information about
   socio-demographic characteristics, 24-hours dietary recall, and
   anthropometric measurements. The dietary diversity score (DDS) was
   constructed and used to determine the diversity of the diet consumed. We
   performed the multivariate Poisson regressions to determine the
   prevalence ratio (PR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). The dependent
   variables were overweight and general obesity as measured by body mass
   index (BMI), abdominal obesity measured by waist-hip ratio (WHR) and
   waist circumference (WC).
   Results
   The prevalence of general obesity based on BMI was 20.2\% (95\%CI;
   16.9-23.9), abdominal obesity based on WHR was 37.8\% (95\%CI;
   33.7-42.1), and WC was 29.1\% (95\%CI; 25.2-33.1). More than half
   (54.3\%) of the participants consumed an adequate dietary diversity (DDS
   >= 4). After adjustment for potential confounders, the prevalence of
   abdominal obesity by WHR decreased with higher DDS among male (APR =
   0.42; 95\% CI, 0.22-0.77) and female participants (APR = 0.63; 95\% CI,
   0.41-0.94). There were inconsistent positive associations between DDS
   and prevalence of overweight and general obesity among male and female.
   There was no association between DDS and abdominal obesity by WC.
   Conclusion
   More than half of the pastoralists have consumed an adequate diversified
   diet. Given the inconsistent findings on associations between dietary
   diversity and obesity measures, this study suggests that targeting
   dietary diversity as an overweight/obesity prevention strategy requires
   careful consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Mental health disorders may negatively impact HIV outcomes,
   such as viral suppression (VS) and antiretroviral (ART) adherence among
   people with HIV (PWH) with hazardous alcohol use. This study evaluates
   the longitudinal association between depression, anxiety symptoms, VS
   and complete ART adherence among ART clients with hazardous alcohol use
   in Vietnam; and examines alcohol dependence as a modifier in this
   association. Methods This was a secondary data analysis of a trial for
   hazardous drinking ART clients in Thai Nguyen, Vietnam. From March 2016
   to May 2018, 440 ART clients with an Alcohol Use Disorders
   Identification Test-Concise (AUDIT-C) score >= 4 for men and >= 3 for
   women were enrolled. Individuals were randomized to either a combined
   intervention, a brief intervention or a standard of care. Data on
   sociodemographics, depression, anxiety symptoms, alcohol use, VS and ART
   adherence were collected at baseline, three, six, and twelve months.
   Generalized estimating equation models controlling for intervention
   exposure were used to estimate time-lagged associations. Risk ratios
   were estimated using Poisson regression with robust variance estimation.
   Results The mean age of participants was 40.2. The majority was male
   (96.8\%), had at least some secondary school education (85.0\%) and had
   a history of injection drug use (80.9\%). No overall effect of
   depression and anxiety symptoms on VS was observed. When stratified by
   time, increased anxiety symptoms at six months were associated with VS
   at 12 months (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.09; 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.17).
   An increase in depression or anxiety symptoms was associated with a
   decreased probability of complete ART adherence (depression symptoms:
   aRR = 0.95; 95\% CI: 0.91 to 0.99; anxiety symptoms: aRR = 0.93; 85\%
   CI: 0.88 to 0.99). The negative effects of anxiety symptoms on ART
   adherence were stronger among participants with alcohol dependence,
   compared to those without. Conclusions Depression and anxiety symptoms
   had no overall effect on VS, although they were associated with a lower
   probability of complete ART adherence. Interventions focusing on mental
   healthcare for PWH with hazardous alcohol use are needed, and
   integration of mental healthcare and alcohol reduction should be
   implemented in HIV primary care settings.}},

Title = {{Discovering structural complexity and its causes: Breeding aggregations
   in horseshoe crabs}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{143}},
Pages = {{177-191}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In some species, especially those that form breeding aggregations, males
   form groups around females vying for fertilizations. These mating groups
   are often highly variable in size even during a single breeding event.
   We examined this variation in the American horseshoe crab, Limulus
   polyphemus, a species in which some females (nesting in pairs) attract
   additional males (satellites) and spawn in groups whereas others spawn
   only with their attached male. The observed distribution of group sizes
   often consists of an overabundance of pairs with no satellite males and
   groups with large numbers of satellites. We characterized this variation
   using well-known models of count data, such as the Poisson and negative
   binomial distributions, and evaluated how operational sex ratio (OSR)
   and pair density contribute to the observed variation. We complemented
   this descriptive approach with spatially explicit simulations of the
   group formation process. By comparing our simulation results to the
   observed breeding aggregation data, we identified how simple behavioural
   rules might contribute to the variation we observe. Those rules amount
   to hypotheses about pair and satellite arrival at the beach and
   satellite sampling of and choice among pairs. We found that the observed
   variation could be explained by a consistent high frequency of females
   that attract satellites in combination with males that sample different
   fractions of the beach as pair density and OSR vary. Furthermore, our
   simulations suggested that males are not choosy in joining pairs on the
   beach, despite variation among pairs in the fertilization success
   satellites can achieve. This suggests that new insights might come from
   investigating the costs and benefits of male choice and the sensory
   mechanisms satellite males use to assess the breeding aggregation before
   coming ashore. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal

   method in China-The third mining science innovation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{With the third innovation in science and technology worldwide, China has
   also experienced this marvelous progress. Concerning the longwall mining
   in China, the ``masonry beam theory{''} (MBT) was first proposed in the
   1960s, illustrating that the transmission and equilibrium method of
   overburden pressure using reserved coal pillar in mined-out areas can be
   realized. This forms the so-called ``121 mining method{''}, which lays a
   solid foundation for development of mining science and technology in
   China. The ``transfer rock beam theory{''} (TRBT) proposed in the 1980s
   gives a further understanding for the transmission path of stope
   overburden pressure and pressure distribution in high-stress areas. In
   this regard, the advanced 121 mining method was proposed with smaller
   coal pillar for excavation design, making significant contributions to
   improvement of the coal recovery rate in that era. In the 21st century,
   the traditional mining technologies faced great challenges and, under
   the theoretical developments pioneered by Profs. Minggao Qian and Zhenqi
   Song, the ``cutting cantilever beam theory{''} (CCBT) was proposed in
   2008. After that the 110 mining method is formulated subsequently,
   namely one stope face, after the first mining cycle, needs one advanced
   gateway excavation, while the other one is automatically formed during
   the last mining cycle without coal pillars left in the mining area. This
   method can be implemented using the CCBT by incorporating the key
   technologies, including the directional pre-splitting roof cutting,

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Depressive symptoms and pain are common in
   patients receiving chronic hemodialysis, yet their effect on dialysis
   adherence, health resource utilization, and mortality is not fully
   understood. This study sought to characterize the longitudinal
   associations of these symptoms with dialysis adherence, emergency
   department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and mortality.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements As part of a trial
   comparing symptom management strategies in patients receiving chronic
   hemodialysis, this study prospectively assessed depressive symptoms
   using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9, and pain using the Short-Form
   McGill Pain Questionnaire, monthly between 2009 and 2011. This study
   used negative binomial, Poisson, and proportional hazards regression to
   analyze the longitudinal associations of depressive symptoms and pain,
   scaled based on 5-point increments in symptom scores, with missed and
   abbreviated hemodialysis treatments, ED visits, hospitalizations, and
   mortality, respectively.
   Results Among 286 patients, moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms were
   identified on 788 of 4452 (18\%) assessments and pain was reported on
   3537 of 4459 (79\%) assessments. Depressive symptoms were independently
   associated with missed (incident rate ratio {[}IRR], 1.21; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}95\% CI], 1.10 to 1.33) and abbreviated (IRR,
   1.08; 95\% CI, 1.03 to 1.14) hemodialysis treatments, ED visits (IRR,
   1.24; 95\% CI, 1.12 to 1.37), hospitalizations (IRR, 1.19; 95\% CI, 1.10
   to 1.30), and mortality (IRR, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.11 to 1.77). Pain was
   independently associated with abbreviated hemodialysis treatments (IRR,
   1.03; 95\% CI, 1.01 to 1.06) and hospitalizations (IRR, 1.05; 95\% CI,
   1.00 to 1.10). Severe pain was independently associated with abbreviated
   hemodialysis treatments (IRR, 1.16; 95\% CI, 1.06 to 1.28), ED visits
   (IRR, 1.58; 95\% CI, 1.28 to 1.94), and hospitalizations (IRR, 1.22;
   95\% CI, 1.03 to 1.45), but not mortality (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95\% CI,
   0.81 to 2.96).
   Conclusions Depressive symptoms and pain are independently associated
   with dialysis nonadherence and health services utilization. Depressive
   symptoms are also associated with mortality. Interventions to alleviate
   these symptoms have the potential to reduce costs and improve
   patient-centered outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to highlight major predictors of
   the frequency of sickness absence in a group of workers directly
   involved in customer service. Material and Methods: The study was
   carried out on a random sample of 229 women employed as assistants and
   clerks in post offices. The survey was based on the Subjective Work,
   Health Status and Life Style Characteristics Questionnaire, and sickness
   absence data for the years 2004-2006. Results: The negative binominal
   regression model of sickness absence risk revealed the following
   significant predictors of short-term absence spells (1-29 days): 1)
   marital status, sickness absence risk for single women was (rate ratio
   (RR)) = 1.56 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-2.39) vs. married
   women; 2) post offices employing 7 workers had a rate ratio of sickness
   absence of 1.6 (95\% CI: 1.04-2.42); 13-25 workers - RR = 2.03 (95\% CI:
   1.41-2.93); > 25 workers -RR = 1.82 (95\% CI: 1.15-2.88) compared with
   an average number of 8-12 workers; 3) shift work, RR = 1.57 (95\% CI:
   1.14-2.14); 4) breaks from work - the risk of absence in the case of any
   breaks amounted to RR = 1.5 (95\% CI: 1.07-2.07) in comparison with the
   statutory breaks; 5) self-rated health reported as moderate relative to
   good health, RR = 1.71 (95\% CI: 1.26-2.32); and 6) occurrence of
   respiratory diseases resulted in the risk of RR = 1.51 (95\% CI:
   1.08-2.08). The Poisson regression model of long-term sickness absence
   spells (>= 30 days) revealed the following significant predictors: 1)
   number of clients per shift: 51-100 clients, RR = 3.62 (95\% CI:
   1.07-22.6) compared with a lower number of clients; 2) self-rated
   health, assessed as moderate, RR = 1.97 (95\% CI: 1.06-3.78) and 3)
   household chores performed for at least 4 h a day, RR = 0.4 (95\% CI:
   0.18-0.79). Conclusions: Association between sickness absence and
   workload as well as work organization indicates directions of corrective
   actions, which could reduce the scale of the problem.}},

Abstract = {{Background Experimental analyses of the 3D strain field evolution during
   loading allows for better understanding of deformation and failure
   mechanisms at the meso- and microscale in different materials. In order
   to understand the auxetic behaviour and delamination process in
   paperboard materials during tensile deformation, it is essential to
   study the out-of-plane component of the strain tensor that is, in
   contrast to previous 2D studies, only achievable in 3D.
   Objective The main objective of this study is to obtain a better
   understanding of the influence of different out-of-plane structures and
   in-plane material directions on the deformation and failure mechanisms
   at the meso- and microscale in paperboard samples.
   Methods X-ray tomography imaging during in-situ uniaxial tensile testing
   and Digital Volume Correlation analysis was performed to investigate the
   3D strain field evolution and microscale mechanical behaviour in two
   different types of commercial paperboards and in two material
   directions. The evolution of sample properties such as the spatial
   variation in sample thickness, solid fraction and fibre orientation
   distribution were also obtained from the images. A comprehensive
   analysis of the full strain tensor in paperboards is lacking in previous
   research, and the influence of material directions and out-of-plane
   structures on 3D strain field patterns as well as the spatial and
   temporal quantification of the auxetic behaviour in paperboard are novel
   contributions.
   Results The results show that volumetric and deviatoric strain,
   dominated by the out-of-plane normal strain component of the strain
   tensor, localize in the out-of-plane centre already in the initial
   linear stress-strain regime. In-plane strain field patterns differ
   between samples loaded in the Machine Direction (MD) and Cross Direction
   (CD); in MD, strain localizes in a more well-defined zone close to the
   notches and the failure occurs abruptly at peak load, resulting in
   angular fracture paths extending through the stiffer surface planes of
   the samples. In CD, strain localizes in more horizontal and continuous
   bands between the notches and at peak load, fractures are not clearly
   visible at the surfaces of CD-tested samples that appear to fail
   internally through more well-distributed delamination.
   Conclusions In-plane strain localization preceded a local increase of
   sample thickness, i.e. the initiation of the delamination process, and
   at peak load, a dramatic increase in average sample thickening occurred.
   Different in-plane material directions affected the angles and
   continuity of the in-plane strain patterns as well as the sample and
   fracture properties at failure, while the out-of-plane structure
   affected how the strain fields distributed within the samples.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of the present study was to determine whether
   de-escalation guided by blood cultures for patients with a diagnosis of
   sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock reduces mortality, and
   antimicrobial drug resistance (ADR).
   Methods: A prospective, single-center, cohort study was conducted with
   adults admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, severe sepsis, or
   septic shock at a public hospital in Sorocaba, State of Sao Paulo,
   Brazil, from January 2013 to December 2013. We excluded patients who had
   negative blood cultures. Patients who had replaced the initial empirical
   broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (EAT) by the antibiotic therapy guided
   by blood cultures were compared with those who continued receiving EAT.
   The outcome included mortality and antimicrobial drug resistance. We
   used the Cox regression (proportional hazards regression) and the
   Poisson regression to analyze the association between antibiotic therapy
   guided by blood cultures (ATGBC) and outcomes. The statistical
   adjustment in all models included the following variables: sex, age,
   APACHE II (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II) score and
   SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score.
   Results: Among the 686 patients who were admitted to the intensive care
   unit, 91 were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was
   52.7 years (standard deviation = 18.5 years) and 70.3\% were male. EAT
   was replaced by ATGBC in 33 patients (36.3\%) while 58 patients (63.7\%)
   continued receiving EAT. Overall hospital mortality decreased from
   56.9\% in patients who received EAT to 48.5\% in patients who received
   ATGBC {[}Hazard ratio- HR 0.44 (95\% CI 0.24-0.82), p = 0.009]. There
   was no association between ATGBC and ADR {[}HR 0.90 (95\% CI 0.78 -
   1.03) p = 0.15].
   Conclusions: Although the early and appropriate empirical EAT is
   undoubtedly an important factor prognostic, ATGBC can reduce the
   mortality in these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The extent to which rural-to-urban migration affects risk
   for cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) in Africa is not well understood. We
   investigated prevalence and risk for obesity, diabetes, hypertension and
   precursor conditions by migration status.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional survey in Malawi (February 2013-March
   2017), 13 903 rural, 9929 rural-to-urban migrant and 6741 urban
   residents (>= 18 years old) participated. We interviewed participants,
   measured blood pressure and collected anthropometric data and fasting
   blood samples to estimate population prevalences and odds ratios, using
   negative binomial regression, for CMD, by migration status. In a
   sub-cohort of 131 rural-urban siblings-sets, migration-associated CMD
   risk was explored using conditional Poisson regression.
   Results: In rural, rural-to-urban migrant and urban residents,
   prevalence estimates were; 8.9, 20.9 and 15.2\% in men and 25.4, 43.9
   and 39.3\% in women for overweight/obesity; 1.4, 2.9 and 1.9\% in men
   and 1.5, 2.8 and 1.7\% in women for diabetes; and 13.4, 18.8 and 12.2\%
   in men and 13.7, 15.8 and 10.2\% in women for hypertension.
   Rural-to-urban migrants had the greatest risk for hypertension (adjusted
   relative risk for men 1.18; 95\% confidence interval 1.04-1.34 and women
   1.17: 95\% confidence interval 1.05-1.29) and were the most screened,
   diagnosed and treated for CMD, compared with urban residents. Within
   sibling sets, rural-to-urban migrant siblings had a higher risk for
   overweight and pre-hypertension, with no evidence for differences by
   duration of stay.
   Conclusions: Rural-to-urban migration is associated with increased CMD
   risk in Malawi. In a poor country experiencing rapid urbanization,
   interventions for the prevention and management of CMD, which reach
   migrant populations, are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aimed to investigate the associations of multiple
   metals with chromosome damage, and further explore the mediation roles
   of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their potentials in lung cancer.
   Methods: We determined the urinary levels of 23 metals, lymphocytic
   micronucleus (MN) frequency, and ten candidate miRNAs in plasma among
   365 healthy workers. Poisson and linear regression models were conducted
   to analyze the associations of urinary metals with MN frequency and
   miRNAs, respectively. The mediation effects of miRNAs on the metal-MN
   frequency associations were assessed by causal mediation analysis.
   Additionally, the levels of effective metal and miRNAs were measured in
   43 pair-wised tumor and normal lung tissues.
   Results: The urinary level of titanium was inversely associated with MN
   frequency after Bonferroni correction {[}frequency ratio (FR) and 95\%
   confidence interval (95\% CI) = 0.88 (0.82, 0.94), p = 5.0 x 10(-4)]. A
   doubling in urinary titanium was associated with 14.72\%-38.17\%
   decrease in plasma miRNAs. After multiple comparison, miR-24-3p and
   miR-28-5p significantly mediated 24.8\% (7.7\%, 70.0\%) and 20.4\%
   (5.7\%, 52.0\%) of the association between titanium and MN frequency
   (p(mediation) = 0.002 and 0.004, respectively). Besides, a doubling in
   titanium was associated with a separate 53.4\% and 47.2\% decreased
   miR-24-3p and miR-28-5p expression in normal lung tissues. Lower
   titanium but higher levels of miR-24-3p and miR-28-5p were shown in
   tumor than normal tissues of lung squamous cell carcinoma patients (all
   p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Our study proposed the negative associations of titanium
   with chromosome damage and lung cancer, and highlighted the mediating
   roles of miR-24-3p and miR-28-5p. Further investigations are warranted
   to validate these associations and uncover the underlying mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (SAB) in health
   care settings contributes significantly to mortality, and improved
   processes are associated with reduced burden of infection. In Australia,
   health care-associated SAB (HA-SAB) rates are reported as a health care
   performance indicator, but standardized methods for analyzing
   longitudinal data are not applied. Our objective was to evaluate the
   utility of statistical process control chart methodology for reporting
   HA-SAB and flagging higher than expected rates. Methods: A real-world
   test data set was defined as HA-SAB surveillance data collected by 155
   Australian health care facilities between June 1, 2015, and June 30,
   2017. This included 788 HA-SAB events, corresponding to an overall rate
   of 0.7 HA-SAB events per 10 000 occupied bed-days. The u-chart was
   selected as an appropriate tool, given the need for reporting natural
   units (HA-SAB rates) to a range of stakeholders. Facility-level data
   were plotted as u-charts, applying warning and control limits (2- and
   3-SD thresholds, respectively). Results: Sixty-eight of the 155
   participating facilities (43.9\%) observed at least 1 HA-SAB event
   during the studied period. Using the traditional method of Poisson
   modeling, 56 of these 68 facilities demonstrated overdispersion with
   variance-to-mean ratio spanning 1.03 to 42.82. Modeling by negative
   binomial (NB) distribution was therefore applied to enhance
   functionality. Conclusion: The u-chart is an accessible method for
   monitoring HA-SAB, interpretable by a range of stakeholders. We
   demonstrate the benefit of NB modeling to account for overdispersion,
   providing an effective tool to avoid inappropriate flags while
   maintaining early detection of out-of-control systems throughout a wide
   range of health care settings.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To investigate the role of individual factors (including age,
   health and personal circumstances) and external factors associated with
   clients having a job start while engaging with the Work Programme and
   variations by benefit type.
   Setting The UK Government's main return to work initiative (The Work
   Programme) in Scotland.
   Design Piecewise Poisson regression to calculate incident rate ratios
   using administrative data from 2013 to 2016 to identify factors
   associated with job start.
   Participants 4322 Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) clients not in
   work due to poor health and 8996 Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) clients,
   aged 18-64 years, referred to the Work Programme between April 2013 and
   July 2014.
   Main outcome measures Starting a job and the time to first job start
   after entering the Work Programme.
   Results JSA clients (62\%) were more likely to return to work (RTW) than
   ESA clients (20\%). There is a strong negative relationship between age
   and the predicted probability of having a job start during the 2-year
   engagement with the programme for both JSA and ESA clients. JSA clients
   were most likely to RTW in the first 3 months, while for ESA clients the
   predicted probability of having a first job start was fairly constant
   over the 2 years. Health, including the number of health conditions,
   length of unemployment, client perception of job start and other
   individual factors were associated with job starts for both groups.
   Conclusions Age plays an important role in influencing RTW; however,
   important potentially modifiable factors include the length of
   unemployment, the management of multimorbidity and the individual's
   perception of the likelihood of job start. Future welfare-to-work
   programmes may be improved by providing age-specific interventions which
   focus on health and biopsychosocial factors to enable more people to
   realise the potential health benefits of RTW.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the
   United States and Europe has led to changes in the incidence of cancers
   among HIV-infected persons, including dramatic decreases in Kaposi
   sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and increases in Hodgkin lymphoma,
   liver, and anogenital malignancies. We sought to evaluate whether
   increasing availability of ART is associated with changing cancer
   incidence in Uganda.
   Methods: Incident cases of 10 malignancies were identified from Kampala
   Cancer Registry from 1999 to 2008. ART coverage rates for Uganda were
   abstracted from the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS reports.
   Negative binomial and Poisson regression modeled the association between
   ART coverage and age-adjusted cancer incidence.
   Results: ART coverage in Uganda increased from 0\% to 43\% from 1999 to
   2008. With each 10\% increase in ART coverage, incidence of Kaposi
   sarcoma decreased by 5\% {[}incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.95, 95\%
   confidence interval: 0.91 to 0.99, P = 0.02] and stomach cancer
   decreased by 13\% {[}IRR = 0.87 (95\% CI: 0.80 to 0.95), P = 0.002].
   Conversely, incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma increased by 6\% {[}IRR =
   1.06 (95\% CI: 1 to 1.12), P = 0.05], liver cancer by 12\% {[}IRR = 1.12

   1.05 (95\% CI: 1 to 1.10), P = 0.05], and breast cancer by 5\% {[}IRR =
   1.05 (95\% CI: 1 to 1.11), P = 0.05]. ART coverage was not associated
   with incidence of invasive cervical cancer, lung, colon, and Hodgkin
   disease. These findings were similar when restricted to histologically
   confirmed cases.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that AIDS-defining malignancies and
   other malignancies are likely to remain significant public health
   burdens in sub-Saharan Africa even as ART availability increases.}},

   That Chitosan Has a Similar Capability to Induce a Proton-Sponge Effect

Abstract = {{Polycations having a high buffering capacity in the endosomal pH range,
   such as polyethylenimine (PEI), are known to be efficient at delivering
   nucleic acids by overcoming lysosomal sequestration possibly through the
   proton sponge effect, although other mechanisms such as membrane
   disruption arising from an interaction between the polycation and the
   endosome/lysosome membrane, have been proposed. Chitosan is an efficient
   delivery vehicle for nucleic acids, yet its buffering capacity has been
   thought to be significantly lower than that of PEI, suggesting that the
   molecular mechanism responsible for endolysosomal escape was not proton
   sponge based. However, previous comparisons of PEI and chitosan
   buffering capacity were performed on a mass concentration basis instead
   of a charge concentration basis, the latter being the most relevant
   comparison basis because polycation-DNA complexes form at ratios of
   charge groups (amine to phosphate), rather than according to mass. We
   hypothesized that chitosan has a high buffering capacity when compared
   to PEI on a molar basis and could therefore possibly mediate
   endolysosomal release through the proton sponge effect. In this study,
   we examined the ionization behavior of chitosan and chitosan-DNA
   complexes and compared to that of PEI and polylysine on a charge
   concentration basis. A mean field theory based on the use of the
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation and an Ising model were also applied to model
   ionization behavior of chitosan and PEI, respectively. We found that
   chitosan has a higher buffering capacity than PEI in the endolysosomal
   pH range, while the formation of chitosan-DNA complexes reduces chitosan
   buffering capacity because of the negative electrostatic environment of
   nucleic acids that facilitates chitosan ionization. These data suggest
   that chitosans have a similar capacity as PEI to mediate endosomal
   escape through the proton sponge effect, possibly in a manner which
   depends on the presence of excess chitosan.}},

Title = {{Satisfaction, discomfort, obligations, and concerns in population-based
   breast cancer screening: cross-sectional study in a Danish population}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Potential barriers to breast cancer screening adherence
   include patient satisfaction, as well as pain, feeling obliged to
   participate, and other concerns that might compromise the level of
   satisfaction.
   The present study aimed to assess the overall satisfaction of Danish
   citizens with their breast cancer screening experiences, as well as
   their level of discomfort, concerns, and feelings of obligation to
   participate. Furthermore, we analyzed the associations between overall
   satisfaction and the remaining outcomes.
   Methods: Questionnaires were mailed to 3000 women in the Central Denmark
   Region who received screening examination results in the fall of 2013.
   The questionnaire assessed satisfaction (overall, telephone hot-line,
   and web-based self-service), discomfort (pain and boundaries of
   modesty), concerns (at invitation, while waiting for results, and after
   receiving results), and feelings of obligation to participate.
   Background information was retrieved from Statistics Denmark.
   Pearson's chi-square test was used to test differences in outcomes and
   demographic characteristic distributions between respondents and
   non-respondents and highly satisfied vs. less satisfied participants.
   Prevalence ratios (PR) with 95\% CI were assessed using Poisson
   regression with robust variance, to estimate associations between
   satisfaction and the remaining outcomes.
   Results: Among the participants, 70.3\% and 29.4\%, respectively,
   reported really good and good impressions of the screening program.
   Lower satisfaction was associated with feeling pain (prevalence ratio
   (PR), 0.82), feeling that modesty boundaries were transgressed (PR,
   0.79), experiencing screening-induced concerns (PR, 0.84), and feeling
   obliged to participate (PR, 0.96). Of the participants, 36.2\% and
   12.9\%, respectively, felt very much and moderately obliged to
   participate. A total of 72.6\% reported no screening-induced concerns,
   including 73.3\% of those with negative screening results and 38.1\% of
   those with positive screening results.
   Conclusions: Overall satisfaction with breast cancer screening was very
   high, but discomfort, feelings of obligation, and concerns were
   associated with lower satisfaction levels. A continuing focus on high
   service in breast cancer screening is important for achieving the
   highest benefit from the program. This includes initiatives to employ
   the least painful techniques, to respect the patients' modesty as much
   as possible, and to deliver fast screening results and thus minimize
   concerns among women awaiting results.}},

Abstract = {{Background. High costs of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have led
   health-care insurers to limit access worldwide. Using a natural
   experiment, we evaluated the impact of removing fibrosis stage
   restrictions on hepatitis C (HCV) treatment initiation rates among
   people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and then examined
   who was left to be treated.
   Methods. Using data from the Canadian HIV-HCV Coinfection Cohort, we
   applied a difference-in-differences approach. Changes in treatment
   initiation rates following the removal of fibrosis stage restrictions
   were assessed using a negative binomial regression with generalized
   estimating equations. The policy change was then specifically assessed
   among people who inject drugs (PWID). We then identified the
   characteristics of participants who remained to be treated using a
   modified Poisson regression.
   Results. Between 2010-2018, there were a total of 585 HCV initiations
   among 1130 eligible participants. After removing fibrosis stage
   restrictions, DAA initiations increased by 1.8-fold (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] 1.3-2.4) controlling for time-invariant differences and
   secular trends. Among PWID the impact appeared even stronger, with an
   adjusted incidence rate ratio of 3.6 (95\% CI 1.8-7.4). However, this
   increased treatment uptake was not sustained. At 1 year following
   universal access, treatment rates declined to 0.8 (95\% CI .5-1.1).
   Marginalized participants (PWID and those of indigenous ethnicity) and
   those disengaged from care were more likely to remain HCV RNA positive.
   Conclusions. After the removal of fibrosis restrictions, HCV treatment
   initiations nearly doubled immediately, but this treatment rate was not
   sustained. To meet the World Health Organization elimination targets,
   the minimization of structural barriers and adoption of tailored
   interventions are needed to engage and treat all vulnerable populations.}},

Title = {{Major depressive episode among university students in Southern Brazil}},
Journal = {{REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{54}},
Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Depression is the leading cause of disability around the
   world, and it has been increasingly affecting young people. This study
   evaluates the prevalence and factors associated with major depression in
   university students, with emphasis on the influence of the academic
   field, chosen study area and the environment they are inserted.
   METHODS: A census of students who entered the university in the first
   semester of 2017 was held at a university in Southern Brazil. The
   outcome of major depressive episode was evaluated using the Patient
   Health Questionnaire-9, considered when the individual had five or more
   depressive symptoms for at least one week. Its prevalence was estimated,
   and the associated factors were examined by the hierarchical
   multivariable analysis using the Poisson regression model.
   RESULTS: A total of 32\% (95\% confidence interval 29.9-34.2) of
   university students presented a major depressive episode, and the
   problem was more frequent among women (prevalence ratio {[}PR] = 1.59);
   people aged 21 to 23 years (PR = 1.24); those with a family history of
   depression (PR = 1.27); minorities' sexual orientation (homosexuals, PR
   = 1.64, and bisexuals, PR = 1.69); who lived with friends or colleagues
   (PR = 1.36); students in the area of applied social and human sciences
   (PR = 1.28), and linguistics, language and literature, and art (PR =
   1.25). The worst academic performance (PR = 2.61), alcohol abuse (PR =
   1.25), and illicit drug use (PR = 1.30) were also positively associated
   with major depressive episode.
   CONCLUSION: In addition to individual, family, and behavioral aspects,
   already described as risk factors for major depressive episodes in the
   general population, academic aspects also influence the occurrence of
   depression among university students. Considering the high prevalence of
   major depressive episode and its negative impact on health, public and
   institutional policies are necessary to focus on students' mental health
   promotion and care.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined Papanicolaou (Pap) test utilization, Pap test
   results, and cervical cancer incidence among First Nations (FN) women
   living in Manitoba, Canada taking into account age group, time period,
   and area of residence. Six population-based data sources were linked at
   an individual level. Negative binomial regression was used to compare
   Pap test utilization and results between FN and all other Manitoba (AOM)
   women. Poisson regression was used to compare cervical cancer incidence.
   Among women younger than 25 years, FN were more likely than AOM women to
   have had a Pap test {[}rate ratio (RR) = 1.37, 95\% confidence intervals
   (CI), 1.22-1.53, 18-19 year olds; RR = 1.17, 95\% CI, 1.05-1.31, 20-24
   year olds]. There was no difference in Pap test use for women 25 to 29
   or 30 to 39 years. FN 40 years and older were less likely to have a Pap
   test than AOM women (RR = 0.84, 95\% CI, 0.75-0.93, 40-49 years old; RR

   = 1.60, 95\% CI, 1.48-1.73). The invasive cervical cancer incidence rate
   was double for FN women 25 to 39 years of age (21.9 per 100,000, FN;
   10.2 per 100,000, AOM, P = 0.006) and 40 to 69 years of age (24.3 per
   100,000, FN; 12.3 per 100,000, AOM, P = 0.007). In conclusion, cervical
   cancer screening among FN women over 40 years of age must be increased
   to address the higher cervical cancer incidence. (C) 2014 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the impact of policy and practice changes in
   prenatal screening for Down's syndrome on prenatal diagnosis and live
   birth prevalence of Down's syndrome.
   Design: Population-based observational study.
   Setting: Greater Paris.
   Population: Residents of Greater Paris who gave birth or had a
   termination of pregnancy in Paris during 1981-2000( similar to 38,000
   births per year).
   Methods: Data on 1916 cases of Down's syndrome were obtained from the
   Paris Registry of Congenital Anomalies. Analyses included binomial and
   Poisson models of trends in three periods: prior to 1989(reference
   period), 1989-1995(reimbursement of amniocentesis in case of
   ultrasonographic anomalies) and 1996-2000(widespread use of reimbursed
   serum screening and measurement of nuchal translucency).
   Main outcome measures: Trends in proportion of Down's syndrome cases
   diagnosed prior to birth; live birth prevalence of Down's syndrome.
   Results: The proportion of Down's syndrome detected prenatally for women
   < 38 years of age increased ninefold; from 9.5\% (95\% CI 2.7-22.6) in
   1981 to 84.9\% (95\% CI 74.6-92.2) in 2000. For women > 38 years of age,
   the increase was 1.5-fold. The live birth prevalence of Down's syndrome
   decreased by 3\% per year (prevalence ratio {[}PR] 0.97, 95\% CI
   0.96-0.99); the age-adjusted decrease was 13\%. The analysis by period
   showed that the decrease in live birth prevalence of Down's syndrome was
   greater after 1988.
   Conclusions: By far, most cases of Down's syndrome are currently
   detected prenatally in the Parisian population. Consequently, the live
   birth prevalence of Down's syndrome has decreased despite consistent
   trends towards delayed childbearing. These positive public health
   effects have to be balanced against a relatively high rate of
   amniocentesis and the potentially negative consequences of widespread
   prenatal testing for individuals born with Down's syndrome.}},

   surgical procedure.
   Methods. This was a single-center retrospective cohort study including
   all patients 18 to 40 years of age with a diagnosis of CHD admitted to a
   quaternary care children's hospital cardiac intensive care unit
   postoperatively from 2004 to 2015. We defined AKI using the Kidney
   Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria for serum creatinine. We
   explored potential susceptibilities and exposures for AKI using
   multivariable logistic regression and determined the association of AKI
   with duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay using Poisson
   regression.
   Results. In 699 consecutively admitted patients AKI occurred in 13.2\%.

   cardiac catheterization, repeat cardiopulmonary bypass, bypass time,
   cross-clamp time, and other potential nephrotoxic medications. AKI was
   associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.47;
   95\% CI, 1.15 to 1.89) and intensive care unit length of stay (OR, 1.50;
   95\% CI, 130 to 1.72).
   Conclusions. AKI is common in young adults with CHD postoperatively and
   is associated with negative outcomes. The results highlight the
   importance future research and clinical efforts aimed at prevention and
   improved management of AKI in this patient group. (C) 2019 by The

Abstract = {{Introduction and objectives: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD) is a major public health problem. The aim of this study was to
   ascertain the prevalence of COPD and whether such prevalence was
   positively or negatively associated with COPD admissions, using all the
   data of a regional health care system.
   Materials and methods: We designed a descriptive cross-sectional study
   which included all subjects aged over 45 years, diagnosed with COPD in
   primary care in 2013. We also calculated the number of such patients who
   had a record of hospital admissions due to this disease. COPD prevalence
   and incidence of admissions were calculated. Poisson regression models
   were then used to analyse the association between cases with diagnosis
   of COPD and admissions due to COPD, by sex, adjusting for
   socio-demographic variables and distance to hospital. Sensitivity
   subanalyses were performed by reference to the respective municipal
   rurality indices.
   Results: Median municipal prevalence of COPD was 5.29\% in men and
   2.19\% in women. Among patients with COPD, 28.22\% of men and 16.00\% of
   women had at least one hospital admission. The relative risk of
   admission per unit of the standardised prevalence ratio was 0.37 (95\%
   CI 0.34-0.41) for men and 0.39 (95\% CI 0.34-0.45) for women.
   Conclusions: There is a significant negative association between COPD
   prevalence and hospital admissions due to this disease. The proportion
   of admissions is lower in municipalities lying furthest from hospitals.
   There is considerable municipal variability in terms of COPD prevalence
   and proportion of admissions. In-depth attention should be given to
   disease-management training programmes. (C) 2018 Sociedade Portuguesa de

Abstract = {{Background: ``Zero{''} central line-associated bloodstream infections
   (CLABSI) have not been reported from Asian countries, which usually have
   predominance of difficult to curtail gram negative infections. It also
   remains unclear whether lowering CLABSI rates below National Healthcare
   Safety Network (NHSN) benchmarks in such countries is even possible. In
   this study, we evaluated effects of a quality improvement initiative to
   achieve ``Zero CLABSI{''} in our intensive care unit.
   Methods: A root cause analysis in February 2010 identified problems with
   clinical practice, environment, and products. Extensive education
   sessions were followed by implementation of strategies in the form of
   ``itemized{''} bundles derived from practice guidelines, with complete
   enforcement starting August 2010. Results were benchmarked against NHSN
   data. Data were analyzed in a preintervention (1 year) and
   postintervention (2 years) fashion, using Poisson regression analysis to
   generate incidence-rate ratio (IRR).
   Results: In the preintervention period, CLABSI rate was 6.9/1,000
   catheter-days (CDs) (35 CLABSI/5,083 CDs). In the postintervention year
   1, rate was 1.06/1,000 CDs (4 CLABSI/3,787 CDs) with IRR of 0.15 (95\%
   confidence interval: 0.04-0.44, P < .001) and reduction of 85\%. In
   postintervention year 2, rate was 0.35/1,000 CDs (1/2,860 CDs) with IRR
   of 0.05 (95\% confidence interval: 0.001-0.31, P < .001). There was a
   period of ``Zero CLABSI{''} for 15 consecutive months, surpassing NHSN
   benchmarks.
   Conclusion: : CLABSIs can be eliminated in any intensive care unit
   regardless of the location and type of organism. NHSN data should be a
   realistic CLABSI benchmarking target for developing countries. Copyright

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{130-142}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The Miura-ori pattern possesses intriguing mechanical features, namely,
   the one Degree Of Freedom mobility, auxetic in-plane behavior and energy
   absorption capability, for applications such as core to sandwich
   structure, shock absorber, airless tire, etc. To realize the folding
   mechanism of Miura-ori, in this paper a Miura-ori patterned sheet was
   made from copolymer Elvaloy by compression molding, and then its
   deformation behavior was investigated experimentally and by using finite
   element analysis. The intrinsic mechanical properties of Elvaloy were
   obtained by tensile and four-point-bending tests, respectively, and
   subsequently used in the finite element (FE) simulation. For utilizing
   the sheet in all the principal directions, three types of tests were
   conducted: out-of-plane compression, three-point-bending and in-plane
   compressions. FE simulations using Abaqus/Explicit were carried out to
   analyze the deformations of the patterned sheet under the same loading
   as that in the tests. The simulation results were then compared with the
   tests, which show good agreements. Based on the simulation results, the
   deformation patterns of the patterned sheet under different loading
   conditions were examined, as well as the energy absorption capacity. (C)

Abstract = {{This study investigates the structural compression properties of the
   additive manufactured (AM) Ti-6Al-4V lattice structure using LS-Dyna
   simulation analysis software and calculates its mechanical properties
   under different porosities and different pattern designs. Ti-6Al-4V
   alloys formed by using additive manufacturing produced elliptic holes
   with long and short axes due to the difference in the direction of
   construction. These holes could be eliminated and the materials could be
   compacted by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) treatment. Compactness of the
   frame element achieved 99.9\% and drastically reduced the anisotropic
   behavior caused by the fabrication process. For the experimental
   testing, the samples with different porosities and the A-type and
   AZ-type designs were employed in compression experiment. In the
   meantime, the Young's modulus, the yield strength, plateau stress and
   other mechanical behavior were investigated by CAE simulation. The
   plateau stress, which is an important property for some biomedical
   applications, was calculated with satisfactory accuracy compared with
   experimental measurements. The simulated results of the designed lattice
   structures with different porosity contents were able to adopt the
   Gibson-Ashby model to determine their failure mechanisms. Finally, the
   CAE simulation for the design of an auxetic material was demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a mechanism to generate energy dissipation by
   creating novel multilayer microstructure architectures via nano-inks and
   improving the mechanical, damping and dielectric performance of open
   cell foams. A multilayer carbon nano-ink containing -COOH functionalised

   polyurethane open cell foam structures with the assistance of a silane
   coupling agent. Another layer of water-based polyurethane dispersion is
   coated on top of the MWCNT layer coated foam to transform the single
   foam ribs in multilayer structures. The nano-ink dipping and drying
   process developed in this work creates a porous MWCNT layer with a
   fairly high MWNT content that covers the foam ribs. These carbon
   nanotube multi-layer coated foams show a significant damping performance
   with loss modulus and loss factors 165\% and 100\% higher than those
   from high-dissipation nano-foams fabricated by conventional foaming
   techniques and auxetic phase transformation respectively. These nano-ink
   multilayer coated foams with only one layer also exhibit an increase in
   electrical conductivity by a factor of 2 compared to other existing
   nano-ink coated open cell foams with a substantially higher number of

Abstract = {{Objectives
   The interplay between marijuana legislation, perceptions of risks
   associated with marijuana use, and marijuana-related risk behaviors is
   an ever changing and complex issue. Marijuana impaired driving is of
   concern as legalization continues to expand in the United States. While
   driving after using marijuana has been shown to be prevalent among
   adults, little research has examined the behavior in adolescents. The
   aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence of driving after
   using marijuana among U.S. adolescents, with an examination of the
   relationship to age of marijuana initiation and marijuana usage
   patterns.
   Methods
   We analyzed data from the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationally
   representative sample of high schools students in the U.S. The sample
   was current marijuana users, defined as past 30 day use. Driving after
   using marijuana was the main outcome variable, with analyses examining
   the association between the outcome and age of initiation and patterns
   of use. Prevalence ratios were obtained by modeling Poisson regression
   to examine factors associated with driving under the influence of
   marijuana.
   Results
   Nearly half of all marijuana users reported driving after use during the
   past 30 days, and did not differ between males and females. Prevalence
   of driving after using marijuana was significantly higher among heavy
   users (PR = 2.8; 95\% CI 2.1-3.6). A higher prevalence of driving after
   drinking alcohol (PR = 1.7; 95\% CI 1.5-1.9) was also found among those
   who had driven after using marijuana.
   Conclusions
   Among adolescent marijuana users, the prevalence of driving after using
   marijuana was high. Enhanced surveillance, prevention, and control
   measures are necessary to mitigate the negative impacts of marijuana
   consumption and related behaviors.}},

   variable was receipt of pensions from any source. The exploratory
   variables were age, gender, residence by region and by urban/rural area,
   household arrangements, schooling, household assets, perception of
   income sufficiency, age when started working, number of chronic
   diseases, and functional limitation. The analyses were based on the
   Poisson and binary logistic regressions.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of the receipt of pension was 54.3\%. In the
   multivariate analysis, the following factors showed statistically
   significant (p < 0.05) associations with the outcome: age {[}Prevalence
   Ratio (PR) = 2.59 and 3.24 for 60-69 and 70 years], rural residence (PR
   = 1.23), residence in the Northeast, South and Southeast compared to the
   North (PR ranging from 1.18 to 1.23), living arrangements (PR = 1.07 and
   1.15 for living with one person and living alone), perception of income
   sufficiency (PR = 1.08 and 1.15 for sometimes and always), functional
   limitation (PR = 1.13) and having 1 and >= 2 chronic diseases (PR = 1,09
   and 1,17). Negative association was observed for 5-8 years of education.
   No association between age when the individual started working and the
   outcome was observed. Younger participants (50-59 years old) with >= 2
   diseases or functional limitation were 31\% and 63\% more likely to
   receive pensions, respectively; the strength of these associations
   declined with age.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that health conditions are important
   determinants of early retirement. Discussions to increase age to the
   retirement cannot be separated from those on improvements in the health
   conditions of the Brazilian population.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To establish the effectiveness of a brief, partly web-based group
   intervention, HypoAware, in patients with problematic hypoglycemia, in
   terms of the reduction of severe hypoglycemic episodes, impaired
   hypoglycemia awareness, and worries.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
   A two-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in
   insulin-treated patients with problematic hypoglycemia in eight Dutch
   clinics comparing HypoAware with care as usual. Primary outcomes
   included self-reported severe hypoglycemia, impaired hypoglycemia
   awareness (Gold score), and worries and distress about hypoglycemia
   (Hypoglycemia Fear Survey-II/Problem Areas In Diabetes scale hypo-item),
   assessed at baseline, and at 2, 4, and 6 months of follow-up. We used t
   tests, nonparametric tests, and intention-to-treat generalized
   estimation equation (GEE) analyses with linear, logistic, and Poisson or
   negative binomial models.
   RESULTS
   We enrolled 137 participants. Adjusted GEE analyses over four time
   points showed a nonsignificant 33\% fewer episodes of severe
   hypoglycemia in the HypoAware group compared with the control group
   (relative risk {[}RR] 0.67 {[}95\% CI 0.39-1.16], P = 0.150); a
   significant reduced odds of impaired awareness (odds ratio 0.38 {[}95\%
   CI 0.15-0.95], P = 0.038), a trend toward 20\% fewer worries about
   hypoglycemia (RR 0.80 {[}95\% CI 0.64-1.01], P = 0.059), and a
   significant 30\% less hypo-distress (RR 0.70 {[}95\% CI 0.56-0.88], P =
   0.002). Over the 6-month study duration, participants experienced a
   median of 2.5 events of severe hypoglycemia (interquartile range {[}IQR]
   1-10) in the control condition versus 1 event (IQR 0-6.5) in the
   HypoAware group (P = 0.030). There was no significant change in HbA(1c)
   level within and between both groups.
   CONCLUSIONS
   HypoAware resulted in fewer severe hypoglycemic episodes, significantly
   improved hypoglycemia awareness, and less hypo-distress in comparison
   with usual care, and deserves further dissemination.}},

Abstract = {{With the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and versatile primers that
   amplify the whole cytochrome b gene (approximately 1140 bp), we obtained
   17 complete gene sequences representing three orders of hoofed mammals
   (ungulates) and dolphins (cetaceans).  The fossil record of some
   ungulate lineages allowed estimation of the evolutionary rates for
   various components of the cytochrome b DNA and amino acid sequences. 
   The relative rates of substitution at first, second, and third positions
   within codons are in the ratio 10 to 1 to at least 33.  For deep
   divergences (> 5 million years) it appears that both replacements and
   silent transversions in this mitochondrial gene can be used for
   phylogenetic inference.  Phylogenetic findings include the association
   of (1) cetaceans, artiodactyls, and perissodactyls to the exclusion of
   elephants and humans, (2) pronghorn and fallow deer to the exclusion of
   bovids (i.e., cow, sheep, and goat), (3) sheep and goat to the exclusion
   of other pecorans (i.e., cow, giraffe, deer, and pronghorn), and (4)
   advanced ruminants to the exclusion of the chevrotain and other
   artiodactyls.  Comparisons of these cytochrome b sequences support
   current structure-function models for this membrane-spanning protein. 
   That part of the outer surface which includes the Q(o) redox center is
   more constrained than the remainder of the molecule, namely, the
   transmembrane segments and the surface that protrudes into the
   mitochondrial matrix.  Many of the amino acid replacements within the
   transmembrane segments are exchanges between hydrophobic residues
   (especially leucine, isoleucine, and valine).  Replacement changes at
   first and second positions of codons approximate a negative binomial
   distribution, similar to other protein-coding sequences.  At four-fold
   degenerate positions of codons, the nucleotide substitutions approximate
   a Poisson distribution, implying that the underlying mutational spectrum
   is random with respect to position.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a significant health
   and economic burden in the US. Tobacco, alcohol, and drug use are
   established risk factors. We sought to evaluate the national trend of
   use of each substance in patients admitted with AMI.
   Methods: We used the National Inpatient Sample between 2005 and 2017. We
   included adult patients hospitalized with AMI. International
   Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions codes were used to
   define tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, opioid, cannabis and other drug use.
   Trends of each substance use were assessed using multivariable Poisson
   regression, and were expressed as annual percent change (APC) with their
   95\% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: A total of 10,796,844 hospitalizations with AMI were included.
   Among all substances used, tobacco was the most common (32.7\%),
   followed by alcohol (3.2\%). Between 2005 and 2017, the prevalence ratio
   of tobacco use increased from 21.5\% to 44.5\% with an APC + 6.2\%
   (95\%CI 6.2\%-6.2\%). Tobacco users had more percutaneous coronary
   intervention (41\%vs25\%) and coronary artery bypass surgery
   (6.9\%vs4.9\%), p < 0.001. Further, there were positive trends in
   alcohol (APC + 3.1\%; 95\%CI 3.0\%-3.2\%), opioid (APC + 9.0\%; 95\%CI
   8.7\%-9.2\%), cannabis (APC + 7.2; 95\% CI 7\%-7.4\%), and combined all
   drug use (+ 7.1\%; 95\%CI 7\%-7.2\%). Meanwhile, there was a slight
   negative trend in cocaine use.
   Conclusions: This analysis outlines the national trends of substance use
   in patients admittedwithAMI and reveals an increasing prevalence of
   tobacco use, alcohol and drug use. More effective cessation measures are
   necessary to reduce the risk for AMI and its burden on the healthcare
   system and economy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background There is a large Barrett's esophagus patient population
   undergoing endoscopic surveillance. Methods to stratify patients into
   higher and lower risk groups may enable more varied surveillance
   intervals for patients with non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus that
   could optimize use of endoscopy resources. Objective We aimed to assess
   whether risk of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma differed in
   patients with multiple endoscopic biopsies negative for dysplasia.
   Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study among individuals from
   the population-based Northern Ireland Barrett's register with a
   histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus
   (with intestinal metaplasia) between 1993 and 2010, who had at least one
   endoscopic biopsy conducted at least 12 months after diagnosis. We used
   Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95\%
   confidence intervals (CI) for the association between number of
   successive endoscopies showing non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus and
   risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma alone, and combined with high-grade
   dysplasia, at the next endoscopy. Results We identified 1761 individuals
   who met our eligibility criteria. Subsequent risk of progression to
   esophageal adenocarcinoma was lower at the next endoscopy following two
   endoscopies showing non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (IRR 0.26, 95\%
   CI 0.10-0.66) than following one endoscopy showing non-dysplastic
   Barrett's esophagus. Similar findings were apparent for risk of
   progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma or high-grade dysplasia (IRR
   0.41, 95\% CI 0.22-0.79). Conclusion The lower risk of malignant
   progression in individuals with persistent non-dysplastic Barrett's
   esophagus over two consecutive endoscopic biopsies but not for longer
   term persistence does not support hypotheses of persistence being an
   indicator of less biologically aggressive lesions. Instead, the initial
   difference may be attributable to post-endoscopy cancers and support the
   necessity of adhering to robust quality standards for endoscopic
   procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Dementia prevalence is rising, and it will double in the
   next 20 years. This study sought to understand the prevalence of
   dementia in hospitalized patients with ischemic stroke, and its impact
   on outcomes. Methods: Using the Canadian Institute of Health
   Information's (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database (DAD), all acute
   ischemic stroke admissions from April 2003 to March 2015 in Canada
   (excluding Quebec) were analyzed. Concurrent dementia at the time of
   admission was assessed based on hospital diagnostic codes.
   Characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were compared in patients with
   and without dementia using chi(2) and negative binomial, as well as
   Poisson regression analysis. Results: During the observed period,
   313,138 people were admitted to a hospital in Canada for an ischemic
   stroke. Of those, 21,788 (7.0\%) had a concurrent diagnosis of dementia.
   People with dementia had older median age (84 vs. 76 years; p < 0.0001),
   were more often female (59.6\% vs. 48.4\%; p < 0.0001) and more often
   had Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index >= 2 (64.5\% vs. 43.5\%; p <
   0.0001). Patients with dementia were less likely to be discharged to a
   rehabilitation facility (adjusted risk ratio {[}RR] 3.089, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 2.992-3.188, p < 0.0001) or home
   independently (adjusted RR 0.756, 95\% CI 0.737-0.776, p < 0.0001).
   Interpretation: Approximately 1 in 13 hospitalized ischemic stroke
   patients has coded dementia. Patients with ischemic stroke and
   concurrent dementia have higher mortality, face significantly more
   dependence after stroke and utilize greater healthcare resources than
   stroke patients without dementia. Causative conclusions are limited by
   the administrative data source. Early care planning and coordination
   could potentially optimize outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Little is known of the disease burden of patients with
   persistent asthma (PA) who also have a chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease (COPD) diagnosis code (AS-COPD).
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to characterize and compare
   patients with AS-COPD with those with PA without COPD diagnosis, and
   determine in AS-COPD the relationship between blood eosinophil count and
   future asthma exacerbations.
   METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used administrative pharmacy
   and health care utilization data to identify, characterize, and compare
   the burden and asthma exacerbations in adults with AS-COPD (N = 901)
   with those with PA (N = 2392). Negative binomial regression and Poisson
   regression models were used to evaluate the relationships between
   baseline blood eosinophil counts (high vs low) based on various cutoff
   points and asthma exacerbations in the follow-up year, adjusting for
   demographics, comorbidities, and asthma burden.
   RESULTS: Compared with patients with PA, those with AS-COPD were
   significantly (all P < .001) older, more frequently female, less well
   educated, more likely to be or have been a smoker, had more
   comorbidities, received more asthma controller medications, and had
   greater rates and frequencies of asthma exacerbations, but had similar
   blood eosinophil counts. The rate of asthma exacerbations/person-year in
   AS-COPD during follow-up was 1.61 (95\% CI, 1.18-2.20). Patients with
   AS-COPD with a blood eosinophil count >= 400 cells/mm(3) had an
   increased rate of future asthma exacerbations compared with those whose
   blood eosinophil count was < 400 cells/mm3 (adjusted rate ratio, 1.44,
   95\% CI, 1.09-1.90).
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients with PA, those with AS-COPD had more
   disease burden, but a similar relationship of high blood eosinophil
   count to more future asthma exacerbations. These findings suggest a
   common inflammatory component between AS-COPD and PA. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Background: Multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
   (KPC)-2-producing K. pneumoniae are an increasing cause of
   healthcare-associated infections worldwide.
   Aims: To investigate the impact of clinical infection on mortality, and
   examine the effect of use of KPC-2-specific polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) on the time to contact isolation during an outbreak.
   Methods: Cases were defined as patients clinically infected or colonized
   with KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae between June 2010 and July 2012.
   Cases were described by demographic and health characteristics, and the
   association between infection and mortality, adjusted for comorbidities
   and demographic characteristics, was determined using Poisson regression
   with robust standard errors. A comparison was made between the time to
   contact isolation with a culture-based method and PCR using Wilcoxon's
   rank sum test.
   Findings: Of 72 cases detected, 17 (24\%) had undergone transplantation
   and 21 (29\%) had a malignancy. Overall, 35 (49\%) cases were clinically
   infected, with pneumonia and sepsis being the most common infections.
   Infection was an independent risk factor for mortality (risk ratio 1.67,
   95\% confidence interval 0.99-2.82). The median time to contact
   isolation was 1.5 days (range 0-21 days) using PCR and 5.0 days (range
   0-39 days) using culture-based methods (P = 0.003). Intermittent
   negative tests were observed in 48\% (14/29) of cases tested using
   culture-based methods.
   Conclusion: KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae mainly affect severely ill
   patients. Half of the cases developed clinical infection, associated
   with increased risk of death. As PCR accelerates isolation and provides
   the opportunity for preventive measures in colonized cases, its use
   should be implemented promptly during outbreaks. Further studies are
   needed to enhance knowledge about KPC detection patterns and to adjust
   screening guidelines. (C) 2015 The Healthcare Infection Society.

Abstract = {{Background. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) is a marker of airway
   inflammation. Its role in assessing asthma burden in clinical practice
   needs more study. Objective. To determine whether higher FENO levels are
   associated with greater asthma burden. Methods. This was a multicenter
   cross-sectional retrospective study of atopic 12- to 56-year-old
   persistent asthmatics on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Questionnaire
   and 1-year retrospective administrative data were used to analyze by
   unadjusted and adjusted robust Poisson regression (relative risks) and
   negative binomial regression {[}incidence rate ratios (IRRs)] the
   associations of masked FENO levels (NIOXMINO (R)) to short-acting
   beta-agonist (SABA) dispensings and oral corticosteroid (OCS) use in the
   past year independent of spirometry and an asthma control tool {[}
   Asthma Control Test (ACT)]. Results. FENO levels ranged from 7-215 ppb
   (median 28 ppb) in 325 patients. Higher FENO levels significantly
   correlated with more SABA dispensings and OCS courses in the past year,
   lower FEV(1)\% predicted levels, but not ACT score. FENO highest (>= 48
   ppb) versus lowest (<= 19 ppb) quartile values were associated
   independently in the past year with >= 7 SABA canisters dispensed
   (relative risk = 2.40, 95\% CI = 1.25-4.62) and total number of SABA
   canisters dispensed (IRR = 1.46, 95\% CI = 1.12-1.99) and with = 1 OCS
   course (relative risk = 1.48, 95\% CI = 1.06-2.07) and total number of
   OCS courses (IRR = 1.71, 95\% CI = 1.09-2.66). The significant
   independent relationship of higher FENO levels to increasing SABA
   dispensings and OCS courses was confirmed by linear trend analyses.
   Conclusions. Independent and clinically meaningful associations between
   higher FENO levels and greater asthma burden during a prior year in
   persistent asthmatics on ICS suggest that FENO measurement may be a
   complementary tool to help clinicians assess asthma burden.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To assess the association between cerebral microbleeds
   (CMBs) and future spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) risk in
   ischemic stroke patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF)
   taking oral anticoagulants.
   Methods: This was a meta-analysis of cohort studies with.50 patients
   with recent ischemic stroke and documented AF, brain MRI at baseline,
   long-term oral anticoagulation treatment, and >= 6 months of follow-up.
   Authors provided summary-level data on stroke outcomes stratified by CMB
   status. We estimated pooled annualized ICH and ischemic stroke rates
   from Poisson regression. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) of ICH by CMB
   presence/absence, >= 5 CMBs, and CMB topography (strictly lobar, mixed,
   and strictly deep) using random-effects models.
   Results: We established an international collaboration and pooled data
   from 8 centers including 1,552 patients. The crude CMB prevalence was
   30\% and 7\% for >= 5 CMBs. Baseline CMB presence (vs no CMB) was
   associated with ICH during follow-up (OR 2.68, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI] 1.19-6.01, p = 0.017). Presence of >= 5 CMB was related to higher
   future ICH risk (OR 5.50, 95\% CI 2.07-14.66, p = 0.001). The pooled
   annual ICH incidence increased from 0.30\% (95\% CI 0.04-0.55) among
   CMB-negative patients to 0.81\% (95\% CI 0.17-1.45) in CMB-positive
   patients (p = 0.01) and 2.48\% (95\% CI 1.2-6.2) in patients with >= 5
   CMBs (p = 0.001). There was no association between CMBs and recurrent
   ischemic stroke.
   Conclusions: The presence of CMB on MRI and the dichotomized cutoff of
   >= 5 CMBs might identify subgroups of ischemic stroke patients with AF
   with high ICH risk and after further validation could help in risk
   stratification, in anticoagulation decisions, and in guiding randomized
   trials and ongoing large observational studies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We sought to clarify the association of HIV infection and
   immunodeficiency on myocardial infarction (MI) risk. Methods: We
   conducted a cohort study from 1996 to 2009 of HIV-positive (HIV+) and
   demographically matched HIV-negative (HIV-) Kaiser Permanente California
   health plan members. Rate ratios (RRs) were obtained from Poisson
   regression models comparing MI incidence rates between HIV+ (overall and
   stratified by recent and nadir CD4 count, and recent HIV RNA levels) and
   HIV- subjects, adjusting for age, sex, calendar era, race/ethnicity,
   census-based socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol/drug abuse,
   overweight/obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and lipid-lowering therapy.
   Among HIV+ subjects, we also evaluated the independent association of
   CD4, HIV RNA, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) use. Results: The study
   population included 22,081 HIV+ and 230,069 HIV- subjects. The crude MI
   incidence rate per 100,000 person-years was 283 and 165 for HIV+ and
   HIV- subjects, respectively, with an adjusted RR of 1.4 {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 1.3 to 1.6]. Compared with HIV- subjects
   (reference), MI rates were similar for HIV+ subjects with recent CD4 >=
   500 cells per microliter (RR = 1.18; 95\% CI: 0.96 to 1.45) and those
   with nadir CD4 >= 500 cells per microliter (RR = 0.85; 95\% CI: 0.55 to
   1.33). Among HIV+ subjects, nadir CD4 was the only HIV-specific factor
   associated with MIs (RR per 100 cells = 0.88; 95\% CI: 0.81 to 0.96),
   whereas recent CD4 and HIV RNA, prior ART use, and duration of protease
   inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were not
   associated with MIs. Conclusion: HIV+ subjects with recent or nadir CD4
   >= 500 cells per microliter had similar MI rates compared with HIV-
   subjects. Lower nadir CD4, in particular, seems to be independently
   associated with MIs. These results strengthen recommendations for
   earlier ART initiation.}},

Abstract = {{The large wavenumber suppression of unstable modes by space charge
   effects of the ionization instability in a weakly ionized and
   unmagnetized dusty plasma is investigated. The charge losses in the
   initial equilibrium state are balanced by electron impact ionizations
   originated by both the thermal electron populations and an additional
   monoenergetic electron beam. The multifluid dimensionless equations are
   deduced by using the time and length scales for elastic collisions
   between ions and neutral atoms and the Poisson equation relates the
   plasma potential fluctuations with charged particle densities instead of
   the quasineutral approximation. A general dimensionless dispersion
   relation is obtained from the linearized transport equations, where the
   ratios between the characteristic velocities, as the dust ion acoustic
   (IA), dust acoustic (DA), ion sound, and thermal speeds permits us to
   evaluate the weight of the different terms. In the long wavelength limit
   the results obtained using the quasineutral approximation are recovered.
   The differences found between roots of both dispersion equations are
   discussed, as well as those of previous models. The unstable mode of the
   linear ionization instability is originated by the imbalance between ion
   and electron densities in the rest state caused by the negative charging
   of dust grains. Contrary to dust free plasmas, the unstable mode exists,
   even in the absence of the ionizing electron beam. The numerical
   calculations of the roots of the full dispersion equation present a
   maximum unstable wavenumber not predicted by the quasineutral
   approximation, which is related with the minimum allowed length for
   space charge fluctuations within a fluid model. This upper limit of
   unstable wave numbers hinders the predicted resonant coupling in the
   long wavenumber regime between the DA and DIA waves. (c) 2006 American

Pages = {{1154-1161}},
Abstract = {{We have investigated electrostatic and surface features of an essential
   region of the catalytic core of the spliceosome, the eukaryotic
   precursor messenger (pre-m) RNA splicing apparatus. The nucleophile for
   the first of two splicing reactions is the 2'-hydroxyl ( OH) of the
   ribose of a specific adenosine within the intron. During assembly of the
   spliceosome's catalytic core, this adenosine is positioned by pairing
   with a short region of the U2 small nuclear (sn) RNA to form the
   pre-mRNA branch site helix. The solution structure of the spliceosomal
   pre-mRNA branch site {[}Newby,M.I. and Greenbaum,N.L. (2002) Nature
   Struct. Biol., 9, 958 - 965] showed that a phylogenetically conserved
   pseudouridine (Psi) residue in the segment of U2 snRNA that pairs with
   the intron induces a markedly different structure compared with that of
   its unmodified counterpart. In order to achieve a more detailed
   understanding of the factors that contribute to recognition of the
   spliceosome's branch site helix and activation of the nucleophile for
   the first step of pre-mRNA splicing, we have calculated surface areas
   and electrostatic potentials of Psi-modified and unmodified branch site
   duplexes. There was no significant difference between the total
   accessible area or ratio of total polar: nonpolar groups between
   modified and unmodified duplexes. However, there was substantially
   greater exposure of nonpolar area of the adenine base, and less exposure
   of the 2'-OH, in the Psi-modified structure. Electrostatic potentials
   computed using a hybrid boundary element and finite difference nonlinear
   Poisson-Boltzmann approach {[}Boschitsch, A. H. and Fenley, M.O. (2004)
   J. Comput. Chem., 25, 935 955] revealed a region of exceptionally
   negative potential in the major groove surrounding the 2'-OH of the
   branch site adenosine. These surface and electrostatic features may
   contribute to the overall recognition of the pre-mRNA branch site region
   by other components of the splicing reaction.}},

   The characteristics of wave propagation for the considered class of

Journal = {{BIOELECTROMAGNETICS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{We developed a new computer wire coding method and then applied it to
   investigate the suggestion that control selection bias might explain the
   observed association between wire codes and childhood cancer made in the
   study conducted by Savitz et at. in the Denver area. The computer wire
   coding method used a geographic information system approach with data on
   the local distribution electric system and from tax assessor records.
   Individual residences were represented as a circle scaled to the ground
   floor area of the residence and centered on the lot centroid. The wire
   code of thr residence was determined from the distance between the
   circle and the relevant power line, and from the current carrying
   capacity of that line. Using this method, wire codes were generated for
   238 290 residences built before 1986, the time of the Savitz et al.
   study, in the Denver metropolitan area. We then attempted to reconstruct
   the 1985 population of hypothetically eligible control children in the
   Denver metropolitan area by using 1980 census data. Since data were not
   available to locate the children in each residence within a census
   block, uniform, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions were used
   to randomly assign children to residences. To evaluate the Likelihood of
   the wire code distribution of the controls selected by Savitz et al.,
   100 random trials were conducted for each distribution, matching two
   controls to each case. The odds ratios between childhood cancer and very
   high current configuration (VHCC) wire codes were reduced when the
   assigned controls were used, suggesting control selection bias may have
   been present. However, control selection bias is unlikely to account for
   all the reported association between childhood cancer and wire codes in
   the Savitz et al, study. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aimed to investigate the influence of depressive
   and anxiety symptoms in young mothers on their perception in relation to
   their children's oral health-related quality of life (COHRQoL).
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in Pelotas, Southern
   Brazil, and it was nested in a cohort of adolescent mothers having their
   prenatal care in public health service, starting in 2008. When the
   children were aged 24-36 months, they and their mothers were interviewed
   and submitted to clinical examination by a trained team. Socioeconomic,
   educational, behavioural and psychological assessments were collected in
   the interview and oral examination investigated caries and gingival
   bleeding (in mothers) and caries and dental trauma (in children).
   Maternal perception of impact on COHRQoL was evaluated by Early
   Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS). The outcome in the present
   study was the occurrence of impact on COHRQoL (ECOHIS >= 2), that is the
   presence of at least one ECOHIS item reported as occasionally (score 2),
   often (score 3) or very often (score 4). Analysis was conducted using
   Poisson regression with robust variance and obtained prevalence ratios
   (PR) and respective 95\% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results: This study comprised 537 mother-child dyads. After adjustment,
   higher scores of COHRQoL remained significantly associated with
   depressive symptoms (PR=1.80, 95\% CI: 1.36-2.38) and maternal anxiety
   symptoms (PR=2.28, 95\% CI: 1.72-3.00). Mothers with anxiety symptoms or
   depressive symptoms had a prevalence of impact 91\% higher when compared
   with mothers without any symptoms (PR=1.91; CI 95\% 1.35-2.68), and
   mothers with both symptoms had almost 2.5 times higher risk of
   perception of negative impact on COHRQoL (PR=2.48; CI 95\% 1.78-3.45).
   Conclusion: Poorer COHRQoL was associated with maternal depression and
   anxiety symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A great proportion of deaths due to traffic crashes occur
   for pedestrians, both in developing and developed countries. Objectives:
   The aim of the present study was to determine the spatial factors
   related to the frequency of traffic crashes on pedestrians in districts
   of Tehran city. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. All traffic
   crashes on pedestrians during 2013-2015 were included in this study. The
   data were extracted from different sources such as traffic police main
   office, Tehran municipal office, and Iran statistics center. Poisson and
   negative binomial regression models were used to analyze the role of
   environment and district on frequency of traffic crashes. Moreover, the
   likelihood-ratio test has been used for comparison between models, while
   assessment of goodness-of-fit has been reported using R-2, Akaike
   information criteria, and Bayesian information criteria. Results: Of
   12,090 crashes, 11,895 (98.4\%) had led to injuries, while 195 (1.6\%)
   had led to deaths. The frequency of crashes varied substantially in
   different districts of Tehran. The incidence of injuries did not show
   any particular pattern, whereas the pattern of incidence of deaths was
   lower in central districts in comparison to higher incidence in marginal
   districts (e.g., north, south, west, and east of Tehran). The results of
   the final model showed a statistically significant association among
   various variables such as demographics, web of roads, rate of traveling,
   and land use with the outcome as number of crashes in geographic units.
   Conclusions: Frequency distribution of traffic crashes leading to injury
   and/or death is completely different in various districts of Tehran.
   Demographic as well as spatial characteristics also play an important
   role in determining this distribution. Regional planning, appropriate
   traffic management, control measures on spatial risk factors, and
   educational programs could substantially improve the safety of
   pedestrians in Tehran.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Approximately 40\% of men diagnosed with metastatic prostate
   cancer experience one or more skeletal-related events (SREs), defined as
   a pathological fracture, spinal cord compression, or surgery or
   radiotherapy to the bone. Accurate assessment of their effect on
   survival, health care resource utilization (HCRU), and cost may
   elucidate the value of interventions to prevent SREs.
   Materials and Methods. Men older than age 65 years with prostate cancer
   and bone metastasis diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 were identified from
   linked Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare records.
   Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk for
   death associated with SREs were calculated by using Cox regression. HCRU
   and costs (in 2013 U.S. dollars) were evaluated in a propensity
   score-matched cohort by using Poisson regression and Kaplan-Meier sample
   average estimators, respectively.
   Results. Among 3,297 men with prostate cancer metastatic to bone, 40\%
   experienced >= 1 SRE (median follow-up, 19months). Compared with men who
   remained SRE-free, men with >= 1 SRE had a twofold higher risk for death
   (HR, 2.29; 95\% CI, 2.09-2.51). Pathological fracture was associated
   with the highest risk for death (HR, 2.77; 95\% CI, 2.38-3.23). Among
   men with >= 1 SRE, emergency department visits were twice as frequent
   (95\% CI, 1.77-2.28) and hospitalizations were nearly four times as
   frequent (95\% CI, 3.20-4.40). The attributable cost of >= 1 SRE was
   \$21,191 (>= 1 SRE: \$72,454 {[}95\% CI, \$67,362-\$76,958]; SRE-free:
   \$51,263 {[}95\% CI, \$45,439-\$56,100]).
   Conclusion. Among men with prostate cancer metastatic to bone,
   experiencing >= 1 SRE is associated with poorer survival, increased
   HCRU, and increased costs. These negative effects emphasize the
   importance of SRE prevention in this population.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Infection increases mortality in patients with
   alcoholic hepatitis (AH). Little is known about the association between
   Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and AH. We examined the prevalence
   and effects of CDI in patients with AH, compared with those of other
   infections.
   METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis using data collected
   from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, from 2008 through 2011.
   International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical
   Modification codes were used to identify patients with AH. We used
   multivariable logistic regression to determine risk factors that affect
   mortality, negative binomial regression to evaluate the effects of CDI
   on predicted length of stay (LOS), and Poisson regression to determine
   the effects of CDI on predicted hospital charges. Chi-square and
   Wilcoxon rank-sum analyses were used to compare mortality, LOS, and
   hospital charges associated with CDI with those associated with urinary
   tract infection (UTI) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
   RESULTS: Of 10,939 patients with AH, 177 had CDI (1.62\%). Patients with
   AH and CDI had increased odds of inpatient mortality (adjusted odds
   ratio, 1.75; P=.04), a longer predicted LOS (10.63 vs 5.75 d; P<.001),
   and greater predicted hospital charges (\$36,924.30 vs \$29,136.58;
   P<.001), compared with those without CDI. Compared with UTI, CDI was
   associated with similar mortality but greater LOS (9 vs 6 d; P<.001) and
   hospital charges (\$45,607 vs \$32,087; P<.001). SBP was associated with
   higher mortality than CDI (17.3\% vs 10.1\%; P=.045), but similar LOS
   and hospital charges.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AH, CDI is associated with greater
   mortality and health care use. These effects appear similar to those for
   UTI and SBP. We propose further studies to determine the cost
   effectiveness of screening for CDI among patients with AH.}},

Title = {{Temporal trends in educational inequalities in non-communicable diseases

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Socioeconomic inequalities in non-communicable diseases are known to
   exist; however there is a paucity of research describing the secular
   trends in these inequalities. To this end, the current study aims to
   explore the recent time trends in social patterning of selected
   non-communicable diseases among Korean adults between 2007 and 2015.
   Methods
   Using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey (KNHANES), temporal trends in socioeconomic inequalities in
   diabetes, arthritis, asthma and depressive symptoms were assessed across
   three time points. Respondents were adults aged 20 years or over (N =
   47,091, 20,180 men and 26,911 women). Socioeconomic circumstance was
   assessed based on highest level of educational attainment. We estimated
   prevalence ratios with 95\% confidence intervals using Poisson
   regression with robust variance estimation (adjusted for age, smoking
   status, alcohol consumption, obesity, and physical activity) separately
   for men and women. The magnitude of the inequalities was computed using
   the relative index of inequality (RII).
   Results
   In men, diabetes was not associated with educational attainment, while
   there was evidence of a negative association in women across surveys.
   Similar inverse associations were found with arthritis and depressive
   symptoms, but these associations were less clear for asthma. RII showed
   a non-significant increasing trend in educational disparities in
   depressive symptoms. Meanwhile, relative inequalities in diabetes,
   arthritis and asthma have narrowed. These trends were, in general, more
   pronounced in women.
   Conclusions
   The findings of this study indicate higher burden of selected NCDs among
   the lower educational groups, particularly among women. In addition, our
   results indicated some improvements in inequalities in diabetes,
   arthritis and asthma in recent years. These findings have important
   implications for understanding the causes of social patterning of NCDs
   and for the targeting of effective interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Immune system perturbations are involved in pre-eclampsia
   pathophysiology. We hypothesised that immunomodulating substances, such
   as mycotoxins, endotoxins or pesticides, affect pre-eclampsia risk.
   Associations between indicators of immunomodulating exposures in
   agriculture and pre-eclampsia are reported.
   In a Norwegian family cohort based on participants in agricultural
   censuses conducted by Statistics Norway 1969-89, 183 313 pregnancies to
   farmers were identified in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Cases
   notified as pre-eclampsia as well as pregnancies indicated by
   hypertension in combination with proteinuria were included. Data on farm
   production and meteorologically based fungal forecasts 1973-90 (a marker
   of temperate and humid climatic conditions known to favour fungal growth
   and mycotoxin formation in grain) were obtained and allocated to each
   farm. Pre-eclampsia prevalence rates were studied in strata of exposure
   indicators using Poisson regression models. Adjusted rate ratios (RR)
   and 95\% confidence intervals {[}CI] were computed.
   We identified 4912 cases, equivalent to 26.8 pre-eclampsia cases per
   1000 pregnancies {[}95\% CI 26.1, 27.6]. Pre-eclampsia showed moderate
   associations with animal farming, RR 1.14, {[}95\% CI 1.07, 1.22] and
   moderate negative associations with grain production, RR 0.93, {[}95\%
   CI 0.86, 1.01], and two or more fungal forecasts appearing in any year
   1973-90, RR 0.90 {[}95\% CI 0.84, 0.97], using no years with two or more
   forecasts as reference.
   Exposure to immunomodulating substances as indicated by grain farming,
   animal farming and fungal warnings could possibly have moderate effects
   on pre-eclampsia risk, thus supporting the study hypothesis. The use of
   exposure indicators as surrogates for real exposures may introduce a
   non-differential misclassification of the exposure that would attenuate
   any true exposure-outcome association. The use of exposure proxies
   warrants that inferences from the study should be made with caution.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aimed to estimate the association between
   second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure in children and asthma, wheezing and
   perceived health.
   Method: A cross-sectional study based on a telephone survey was
   performed on a representative sample of 2411 children under 12 years old
   in Spain. Exposure to SHS in private and public settings, and the
   prevalence of asthma, wheezing and perceived poor health were described.
   The association between health indicators and SHS exposure was analyzed
   using multivariate Poisson regression models with robust variance
   according to age and educational level.
   Results: The prevalence of SHS exposure in children was 29.2\% in
   private settings and 42.5\% in public settings. There was no association
   between SHS exposure and asthma, wheezing and perceived poor health in
   children <= 5 years. In children aged 6-11 years with parents with
   primary/secondary education, presenting asthma (adjusted prevalence
   ratio {[}aPR]: 2.1; 95\% confidence interval {[}95\%CI]: 1.2-3.8) and
   worse perceived health (aPR: 1.6; 95\%CI: 1.1-2.1) were positively
   associated with SHS exposure in private settings. In children with
   parents with university studies, a negative association between SHS
   exposure and asthma (aPR: .3; 95\%CI: 0.1-0.7) and wheezing (aPR: 0.3;
   95\%CI: 0.1-0.8) was observed.
   Conclusions: There are differences in the association between SHS
   exposure and asthma, wheezing and poor perceived health according to
   educational level. Interventions with an equity perspective aimed at
   reducing SHS exposure in childhood should be implemented. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of shift
   work and long working hours in midlife on the risk of dementia in old
   age.
   Methods The present study comprised 4766 participants from the
   Copenhagen Male Study. We used information on shift work (collected in
   1970-1971 and 1985-1986), long working hours defined as >45 hours per
   week (collected in 1970-1971), socioeconomic status, sleep, stress, and
   cardiovascular risk factors. Information about dementia diagnoses was
   obtained from registers. Participants were followed until 2014 (mean
   length of follow-up was 17.8 years). We employed Poisson regression for
   the survival analyses and estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) and
   their 95\% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results We found no statistically significant association between shift
   work (IRR 0.86, 95\% CI 0.70-1.05) or long working hours (IRR 0.97, 95\%
   CI 0.79-1.19) and dementia. Adjustment for potential confounders and
   mediators did not change the estimates. Working shifts at both time
   points of exposure assessment was not associated with a higher incidence
   of dementia compared with non-shift workers at both time points (IRR
   0.99, 95\% CI 0.69-1.42). The lowest incidence of dementia was observed
   among participants who reported shift work at one time point (only in
   1985-1986: IRR 0.44, 95\% CI 0.16-1.23 and only in 1970-1971: IRR 0.58,
   95\% CI 0.31-1.11).
   Conclusion We did not find positive evidence of an association between
   shift work or long working hours and the incidence of dementia, but the
   negative findings may reflect the crude assessment of shift work and
   long working hours, which is a major limitation of the present study.}},

Title = {{Impact of Rapid Molecular Screening at Hospital Admission on Nosocomial
   Transmission of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus: Cluster
   Randomised Trial}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Design: Cluster randomised crossover trial with seven wards randomly
   allocated to intervention or control arm.
   Setting: Medical and surgical wards of a university hospital with active
   MRSA control programme.
   Participants: All patients hospitalized >48 h in study wards and
   screened for MRSA on admission and discharge Intervention: Rapid
   PCR-based screening test for MRSA compared with control screening test
   by enrichment culture using chromogenic agar.
   Objective: We determined the benefit of PCR-detection versus
   culture-based detection of MRSA colonisation upon patient admission on
   early implementation of isolation precautions and reduction of hospital
   transmission of MRSA.
   Main outcome: Cumulative rate of MRSA hospital acquisition of in
   patients screened negative on admission.
   Randomization: The sequential order of inclusion of study wards in each
   arm was randomised by assigning a number to each ward and using a
   computer generated list of random numbers.
   Findings: Of 3704 eligible patients, 67.8\% were evaluable for the
   study. Compared with culture, PCR-screening reduced the median test
   reporting time from admission from 88 to 11 hours (p < 0.001) and the
   median time from admission to isolation from 96 to 25 hours (p < 0.001).
   MRSA acquisition was detected in 36 patients (3.2\%) in the control arm
   and 34 (3.2\%) in the intervention arm. The incidence density rate of
   hospital acquired MRSA was 2.82 and 2.57/1,000 exposed patient-days in
   the control and intervention arm, respectively (risk ratio 0.91 (95\%
   confidence interval, 0.60-1.39). Poisson regression model adjusted for
   colonisation pressure, compliance with hand hygiene and antibiotic use
   indicated a RR 0.99 (95\% CI, 0.69 to 1.44).
   Interpretation: Universal PCR screening for MRSA on admission to medical
   and surgical wards in an endemic setting shortened the time to implement
   isolation precautions but did not reduce nosocomial acquisition of MRSA.

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine (trends in) HIV incidence among
   MSM\textbackslash{} who have recently had postexposure prophylaxis (PEP)
   prescribed in Amsterdam, compared with MSM participating in the
   Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS).
   Design and methods: We used data from MSM who were prescribed PEP in
   Amsterdam between 2000 and 2009, who were HIV-negative at the time of
   PEP prescription and had follow-up HIV testing 3 and/or 6 months after
   PEP prescription (n = 395). For comparison, cohort data from MSM
   participating in the ACS in the same period were used (n 782). Poisson
   log-linear regression analyses were performed to model trends in HIV
   incidence and identify differences in HIV incidence between both cohorts
   at different time points.
   Results: Between 2000 and 2009, among MSM who were prescribed PEP, an
   overall HIV incidence of 6.4 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.4-11.2]
   per 100 person-years was found, compared with an HIV incidence of 1.6
   (95\% CI 1.3-2.1) per 100 person-years among MSM participating in the

Abstract = {{Background. Children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
   (HSCT) are at high risk for hospital-associated bloodstream infections
   (HA-BSIs). This study aimed to describe the incidence, microbiology, and
   risk factors for HA-BSI in pediatric HSCT recipients.
   Methods. We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of
   children and adolescents (<18 years of age) who underwent HSCT over a
   20-year period (1997-2016). We determined the incidence and case
   fatality rate of HA-BSI by causative organism. We used multivariable
   Poisson regression to identify risk factors for HA-BSI.
   Results. Of 1294 patients, the majority (86\%) received an allogeneic
   HSCT, most commonly with umbilical cord blood (63\%). During the initial
   HSCT hospitalization, 334 HA-BSIs occurred among 261 (20\%) patients.
   These were classified as gram-positive bacterial (46\%), gram-negative
   bacterial (24\%), fungal (12\%), mycobacterial (<1\%), or polymicrobial
   (19\%). During the study period, there was a decline in the cumulative
   incidence of HA-BSI (P = .021) and, specifically, fungal HA-BSIs (P =
   .002). In multivariable analyses, older age (incidence rate ratio
   {[}IRR], 1.03; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.01-1.06), umbilical
   cord blood donor source (vs bone marrow; IRR, 1.69; 95\% CI, 1.19-2.40),
   and nonmyeloablative conditioning (vs myeloablative; IRR, 1.85; 95\% CI,
   1.21-2.82) were associated with a higher risk of HA-BSIs. The case
   fatality rate was higher for fungal HA-BSI than other HA-BSI categories
   (21\% vs 6\%; P = .002).
   Conclusions. Over the past 2 decades, the incidence of HA-BSIs has
   declined among pediatric HSCT recipients at our institution. Older age,
   umbilical cord blood donor source, and nonmyeloablative conditioning
   regimens are independent risk factors for HA-BSI among children
   undergoing HSCT.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the association of the levels of different airborne

   short-term effects of outdoor air pollution on the incidence of
   osteoporotic hip fracture in a southern European region.MethodsThis is
   an ecological retrospective cohort study based on data obtained from
   three databases. In a time-series analysis, we examined the association
   between hip fracture incidence and different outdoor air pollutants
   (sulfur dioxide (SO2), monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone
   (O-3), and particulate matter in suspension <2.5 (PM2.5) and <10-m
   (PM10) conditions by using general additive models (Poisson
   distribution). The incidence rate ratio (IRR), crude and adjusted by
   season and different weather conditions, was estimated for all
   parameters. Hip incidence was later analyzed by sex and age (under or
   over age 75) subgroups. The main outcome measure was daily hospital
   admissions due to fracture.ResultsHip fracture incidence showed
   association with SO2 (IRR 1.11 (95\% CI 1.04-1.18)), NO (IRR 1.01 (95\%
   CI 1.01-1.02)), and NO2 (IRR 1.02 (95\% CI 1.01-1.04)). For O-3 levels,
   this association was negative (IRR 0.97 (95\% CI 0.95-0.99)). The
   association persisted for SO2 and NO2 when the models were adjusted by
   season. After adjusting by season and weather conditions, the
   association persisted for NO2. When participants were stratified by age
   and sex, associations persisted only in women older than
   75years.ConclusionsA short-term association was observed with several
   indicators of air pollution on hip fracture incidence. This is the first
   study that shows these associations.}},

Abstract = {{Background and purpose: Falls are common in people with Parkinson's
   disease (PD) but few data exist on fall-related hospitalizations in this
   group. This population-based study compared fall-related hospital
   admissions, injury rates and consequences in people with and without PD,
   and determined whether PD was an independent predictor of fall-related
   hospital length of stay.
   Methods: This was a retrospective study using probabilistic linkage of
   hospital data in people aged 65 years hospitalized for a fall between 1
   July 2005 and 31 December 2013 in New South Wales, Australia. Rates of
   hospital admissions and injuries per person admitted over the study
   period were compared between people with and without PD using Poisson or
   negative binomial regression. Multilevel linear modelling was used to
   analyse length of stay by clustering individuals and adjusting for
   possible confounders.
   Results: There were 342 265 fall-related hospital admissions in people
   aged 65 years during the study period, of which 8487 (2.5\%) were for
   people with PD. Sixty-seven per cent of fall-related PD admissions were
   associated with injury and 35\% were associated with fracture. People
   with PD had higher rate ratios for fall admissions (1.63, 95\%
   confidence interval 1.59-1.67) and injury (1.47, 95\% confidence
   interval 1.43-1.51) and longer median length of stay {[}9 (interquartile
   range 1-27) vs. 6 (interquartile range 1-20) days in people without PD;
   P < 0.001]. PD remained associated with increased length of stay after
   controlling for comorbidity, age, sex and injury (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: This study provides important benchmark data for
   hospitalizations for falls and fall injuries for older people with PD,
   which may be used to monitor the effect of fall prevention programmes.}},

Title = {{Caregivers' Health Literacy and Gaps in Children's Medicaid Enrollment:
   Findings from the Carolina Oral Health Literacy Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Recent evidence supports a link between
   caregivers' health literacy and their children's health and use of
   health services. Disruptions in children's health insurance coverage
   have been linked to poor health care and outcomes. We examined young
   children's Medicaid enrollment patterns in a well-characterized cohort
   of child/caregivers dyads and investigated the association of
   caregivers' low health literacy with the incidence of enrollment gaps.
   Methods: We relied upon Medicaid enrollment data for 1208 children (mean
   age = 19 months) enrolled in the Carolina Oral Health Literacy project
   during 2008-09. The median follow-up was 25 months. Health literacy was
   measured using the Newest Vital Sign (NVS). Analyses relied on
   descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate methods based on Poisson
   modeling.
   Findings: One-third of children experienced one or more enrollment gaps;
   most were short in duration (median = 5 months). The risk of gaps was
   inversely associated with caregivers' age, with a 2\% relative risk
   decrease for each added year. Low health literacy was associated with a
   modestly elevated risk increase {[}Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) = 1.17
   (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-1.57)] for enrollment disruptions;
   however, this estimate was substantially elevated among caregivers with
   less than a high school education {[}IRR = 1.52 (95\% CI 0.99-2.35);
   homogeneity p<0.2].
   Conclusions: Our findings provide initial support for a possible role of
   caregivers' health literacy as a determinant of children's Medicaid
   enrollment gaps. Although the association between health literacy and
   enrollment gaps was not confirmed statistically, we found that it was
   markedly stronger among caregivers with low educational attainment. This
   population, as well as young caregivers, may be the most vulnerable to
   the negative effects of low health literacy.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To analyze the association between chronic hepatitis C virus
   (HCV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections with type 2 diabetes in
   HIV-infected patients.
   Methods: HIV-1-infected patients enrolled in ICONA, a prospective cohort
   study involving 42 tertiary care centers in Italy, were selected with
   the following characteristics: for the diabetes incidence analysis, all
   patients with available CMV IgG results (first available test =
   baseline) and without type 2 diabetes were followed until onset of type
   2 diabetes, last available clinical follow-up, death or September 30,
   2014, whichever occurred first; for the prevalence analysis, all ICONA
   patients were analyzed at their last follow-up visit. Main outcome
   measures were the new onset of type 2 diabetes (incidence analysis) and
   the prevalence of type 2 diabetes at last follow-up.
   Results: During 38,062 person-years of follow-up (PYFU) in 6505
   individuals, we observed 140 cases of incident type 2 diabetes
   (Incidence rate 3.7, 95\% CI: 3.1 to 4.3, per 1000 PYFU). In a
   multivariable Poisson regression model, HCV-antibody (Ab) +/HCV RNA+
   patients {[}adjusted relative rate versus HCV-Ab negative 1.73 (95\% CI:
   1.08 to 2.78)] but not HCV Ab+RNA- or CMV IgG+ patients, had a higher
   risk of diabetes. Among 12,001 patients, 306 (2.5\%) prevalent cases of
   type 2 diabetes were detected. HCV Ab+RNA+ status was independently
   associated with prevalent diabetes (adjusted Odds Ratio vs HCV Ab- 2.49;
   95\% CI: 1.08 to 5.74), whereas HCV-Ab+/HCV RNA- and CMV IgG+ status
   were not.
   Conclusion: In HIV-infected individuals, active HCV replication but not
   prior HCV exposure or latent CMV infection is associated with incident
   and prevalent type 2 diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials are rationally designed man-made structures composed of
   functional building blocks that are densely packed into an effective
   (crystalline) material. While metamaterials are mostly associated with
   negative refractive indices and invisibility cloaking in
   electromagnetism or optics, the deceptively simple metamaterial concept
   also applies to rather different areas such as thermodynamics, classical
   mechanics (including elastostatics, acoustics, fluid dynamics and
   elastodynamics), and, in principle, also to quantum mechanics. We review
   the basic concepts, analogies and differences to electromagnetism, and
   give an overview on the current state of the art regarding theory and
   experiment-all from the viewpoint of an experimentalist. This review
   includes homogeneous metamaterials as well as intentionally
   inhomogeneous metamaterial architectures designed by
   coordinate-transformation-based approaches analogous to transformation
   optics. Examples are laminates, transient thermal cloaks, thermal
   concentrators and inverters, `space-coiling' metamaterials, anisotropic
   acoustic metamaterials, acoustic free-space and carpet cloaks, cloaks
   for gravitational surface waves, auxetic mechanical metamaterials,
   pentamode metamaterials ('meta-liquids'), mechanical metamaterials with
   negative dynamic mass density, negative dynamic bulk modulus, or
   negative phase velocity, seismic metamaterials, cloaks for flexural
   waves in thin plates and three-dimensional elastostatic cloaks.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Uganda has an unmet need for family planning of 34\% and a
   total fertility rate of 6.2. We assessed the desire for female
   sterilization among sexually active women who wanted to stop
   childbearing in rural Rakai district, Uganda.
   Study design: 7192 sexually active women enrolled in a community cohort
   between 2002 and 2008 were asked about fertility intentions. Those
   stating that they did not want another child (limiters) were asked
   whether they would be willing to accept female sterilization, if
   available. Trends in desire for sterilization were determined by
   chi-square test for trend, and Modified Poisson regression was used to
   estimate prevalence rate ratios and 95\% confidence intervals of the
   associations between desire for sterilization and socio-demographic
   characteristics and HIV status.
   Results: From 2002 to 2008, the proportion of limiters dropped (from
   47.2\% to 43.7\%; p<.01). Use of pills and injectables among limiters
   significantly increased, 38.9\% to 50.3\% (p<.0001), while use of
   intrauterine devices and implants declined from 3.3\% to 1.7\%
   (p<0.001). The desire for sterilization significantly increased from
   54.2\% to 63.1\% (p<0.0001), and this was consistently higher among the
   HIV-positive (63.6-70.9\%, p<0.01) than HIV-negative women (53.3-61.2\%,
   p<0.0001). Factors significantly associated with the desire for
   sterilization included higher number of living children (> = 3), being
   HIV-infected and having received HIV counseling and testing.
   Conclusion: There is latent and growing desire for sterilization in this
   population. Our findings suggest a need to increase permanent
   contraception services for women who want to limit childbearing in this
   setting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundRelapse is common in patients with alcohol dependence, even
   after detoxification. The aims of this prospective study were to
   investigate changes affecting patients during the first 6months after
   discharge from hospitalization for detoxification and to determine the
   influence of these changes on the likelihood of alcohol-related
   emergency room (ER) visits in the following 18-month period.
   MethodsThe study included 88 patients hospitalized for participation in
   a detoxification program in the addiction department of a university
   hospital in Rennes, France. Alcohol consumption, psychiatric symptoms,
   and life events were investigated by addiction specialists during
   hospitalization and 6months afterward. For each patient, the number of
   alcohol-related ER visits in the last 6months was prospectively recorded
   at the hospital 12, 18, and 24months after hospitalization. The rate
   ratios of ER visits as a function of sociodemographic variables and
   changes observed 6months after discharge were estimated using Poisson
   regression with autoregressive errors.
   ResultsNearly half of the patients (47.7\%) had ER visits in the 12- to
   24-month period following discharge. The likelihood of ER visits was
   higher for patients living with friends/parents and for those with
   aggravated psychiatric symptoms, negative changes in their family life,
   and who had a medical follow-up in the 6months after discharge. In
   contrast, the likelihood of ER visits was lower for patients living with
   children and those with improved psychiatric morbidity. Alcohol
   consumption and psychiatric symptoms at baseline had no significant
   effect.
   ConclusionsMonitoring changes in psychiatric symptoms and family life
   early after a detoxification program may help identify patients who are
   vulnerable to relapse in the subsequent 18-month period. Systematic
   screening for these changes as early as possible, in combination with
   appropriate treatment and the establishment of a social support system,
   could be fundamental in avoiding further relapses and ER visits.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of Human Immunodeficiency
   Virus (HIV)-assisted smartphone applications in the treatment of
   HIV/AIDS patients in Vietnam. A cross-sectional study was performed in
   two urban outpatient clinics in Hanoi from May to December 2019. A
   simple random sampling method and a structured questionnaire were used
   to recruit 495 eligible participants and to collect data. Multivariable
   modified Poisson regression and multivariable linear regression models
   were employed to investigate the factors associated with the willingness
   to pay (WTP) and amount of money patients were willing to pay.
   Approximately 82.8\% of respondents were willing to pay for the
   hypothetical applications, with the mean amount the participants were
   willing to pay of Vietnam Dong (VND) 72,100/month. Marital status
   (separate/divorced/widow: Odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) = (1.09; 1.50) and having spouse/partner: OR = 1.18, 95\%
   CI = (1.03; 1.36)) and using health services (OR = 1.03, 95\% CI =
   (1.01; 1.04)) were positively associated with nominating they would be
   WTP for the app, whereas the duration of antiretroviral treatment (ART)
   (OR = 0.98, 95\% CI = (0.96; 0.99)) had a negative association. The
   frequency of using health services (beta = 0.04, 95\% CI = (-0.07;
   -0.01)) was negatively associated with the amount of WTP. High levels of
   WTP revealed the feasibility of implementing smartphone-based apps for
   HIV treatment. This study implied the necessity to consider a co-payment
   system to reach populations who were in need but where such applications
   may be unaffordable in lieu of other treatment-associated expenses.
   Developers also need to pay attention to privacy features to attract
   single people living with HIV/AIDS and additional measures to initiate
   people with a long duration on ART into using the applications.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Weight stigmatization during adolescence may compromise the
   development of social relations important for the development. This
   study examined the associations between weight status and likelihood of
   nomination (indegree) for five different social network
   typesdfriendship, romantic, admiration, succeed, and popularity.
   Methods: Data for the study were from 1,110 tenth grade students (aged
   11-19 years) from four high schools in one Los Angeles school district
   in 2010. Multiple Poisson regression analyses using generalized linear
   model were conducted to examine the relationship between weight status
   (underweight/normal weight/overweight measured with body mass index
   calculated from self-reported height and weight) and adolescents'
   indegree for the five different networks.
   Results: Obese adolescents were significantly less likely to be
   nominated as romantic interest (odds ratio {[}OR]:.29, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]:.19-42), admired (OR:.80, 95\% CI:.65-.97), or popular
   (OR:.71, 95\% CI:.57-88) compared with their normal weight peers.
   Overweight adolescents were also less likely to be nominated as a
   romantic interest (OR:.57, 95\% CI:.42-.78) or popular (OR:.67, 95\%
   CI:.53-.84) compared with those who were normal weight. Underweight
   adolescents were also less likely to be nominated as friends (OR:.76,
   95\% CI:.60e98), someone admired (OR:.61, 95\% CI:.42-.89), likely to
   succeed (OR:.62, 95\% CI:.44-.87), or popular (OR:.40, 95\% CI:.25-.64).
   Conclusions: Our results suggest weight status is associated with being
   selected by peers into different types of adolescent networks.
   Underweight, overweight, and obese adolescents are at an increased risk
   for social isolation because of their weight. This may have a negative
   impact on their peer relations important for social development,
   self-esteem, and mental health. (C) 2020 Society for Adolescent Health

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A detailed structural, spectroscopic, mechanical and thermodynamic
   characterization of the bismuth uranyloxide hydroxy-hydrate mineral
   uranosphaerite, Bi(UO2)O2OH, is obtained using the X-ray diffraction and
   infrared and Raman spectroscopic techniques and first principles
   solid-state methods based on density functional theory employing plane
   wave basis sets and pseudopotentials. The full crystal structure of
   uranosphaerite, including the positions of the hydrogen atoms within the
   corresponding unit cell, is determined by the first time from X-ray
   diffraction data taken from a natural crystal sample from Menzenschwand
   uranium deposit (Germany). The crystal structure obtained from X-ray
   diffraction is confirmed by using the first principles methodology. The
   computed structural parameters and X-ray diffraction pattern are in
   excellent agreement with their experimental counterparts. From the
   energy-optimized crystal structure, the mechanical and dynamical
   stability of uranosphaerite is studied and a rich set of mechanical
   properties are determined. Uranosphaerite is shown to display the
   negative Poisson's ratio phenomenon. The experimental infrared spectrum
   is recorded from a natural sample from Schneeberg (Germany) and the
   Raman spectrum is collected from two crystal samples from Hagendorf and
   Schneeberg localities (Germany). Both spectra are also determined using
   density functional perturbation theory and compared with the observed
   spectra. Since the computed and experimental spectra have a very high
   degree of consistence, the infrared and Raman bands are completely
   assigned using a normal coordinate analysis of the theoretical
   vibrational results. The spectral zone from 1000 to 3000 cm(-1) in the
   infrared and Raman spectra is shown to be plagued of low intensity
   combination bands. Eleven and eight combination bands are identified in
   the infrared and Raman spectra, respectively. The fundamental
   thermodynamic functions of uranosphaerite are computed as a function of
   temperature using phonon calculations. The computed specific heat and
   entropy at 298.15 K are 147.7 and 180.4 J.K-1.mol(-1), respectively. The
   computed thermodynamic parameters are used to determine the
   corresponding thermodynamic properties of formation in terms of the
   elements as a function of temperature and the Gibbs free energies of
   reaction of a series of reactions involving uranosphaerite and a
   representative subset of the most important secondary phases of spent
   nuclear fuel. The relative stability of uranosphaerite with respect to
   these phases as a function of temperature and under different
   concentrations of hydrogen peroxide is reported.}},

Abstract = {{An increase in the daily rate of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has
   been observed during days of geomagnetic storm (GS). However, the
   analysis of associations between the daily number of AMI and geomagnetic
   activity (GMA) over longer periods sometimes yields controversial
   results. The study aimed to detect the complex association between the
   daily numbers of AMI and weather, the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO)
   phase, GMA, and solar wind variables. We used data of Kaunas
   population-based Ischemic Heart Disease Register of residents of Kaunas
   city (Lithuania) for 2000-2012. The associations between weather and
   space weather variables and the daily number of AMI were evaluated by
   applying the multivariate Poisson regression. A higher risk of AMI was
   positively associated with active-stormy local GMA (rate ratio (RR) =
   1.06 (95\% CI 1.01-1.10)), solar wind dynamic pressure with a lag of 4
   days (RR = 1.02 (1.01-1.04) per 1 nPa increase), and solar wind speed
   with a lag of 3-7 days (RR = 1.03 (1.01-1.05) per 100 km/s increase). A
   positive association was found between the west QBO phase and the risk
   of AMI during winter (RR = 1.08 (1.01-1.16)), and a negative association
   was observed between them during March-November (RR = 0.93 (0.90-0.97)).
   The risk of AMI positively associated with the GS due to stream
   interaction regions with a lag of 0-2 days during the east QBO phase (RR
   = 1.10, p = 0.046) and was negatively associated with them during the
   west QBO phase (RR = 0.82, p = 0.024). These results may help understand
   the population's sensitivity under different weather and space weather
   conditions. The QBO phase may modify the effect of GS.}},

Title = {{Reduced Lower Extremity Functioning Is Associated With an Increased Rate
   of Being a Nondriver: The National Health and Aging Trends Study}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL THERAPY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{99}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background Driving a motor vehicle is an important aspect of mobility
   for older adults. Limited lower extremity functioning performance, as
   measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), has been
   associated with various negative health outcomes, but little is known
   about the association of SPPB scores with driving status.
   Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether lower
   (poorer) SPPB scores are associated with an increased rate for being a
   current nondriver among a nationally representative sample of
   community-dwelling older adults.
   Design The National Health and Aging Trends Study is a longitudinal
   cohort study.
   Methods A population of 5935 participants, surveyed annually from 2011
   to 2014 for the National Health and Aging Trends Study, was used to
   examine the relationship between SPPB and driving status. Using weighted
   data, multivariable Poisson regression with generalized estimating
   equations was used to calculate the rate ratios, adjusting for
   covariates and clustering due to the complex survey design.
   Results Participants with a low (poor) SPPB score (0-5) had a rate for
   being a current nondriver 2.01 times the rate (or 101\% increase) of
   those with a high (good) SPPB score (10-12) (adjusted 95\% confidence
   interval = 1.78-2.26).
   Limitations Current nondrivers were not asked whether they planned to
   resume driving if they had not driven in the previous year.
   Conclusions Unlike other factors, such as cognitive decline, lower SPPB
   scores (poorer lower extremity functioning) are significantly associated
   with an increased rate of being a current nondriver and are a modifiable
   risk factor. Further research is needed to examine whether optimum
   exercises and other physical therapist interventions focused on
   improving lower extremity strength and balance ultimately improve
   driving outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Benzene is a known occupational carcinogen associated with
   increased risk of hematologic cancers, but the relationships between
   quantity of passive benzene exposure through residential proximity to
   toxic release sites, duration of exposure, lag time from exposure to
   cancer development, and lymphoma risk remain unclear.
   Methods: We collected release data through the Environmental Protection
   Agency's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) from 1989 to 2003, which
   included location of benzene release sites, years when release occurred,
   and amount of release. We also collected data on incident cases of
   non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) from the Georgia Comprehensive Cancer
   Registry (GCCR) for the years 1999-2008. We constructed distance-decay
   surrogate exposure metrics and Poisson and negative binomial regression
   models of NHL incidence to quantify associations between passive
   exposure to benzene and NHL risk and examined the impact of amount,
   duration of exposure, and lag time on cancer development. Akaike's
   information criteria (AIC) were used to determine the scaling factors
   for benzene dispersion and exposure periods that best predicted NHL
   risk.
   Results: Using a range of scaling factors and exposure periods, we found
   that increased levels of passive benzene exposure were associated with
   higher risk of NHL. The best fitting model, with a scaling factor of 4
   kilometers (km) and exposure period of 1989-1993, showed that higher
   exposure levels were associated with increased NHL risk (Level 4
   (1.1-160 kilograms (kg)) vs. Level 1: risk ratio 1.56 {[}1.44-1.68],
   Level 5 (>160 kg) vs. Level 1: 1.60 {[}1.48-1.74]).
   Conclusions: Higher levels of passive benzene exposure are associated
   with increased NHL risk across various lag periods. Additional
   epidemiological studies are needed to refine these models and better
   quantify the expected total passive benzene exposure in areas
   surrounding release sites. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Aims: To assess reports of dental pain in a school-based sample of
   children in South Brazil and test its association with socioeconomic,
   demographic, psychosocial, and clinical variables. Also, the
   consequences of dental pain on oral health perception and its impact on
   daily life were investigated. Methods: A two-stage cluster procedure was
   used to select 1,199 children in 20 public and private schools in
   Pelotas, Brazil. Children were interviewed to obtain self-reports of
   dental pain. They were also asked about perception of their oral health
   and dental fear. Mothers answered a questionnaire on socioeconomic
   characteristics. A clinical oral examination was conducted to assess
   dental caries, malocclusion, and dental trauma. Multivariate Poisson
   regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated with
   dental pain in the previous 6 months and its effect on oral health
   perception. Results: The prevalence of dental pain was 35.7\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 33.0-38.5) in the previous 6 months. A higher
   prevalence of dental pain was observed for children from lower-income
   families (prevalence ratio {[}PR] 1.39; 95\% CI 1.10-1.76), for girls
   (PR 1.24; 95\% CI 1.06-1.46), for those living in overcrowded houses (PR
   1.23; 95\% CI 1.01-1.49), for those who reported dental fear (PR 1.19;
   95\% CI 1.00-1.42), and for those with caries experience (PR 1.57; 95\%
   CI 1.34-1.84), after adjustments. Dental pain presence influenced oral
   health perception (PR 2.56; 95\% CI 1.55-3.29) and impacted the
   children's daily life (PR 1.89; 95\% CI 1.64-2.17). Conclusion: A high
   percentage of schoolchildren suffered from dental pain, which was
   influenced by demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and clinical

Abstract = {{Breakfast skipping is a potentially modifiable behavior that has
   negative effects on health and is socioeconomically patterned. This
   study aimed to examine the intrapersonal (health, behavioral, and
   cognitive) and social factors associated with breakfast skipping.
   Nonpregnant women (n = 4123) aged 18-45 y from socioeconomically
   disadvantaged neighborhoods throughout Victoria, Australia, completed a
   postal questionnaire. Sociodemographic characteristics, diet, physical
   activity, sedentary behaviors, and cognitive and social factors were
   assessed by self-report. Breakfast skipping was defined in 2 ways: 1)
   ``rarely/never{''} eating breakfast (n = 498) and 2) eating breakfast <=
   2 d/wk (includes those who rarely/never ate breakfast; n = 865). Poisson
   regression was used to calculate prevalence ratios and linear trends,
   adjusting for covariates. The P values for linear trends are reported
   below. Compared with breakfast consumers, women who reported
   rarely/never eating breakfast tended to have poorer self-rated health
   (P-trend < 0.001), be current smokers (P-trend < 0.001), pay less
   attention to health (P-trend < 0.001), not prioritize their own healthy
   eating when busy looking after their family (P-trend < 0.001), have less
   nutrition knowledge (P-trend < 0.001), and a lower proportion were
   trying to control their weight (P-trend < 0.020). When breakfast
   skipping was defined as eating breakfast d/wk, additional associations
   were found for having lower leisure-time physical activity (P-trend =
   0.012) and less self-efficacy for eating a healthy diet (P-trend <
   0.043). In conclusion, a range of intrapersonal and social factors were
   significantly associated with breakfast skipping among women living in
   socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. Acknowledging the cross-sectional
   design and need for causal confirmation, programs that aim to promote
   breakfast consumption in this population group should consider targeting
   family-related barriers to healthy eating and nutrition knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{This article details steps in creating low-power artificial muscles
   using 3D printing. It describes a manufacturing system that can be used
   to fabricate seamless tubular dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA), for
   eventual use in biorobotic devices. The focus is on producing passive
   elastomeric components of DEA and the dimensional changes that occur
   after printing is complete. A four-axis printing system is described,
   capable of spray depositing multilayer tubular silicone membranes onto
   an air-permeable mandrel. Mechanical strain was imparted in the
   membranes by means of inflation. A laser measurement system was
   constructed to act as a 3D scanner, which measured the shape of the
   inflated ``balloon.'' The surface shape was reconstructed in software
   using the parametric modeling tool Grasshopper. Seamless auxetic
   tessellations were calculated across the entire surface, and then
   converted to CNC GCode. These toolpaths were then physically extruded
   over the surface of the balloon, stacked five layers high. When the
   extruded silicone structure was completely cured, the pneumatic strain
   was released, allowing the structure to collapse evenly. The compression
   in the printed structure was balanced by the tension in the stretched
   membranes, thus producing a minimum energy structure.}},

Title = {{Trigonometric comparison measure: A feature selection method for text
   categorization}},
Journal = {{DATA \& KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{1-21}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Text data represented using vector space model is high dimensional data
   since the number of words can easily grow to tens of thousands for a
   moderate sized dataset. It may contain lots of redundant or irrelevant
   features that degrade the performance of a classifier for text
   categorization. To address this problem, feature selection can be
   applied for dimensionality reduction and it aims to find a set of highly
   distinguishing features. Most of filter feature selection methods for
   text categorization are based on document frequencies in positive and
   negative classes. Considering only document frequencies favors terms
   frequently used in a larger class and ignores relative document
   frequencies in the classes. In this paper, we present a new filter
   feature selection method, named Trigonometric Comparison Measure (TCM)
   considering relative document frequencies. The proposed method utilizes
   true positive rate and false positive rate to determine a better subset
   of features for text categorization and prefers terms that appear only
   in documents of one class with high probability. In order to assign a
   higher rank to terms that are frequently used in one class and rarely
   appears in another class, TCM calculates off axis angles of a vector
   represented as (tpr, fpr) and gives a larger score to terms with a small
   angle using sin and cos functions. The proposed method is compared with
   eight well-known filter feature selection methods including balanced
   accuracy measure (ACC2), information gain (IG), chi-squared (CHI), odds
   ratio (OR), Gini index (Gini), Deviation from a Poisson distribution
   (DP), distinguishing feature selector (DFS) and normalized difference
   measure (NDM) on ten datasets using the multinomial naive Bayes and
   support vector machines. The experimental results show that TCM achieves
   significantly better performance for text categorization.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH PROMOTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{70-78}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: This study addresses the dearth of population-based research on
   how comprehensive household smoke-free rules (ie, in the home and car)
   relate to tobacco use and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure among
   adolescents. Design: Analysis of 2014 Minnesota Youth Tobacco Survey.
   Setting: Representative sample of Minnesota youth. Participants: A total
   of 1287 youth who lived with a smoker. Measures: Measures included
   household smoke-free rules (no rules, partial rules-home or car, but not
   both-and comprehensive rules), lifetime and 30-day cigarette use, 30-day
   cigarette and other product use, and SHS exposure in past 7 days in home
   and car. Analysis: Weighted multivariate logistic, zero-inflated
   Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions were used.
   Results: Compared to comprehensive rules, partial and no smoke-free
   rules were significantly and positively related to lifetime cigarette
   use (respectively, adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR] = 1.80, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = 1.24-2.61; AOR = 2.87, 95\% CI = 1.93-4.25), and a
   similar significant pattern was found for 30-day cigarette use
   (respectively, AOR = 2.20, 95\% CI = 1.21-4.02; AOR = 2.45, 95\% CI =
   1.34-4.50). No smoke-free rules significantly predicted using cigarettes
   and other tobacco products compared to comprehensive rules. In both
   descriptive and regression analyses, we found SHS exposure rates in both
   the home and car were significantly lower among youth whose household
   implemented comprehensive smoke-free rules. Conclusions: Comprehensive
   smoke-free rules protect youth from the harms of caregiver tobacco use.
   Relative to both partial and no smoke-free rules, comprehensive
   smoke-free rules have a marked impact on tobacco use and SHS exposure
   among youth who live with a smoker. Health promotion efforts should
   promote comprehensive smoke-free rules among all households and
   particularly households with children and adolescents.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{33-39}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aims: The aim of this research was to determine the association between
   legalizing medical marijuana and workplace fatalities.
   Design: Repeated cross-sectional data on workplace fatalities at the
   state-year level were analyzed using a multivariate Poisson regression.
   Setting: To date, 29 states and the District of Columbia have legalized
   the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. Although there is
   increasing concern that legalizing medical marijuana will make
   workplaces more dangerous, little is known about the relationship
   between medical marijuana laws (MMLs) and workplace fatalities.
   Participants: All 50 states and the District of Columbia for the period
   1992-2015.
   Measurements: Workplace fatalities by state and year were obtained from
   the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Regression models were adjusted for
   state demographics, the unemployment rate, state fixed effects, and year
   fixed effects.
   Findings: Legalizing medical marijuana was associated with a 19.5\%
   reduction in the expected number of workplace fatalities among workers
   aged 25-44 (incident rate ratio {[}IRR], 0.805; 95\% CI, .662.979). The
   association between legalizing medical marijuana and workplace
   fatalities among workers aged 16-24, although negative, was not
   statistically significant at conventional levels. The association
   between legalizing medical marijuana and workplace fatalities among
   workers aged 25-44 grew stronger over time. Five years after coming into
   effect, MMLs were associated with a 33.7\% reduction in the expected
   number of workplace fatalities (IRR, 0.663; 95\% CI, .482.912). MMLs
   that listed pain as a qualifying condition or allowed collective
   cultivation were associated with larger reductions in fatalities among
   workers aged 25-44 than those that did not.
   Conclusions: The results provide evidence that legalizing medical
   marijuana improved workplace safety for workers aged 25-44. Further
   investigation is required to determine whether this result is
   attributable to reductions in the consumption of alcohol and other
   substances that impair cognitive function, memory, and motor skills.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on sexual risk
   behavior and HIV transmission among HIV-infected persons in Africa is
   unknown.
   Objective: To assess changes in risky sexual behavior and estimated HIV
   transmission from HIV-infected adults after 6 months of ART.
   Design and methods: A prospective cohort study was performed in rural
   Uganda. Between May 2003 and December 2004 a total of 926 HIV-infected
   adults were enrolled and followed in a home-based ART program that
   included prevention counselling, voluntary counseling and testing (VCT)
   for cohabitating partners and condom provision. At baseline and
   follow-up, participants' HIV plasma viral load and partner-specific
   sexual behaviors were assessed. Risky sex was defined as inconsistent or
   no condom use with partners of HIV-negative or unknown serostatus in the
   previous 3 months. The rates of risky sex were compared using a Poisson
   regression model and transmission risk per partner was estimated, based
   on established viral load-specific transmission rates.
   Results: Six months after initiating ART, risky sexual behavior reduced
   by 70\% {[}adjusted risk ratio, 0.3; 95\% confidence interval (CI),
   0.2-0.7; P=0.0017]. Over 85\% of risky sexual acts occurred within
   married couples. At baseline, median viral load among those reporting
   risky sex was 122 500 copies/ml, and at follow-up, < 50 copies/ml.
   Estimated risk of HIV transmission from cohort members declined by 98\%,
   from 45.7 to 0.9 per 1000 person years.
   Conclusions: Providing ART, prevention counseling, and partner VCT was
   associated with reduced sexual risk behavior and estimated risk of HIV
   transmission among HIV-infected Ugandan adults during the first 6 months
   of therapy. integrated ART and prevention programs may reduce HIV
   transmission in Africa. (C) 2006 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}},

Abstract = {{Average maize yield in eastern Africa is 2.03 t ha(-1) as compared to
   gibbal average of 6.06 t ha(-1) due to biotic and abiotic constraints.
   Amongst the biotic production constraints in Africa, stem borers are the
   most injurious. In eastern Africa, maize yield losses due to stem borers
   are currently estimated between 12\% and 21\% of the total production.
   The objective of the present study was to explore the possibility of
   RapidEye spectral data to assess stem borer larva densities in maize
   fields in two study sites in Kenya. RapidEye images were acquired for
   the Bomet (western Kenya) test site on the 9th of December 2014 and on
   27th of January 2015, and for Machakos (eastern Kenya) a RapidEye image
   was acquired on the 3rd of January 2015. Five RapidEye spectral bands as
   well as 30 specttal vegetation indices (SVIs) were utilized to predict
   per field maize stem borer larva densities using generalized linear
   models (GLMs), assuming Poisson ('Po') and negative binomial ('NB')
   distributions. Root mean square error (RMSE) and ratio prediction to
   deviation (RPD) statistics were used to assess the Models performance
   using a leave one -out cross-validation approach. The Zero-inflated NB
   ('ZINB') models outperformed the `NB' models and stem borer larva
   densities could only be predicted during the mid growing season in
   December and early January in both study sites, respectively
   (RMSE=0.69-1.06 and RPD = 8.25-19.57). Overall, all models performed
   similar when all the 30 SVIs (non-nested) and only the significant
   (nested) SVIs were used. The models developed could improve decision
   making regarding controlling maize stem borers within integrated pest
   management (IPM) interventions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background In Greenland, the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen
   carriers, reflecting chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, is
   5\%-10\%. However, the incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular
   carcinoma in this population has been reported to be low. We
   investigated this discrepancy in a large population-based cohort study.
   Methods In total, 8879 Greenlanders (16\% of the population) were
   recruited for population-based surveys performed from May 5 to July 7,
   1987, and from November 1 to November 21, 1998, with follow-up until
   March 31, 2010. HBV status was based on serological testing,
   supplemented by data from all available HBV registries in Greenland to
   determine changes in HBV status over time. Information on morbidity and
   mortality was obtained from the Patient Discharge Registry, the Cancer
   Registry, and the Central Registration System. Sex, age, ethnicity, and
   period-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using
   Poisson regression. World standardized rates were derived from these and
   World Health Organization data.
   Results The 650 chronically HBV-infected persons had higher rates of
   hepatocellular carcinoma (adjusted IRR = 8.70; 95\% CI = 2.06 to 36.7),
   liver disease (adjusted IRR = 5.73, 95\% CI = 3.52 to 9.34), and
   all-cause mortality (adjusted IRR = 1.47; 95\% CI = 1.21 to 1.79) than
   the 5160 HBV-negative persons. However, the world standardized incidence
   rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (38.5 cancers per 100 000
   person-years) and cirrhosis (24 cases per 100 000 person-years) among
   chronically HBV-infected persons were low compared with results from
   population-based studies from countries with low, intermediate, and high
   rates of endemic HBV infection.
   Conclusion The relatively low incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and
   other HBV-related morbidity among chronic HBV-infected persons in
   Greenland suggest a more benign course of HBV among the Greenlandic
   Inuit than in populations in other parts of the world.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Gradual age-related cognitive deteriorations are common and
   are hypothesised to be partially attributable to declines in
   information-processing speed. The Iowa Healthy and Active Minds Study
   will evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of a computerised visual
   processing speed training programme (Road Tour, Posit Science
   Corporation, San Francisco, California).
   Methods and analysis: Using a 3: 3: 4: 4 ratio within two age strata
   (50-64 vs >= 65 years old), 681 men and women attending family care
   clinics were randomised to four treatment groups: 10 h of on-site Road
   Tour training, 10 h of on-site Road Tour training with 4 h of booster
   training at 11 months postrandomisation, 10 h of on-site attention
   control using computerised crossword puzzles (Boatload of Crosswords,
   Boatload Puzzles, LLC, Yorktown Heights, New York) and 10 h of at-home
   Road Tour training using the participant's personal computer. The
   primary outcome, visual processing speed, was assessed at randomisation
   and post-training (6-8 weeks postrandomisation), and is being reassessed
   at 1-year postrandomisation using the Useful Field of View test. Five
   secondary outcomes (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Trail Making Tests A
   and B, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Digit Vigilance Test, and
   the Stroop Colour and Word Test) were assessed at randomisation and will
   be reassessed at 1-year postrandomisation. Seven hypotheses will be
   tested using intent-to-treat analyses involving multiple linear,
   logistic, Poisson and negative binomial regression.
   Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was provided by the University
   of Iowa Institutional Review Board (IRB-03 protocol 200908789). All
   participants completed signed informed consent prior to enrolment. Road
   Tour is commercially available from Posit Science Corporation, which
   provided it to Iowa Healthy and Active Minds Study at no cost. All
   participants will receive a free copy of Road Tour for unlimited
   perpetual use at study completion.}},

   members of the investigative team have any conflicts of interest or
   conflicts of commitment involving Posit Science. Specifically, no one on
   the investigative team will financially profit in any way from the use
   of Road Tour in IHAMS, or in any subsequent study using Road Tour. Posit
   Science acquired ownership in October 2007 of the original speed of
   processing intervention that was used in the multisite ACTIVE RCT on
   which FDW was an original co-investigator (at the ACTIVE Indiana
   University site). The ACTIVE speed of processing intervention had been
   developed earlier by K Ball (ACTIVE site-PI at the University of
   Alabama-Birmingham) and D Roenker (at Western Kentucky University). In
   collaboration with K Ball and D Roenker, Posit Science subsequently
   developed the second-generation, value-added version of the visual speed
   of processing intervention known as Road Tour and used here in IHAMS.
   From December 2007 to March 2009, FDW had a limited, part-time
   consulting arrangement (15 days, total) with Posit Science to support
   additional analyses of the first 5 years of the ACTIVE follow-up data
   that had not been identified in the original ACTIVE protocols or funded
   by the various US NIH grants supporting ACTIVE. This arrangement was
   approved in advance by the ACTIVE Executive Committee (which included
   the US NIH project officers), and was sanctioned by the Provost of the
   University of Iowa. After terminating this limited, part-time consulting
   arrangement with Posit Science, FDW applied in April 2009 for, and was
   awarded in September 2009 the US NIH Challenge Grant known as IHAMS.
   Posit Science provided the 700 copies of Road Tour used in IHAMS at no
   cost whatsoever. Furthermore, in its letter of commitment to IHAMS and
   the US NIH, Posit Science stated should the results support the efficacy
   and effectiveness of Road Tour, they will `work with agencies at the
   federal government to make the programme available for wide-scale
   implementation at only a fraction of the current per-user cost.'}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study aimed to characterize self-rated health and to
   investigate associations between that variable and socio-demographic and
   health conditions in older men in a medium-sized Brazilian city.
   Methods: Subjects eligible for this cross-sectional study included older
   males residing in the municipality who were interviewed during the
   influenza immunisation campaign in 2006. A descriptive analysis of the
   variables was performed, exploring associations between self-rated
   health and a number of co-variables, using prevalence ratios (PR).
   Multivariate analysis used Poisson regression.
   Results: The study population consisted of 2,876 men with a mean age of
   70.01 years (standard deviation = 7.21), the majority were married and
   with low schooling. A major portion reported having a regular physician,
   using public health care services, and making regular use of medication.
   Fair to poor health was reported by nearly 40\% of these older men. In
   the bivariate analysis, different factors were associated with negative
   self-rated health, whilst in the multivariate model the following
   remained associated with fair or poor self-rated health: number of
   chronic conditions, regular use of medication (PR = 1.67, 95\%
   confidence interval (Cl) = 1.43-1.94), recent hospitalization (PR =
   1.48, 95\% Cl = 1.33-1.65), not currently working (PR = 1.34, 95\% Cl =
   1.17-1.52), low schooling (PR = 1.29, 95\% Cl = 1.13-1.48), and being a
   user of the public health care system (PR = 1.37, 95\% Cl = 1.21-1.54).
   Conclusion: These findings corroborate the hypothesis that various
   issues are related to self-rated health in the elderly. Considering that
   self-rated health is a good indicator of objective health conditions in
   this age group, health services should develop strategies to capture
   older men with a risk profile for poor self-rated health. (C) 2009 WPMH

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and
   predictive factors of catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs)
   acquired through a central venous catheter for delivery of home
   parenteral nutrition (HPN) therapy among a patient population in
   Thailand.
   Methods: This retrospective review was conducted with adult patients
   with intestinal failure who received HPN from October 2002 to April
   2014, at Ramathibodi Home Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Referral
   Center in Bangkok.
   Results: Seventy-two patients (45.8\% male, mean age 56.2 +/- 15.7 y)
   were included in the analysis. Incidence of CRBSIs was 1.47 per 1000
   catheter days. Over the 12-y period, there were 21 CRBSIs among 10
   patients. There were 26 pathogens isolated from these CRBSIs, mostly
   coagulase-negative staphylococci. Univariate Poisson regression analysis
   revealed that the incidence rate ratio of CRBSIs was significantly
   higher in patients who used an implanted port (compared with tunneled
   catheter), alcohol-based povidone-iodine solution as disinfectant
   (compared with 2\% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70\% isopropyl alcohol),
   cyclic HPN infusion (compared with continuous HPN), and hospital-based
   compound HPN formulations (compared with 3-in-1 commercial
   formulations). Furthermore, longer duration of HPN (>250 d) was
   associated with CRBSIs. Multivariate analysis revealed that longer
   duration of HPN, cyclic HPN, and hospital-based compound HPN were
   significantly associated with CRBSIs.
   Conclusions: CRBSI is a significant complication in patients receiving
   long-term HPN. Individualized therapy with a multidisciplinary team in
   centers with HPN management expertise is required. Careful selection of
   the catheter type and HPN formulation for each patient is necessary to
   best meet patient requirements and minimize HPN-related complications.
   Strict compliance by patients and caregivers with evidence-based
   instructions together with supervision by well-trained HPN providers is
   the most effective strategy to prevent CRBSIs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Increasing the value of health research in the WHO African Region beyond
   2015-reflecting on the past, celebrating the present and building the
   future: a bibliometric analysis}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the profile and determinants of health research
   productivity in Africa since the onset of the new millennium.
   Design: Bibliometric analysis.
   Data collection and synthesis: In November 2014, we searched PubMed for
   articles published between 2000 and 2014 from the WHO African Region,
   and obtained country-level indicators from World Bank data. We used
   Poisson regression to examine time trends in research publications and
   negative binomial regression to explore determinants of research
   publications.
   Results: We identified 107 662 publications, with a median of 727 per
   country (range 25-31 757). Three countries (South Africa, Nigeria and
   Kenya) contributed 52\% of the publications. The number of publications
   increased from 3623 in 2000 to 12 709 in 2014 (relative growth 251\%).
   Similarly, the per cent share of worldwide research publications per
   year increased from 0.7\% in 2000 to 1.3\% in 2014. The trend analysis
   was also significant to confirm a continuous increase in health research
   publications from Africa, with productivity increasing by 10.3\% per
   year (95\% CIs +10.1\% to +10.5\%). The only independent predictor of
   publication outputs was national gross domestic product. For every one
   log US\$ billion increase in gross domestic product, research
   publications rose by 105\%: incidence rate ratio (IRR=2.05, 95\% CI 1.39
   to 3.04). The association of private health expenditure with
   publications was only marginally significant (IRR=1.86, 95\% CI 1.00 to
   3.47).
   Conclusions: There has been a significant improvement in health research
   in the WHO African Region since 2000, with some individual countries
   already having strong research profiles. Countries of the region should
   implement the WHO Strategy on Research for Health: reinforcing the
   research culture (organisation); focusing research on key health
   challenges (priorities); strengthening national health research systems
   (capacity); encouraging good research practice (standards); and
   consolidating linkages between health research and action (translation).}},

   Hospital admission rates declined by an average annual rate of 2\%
   (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR], 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.983,
   0.981-0.984), and burn-related mortality declined by an average annual
   rate of 2\% (IRR, 95\% CI = 0.98, 0.96-1.01). Aboriginal people while
   having significantly higher hospitalization rates than non-Aboriginal
   people experienced a greater 26-year decline in hospitalizations of 58\%
   (IRR, 95\% CI = 0.42, 0.37-0.48) compared with 32\% (IRR, 95\% CI =
   0.68, 0.65-0.71) for non-Aboriginal people. Children younger than 5
   years, 20- to 24-year-old men, and adults older than 65 years remain at
   high risk for burn injury, and males continue to be hospitalized twice
   as frequently as females. The results demonstrate declines in burn
   injury hospitalizations and mortality in both Aboriginal and
   non-Aboriginal populations. Continued research is required of the
   impacts of medical interventions and the burn pathway of identified
   high-risk populations. (J Burn Care Res 2011;32:379-386)}},

Abstract = {{Delicate metal parts with superior electrical, mechanical, and thermal
   properties have attracted a lot of interest, but it is yet challenging
   to fabricate. Herein, a strategy of making complex metallic structures
   is developed in this research through integrating a bioinspired
   catechol-based initiator, dopamine, as an example, into the
   three-dimensional (3D) printing process followed by the assistance of
   surface modification. The wealthy catechol groups growing on the polymer
   enable the metal coating with a high adhesion stability. A series of
   complex metallic structures were fabricated, such as Ni-Co, Cu, and Ni
   Eiffel towers, Ag micro-stretching-dominated architecture, and Au
   auxetic structure. The introduced metal coating enables the 3D-printed
   objects with multiple classes of functionalities, such as magnetism or
   high conductivity. In particular, this method allows in situ repairing
   of the damaged metallic structures, which not only prolongs the lifespan
   of products but also solves the long-lasting challenge of repairing 3D
   printing parts. The detailed fabrication and repairing processes of
   functional metallic parts are presented and discussed. The proposed
   strategy has great potential in practical applications related to
   electronics, energy storage, healthcare, and so on.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{500}},
Pages = {{184-191}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Polycrystalline elastic moduli and stiffness tensor components of
   g-phase U - 8 wt\% Mo have been determined by resonant ultrasound
   spectroscopy in the temperature range of 25-650 degrees C. The ambient
   temperature elastic properties are compared to results measured via
   other experimental methods and show reasonable agreement, though there
   is considerable variation of these properties within the literature at
   both the U - 8 wt\% Mo composition and as a function of Mo
   concentration. The Young's modulus of U - 8 wt\% Mo measured in this
   study decreases steadily with temperature at a rate that is slower than
   trends previously observed at similar Mo concentrations, though the
   difference is not statistically significant. This first measurement of
   the temperature dependent elastic stiffness tensor of a polycrystalline
   U-Mo alloy clarifies that the behavior of the Young's modulus is due to
   a strongly weakening C-11 polycrystalline stiffness tensor component,
   along with milder decreases in C-12 and C-44. The unique partially
   auxetic properties recently predicted for single-crystalline U-Mo are
   discussed in regard to their possible impact on the polycrystalline
   behavior of the alloy. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Using delta generalized additive models to produce distribution maps for
   spatially explicit ecosystem models}},
Journal = {{FISHERIES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{11-24}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Spatial ecosystem models, such as OSMOSE, have become integral tools in
   achieving ecosystem-based management for their ability to thoroughly
   describe predator-prey dynamics in a spatially explicit context.
   Distribution maps, which define the initial spatial allocation of
   functional groups abundance, can have a large effect on the
   predator-prey dynamics that spatially explicit ecosystem models
   simulate. Here, we introduce the delta GAM approach we developed to be
   able to produce distribution maps for an OSMOSE model of the West
   Florida Shelf (Gulf of Mexico), OSMOSE-WFS. This delta GAM approach
   predicts the spatial distribution of different life stages of the
   multiple functional groups represented in OSMOSE-WFS (life-stage
   groups') at different seasons, over the entire Gulf of Mexico (GOM)
   shelf including areas where abundance estimates do not exist, using
   different research survey datasets and regional environmental and
   habitat features. Our delta GAM approach consists of fitting two
   independent models, a binomial GAM and a quasi-Poisson GAM, whose
   predictions are then combined using the delta method to yield spatial
   abundance estimates. To validate delta GAMs, bootstraps are used and
   Spearman's correlation coefficients (Spearman's p's) between predicted
   and observed abundance values are estimated and tested to be
   significantly different from zero. We use pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus
   duorarum) to demonstrate our delta GAM approach by predicting the summer
   distribution of this species over the GOM shelf and the West Florida
   Shelf. Predictions of the delta GAM reflect existing empirical research
   related to pink shrimp habitat preferences and predictions of a negative
   binomial GAM previously designed for the GOM. We find that using a delta
   rather than a negative binomial GAM saves significant computation time
   at the expense of a slight reduction in GAM performance. A positive and
   highly significant Spearman's p between observed and predicted abundance
   values indicates that our delta GAM can reliably be used to predict pink
   shrimp spatial distribution. Spearman's p was also positive and highly
   significant in every life-stage group represented in OSMOSE-WFS and
   season, though often low. Therefore, delta GAMs fitted for the different
   life-stage groups and seasons correctly predict qualitative differences
   between low- and high-abundance areas and are deemed appropriate for
   generating distribution maps for OSMOSE-WFS. The delta GAM approach we
   developed is a simple, convenient method to create distribution maps to
   be fed into spatially explicit ecosystem models, where wide spatial and
   taxonomic coverage is desired while benefits of high precision estimates
   are lost at run-time. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{A 4D imaging study (3D + time) combining synchrotron tomography with in
   situ tensile testing has been carried out to observe the fibre and
   network level micromechanics of paper made from northern bleached
   softwood kraft (NBSK). Quantitative image analysis and digital volume
   correlation is used to characterize local deformation, the evolution of
   fibre-fibre contacts, and fibre straightening in a ``freeze-dried{''}
   handsheet as well as standard handsheets low consistency refined at
   different refining energies. In the freeze-dried handsheet having low
   fibre conformability, the results show that deformation at the network
   level occurs because of fibre straightening and possible inter-fibre
   bond breakage. Further, significant out-of-plane deformation near the
   failure regions was observed, which led to auxetic behaviour. In the
   refined handsheets, a strong inverse correlation is seen between
   refining energy, thickness expansion, and the number of broken fibres.
   The use of out-of-plane strain norms is proposed as a method to
   determine network efficiency (i.e. the ratio of the network's elastic
   modulus to that of the constituent fibres) as well as the relative
   contribution of fibre pull-out to the overall failure of the handsheet.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{371-381}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The emerging concept of mechanical meta-materials has received
   increasing attention during the last few years partially due to the
   advances in additive manufacturing techniques that have enabled
   fabricating materials with arbitrarily complex micro/nano-architectures.
   The rationally designed micro/nano-architecture of mechanical
   meta-materials gives rise to unprecedented or rare mechanical properties
   that could be exploited to create advanced materials with novel
   functionalities. This paper presents an overview of the recent
   developments in the area of mechanical meta-materials. Extremal
   materials that are extremely stiff in certain modes of deformation,
   while extremely soft in other modes of deformation are discussed first.
   Penta-mode, dilational, and other auxetic meta-materials are all
   discussed within the context of extremal materials. Negative
   meta-materials are presented next with special focus on materials with
   negative compressibility and negative stiffness. Ultra-property
   meta-materials are the topic of the following section that covers
   ultra-light, ultra-stiff, and ultra-tough materials. Finally, the
   emerging areas of research in mechanical meta-materials including
   active, adaptive, programmable, and origami-based mechanical
   meta-materials are reviewed. This paper concludes with some suggestions
   for future research.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{63}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The present contribution describes an optimization-based design
   technique of elastic isotropic periodic microarchitectures with crystal
   symmetries aiming at the realization of composites with extreme
   properties. To achieve this goal, three consecutive procedures are
   followed: (i) a series of inverse homogenization problems with symmetry
   constraints, (ii) a correlation analysis between symmetries and
   effective elastic properties of the attained microarchitectures, and
   (iii) the pattern resemblance recognition of these topologies and their
   redesign, by adopting microstructures with two length-scales, through
   optimized parametric geometries. This paper is devoted to assessing the
   third procedure because the first two procedures have been evaluated in
   previous works of the authors, and here they are only summarized. By
   applying the methodology, two plane group symmetries are assessed to
   define two families of 2D periodic parameterized microarchitecture. Once

   Cosserat Continua}},
Journal = {{SYMMETRY-BASEL}},

Abstract = {{In this work, material symmetries in homogenized composites are
   analyzed. Composite materials are described as materials made of rigid
   particles and elastic interfaces. Rigid particles of arbitrary hexagonal
   shape are considered and their geometry described by a limited set of
   parameters. The purpose of this study is to analyze different
   geometrical configurations of the assemblies corresponding to various
   material symmetries such as orthotetragonal, auxetic and chiral. The
   problem is investigated through a homogenization technique which is able
   to carry out constitutive parameters using a principle of energetic
   equivalence. The constitutive law of the homogenized continuum has been
   derived within the framework of Cosserat elasticity, wherein the
   continuum has additional degrees of freedom with respect to classical
   elasticity. A panel composed of material with various symmetries,
   corresponding to some particular hexagonal geometries defined, is
   analyzed under the effect of localized loads. The results obtained show
   the difference of the micropolar response for the considered material
   symmetries, which depends on the non-symmetries of the strain and stress
   tensor as well as on the additional kinematical and work-conjugated
   statical descriptors. This work underlines the importance of resorting
   to the Cosserat theory when analyzing anisotropic materials.}},

   Origami-based Cylindrical Structures}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Origami structures enrich the field of mechanical metamaterials with the
   ability to convert morphologically and systematically between
   two-dimensional (2D) thin sheets and three-dimensional (3D) spatial
   structures. In this study, an in-plane design method is proposed to
   approximate curved surfaces of interest with generalized Miura-ori
   units. Using this method, two combination types of crease lines are
   unified in one reprogrammable procedure, generating multiple types of
   cylindrical structures. Structural completeness conditions of the
   finite-thickness counterparts to the two types are also proposed. As an
   example of the design method, the kinematics and elastic properties of
   an origami-based circular cylindrical shell are analysed. The concept of
   Poisson's ratio is extended to the cylindrical structures, demonstrating
   their auxetic property. An analytical model of rigid plates linked by
   elastic hinges, consistent with numerical simulations, is employed to
   describe the mechanical response of the structures. Under particular
   load patterns, the circular shells display novel mechanical behaviour
   such as snap-through and limiting folding positions. By analysing the
   geometry and mechanics of the origami structures, we extend the design
   space of mechanical metamaterials and provide a basis for their
   practical applications in science and engineering.}},

Title = {{Consequences of the application of the streamer fluid model to the study
   of the sprite inception mechanism}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1902-1915}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{We present the results of a streamer-fluid model used to investigate the
   electrodynamical coupling between the troposphere and upper atmosphere
   due to the penetration of lightning electric fields into the mesosphere
   and the lower ionosphere, generating sprites. The model solves the
   continuity equation for electrons and ions coupled to Poisson equation.
   The dominant physical response of the atmosphere is the formation of a
   screening-ionization wave. The wave shields the atmosphere above it from
   the action of the lightning field and, together with the conductivity
   reduction below it due to attachment, the wave amplifies the total field
   below it, allowing for the penetration of intense electric fields in the
   mesosphere as it propagates downwards into regions of higher density
   that compress the wave. This is the key physical mechanism for sprite
   inception. We evaluated the effects of the thundercloud charge geometry,
   lightning current wave-shape, atmospheric conductivity, via different
   electron density profiles, and the effect of ionization, attachment and
   electron mobility coefficients in the electrical breakdown process,
   related to halo production, and sprite streamer initiation. The results
   showed that electrons with higher mobility are more efficient in
   shielding the lightning electric field before breakdown, causing delay,
   and they contribute to the formation of the streamer seed after
   breakdown, anticipating the sprite streamer inception. Similarly, a
   higher effective ionization rate, produced by modifications in the
   attachment and ionization coefficients, anticipates sprite inception.
   The simulations with 6 different electron density profiles, and
   therefore conductivities, spanning 4 orders of magnitude, showed that
   the altitude of breakdown and sprite initiation, as well as their time
   delays from the lightning discharge are directly related to atmospheric
   conductivity: higher conductivities produce halo and sprite inception at
   lower altitudes with longer delays and may hinder sprite formation. We
   document that variations of 30 times in the lightning current leads to
   sprite initiation altitudes in the range 66.0-73.5 km, with delays
   between 1.550 and 34.500 ms, while variations of 4 orders of magnitude
   in the conductivity profile lead to initiation altitudes 61.0-70.6 km,
   with delays in the range 3.825-9.825 ms. Consequently, we suggest that
   lightning characteristics dominate over atmospheric parameters in
   determining sprites' initiation altitude and delay. The simulation of a
   -CG, with a constant current of 30 kA, did not produce a sprite seed,
   confirming an asymmetry in the response of the atmosphere to positive
   and negative lightning. This is due to the free electron drift direction
   that is away from the screening ionization wave, preventing the
   formation of the streamer seed for the great majority of -CGs. The same
   does not apply to halos, which depend on the occurrence of breakdown and
   can be produced by discharges of both polarities. (C) 2012 COSPAR.

Abstract = {{Sandwich panels most commonly used in the furniture industry are layered
   structures composed of a hexagonal cell paper core. The use of
   wood-based composites in modelling truss and pyramidal cores of layered
   furniture panels is rather scarce. The effect of geometry in the auxetic
   truss core on the mechanical properties of manufactured wood-based
   materials was primarily explored in this study. Moreover, the need to
   conduct further studies was also stressed to determine the elastic
   properties of cells and cores manufactured from wood filaments using 3D
   printing. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the type
   of filament used in 3D printing and the geometry of pyramidal core cells
   on elastic constants in cores with identical relative density. This
   paper presented analytical models of manufactured cells, results of
   numerical calculations performed using the finite element method, as
   well as experimental tests determining elastic constants of the cores.
   Digital image analysis was used and showed that cell geometry had a
   considerable effect on elastic properties of the core while maintaining
   identical relative density of these structures. The angle of cell arms
   had a particularly marked effect on these properties.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To determine Incidence rate, seasonal variation, and short-
   and long-term outcomes of Klebsiella species bloodstream infection (BSI)
   In a population-based setting.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 127 unique patients In Olmsted
   County, Minnesota, from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2007, who had
   Klebsiella spp BSI. Multivarlable Poisson regression was used to examine
   temporal change and seasonal variation in incidence rate, and Cox
   proportional hazards regression was used to determine predictors of
   mortality.
   RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence rate of Klebsiella spp BSI per
   100,000 person-years was 15.4 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   11.6-19.2) in men and 9.4 (95\% CI, 7.0-11.8) in women. There was no
   linear increase in incidence rate of Klebsiella spp BSI during the study
   period (P=.55). The incidence rate of Klebsiella spp BSI increased at
   quadratic rate with age (P=.005). No significant difference was noted in
   incidence rate of Klebsiella spp BSI during the warmest 4 months
   compared to the rest of the year (incidence rate ratio, 0.97; 95\% CI,
   0.66-1.38; P=.95). The overall 28-day and 1-year all-cause mortality
   rates of Klebsiella spp BSI were 14\% (95\% CI, 9\%22\%) and 35\% (95\%
   CI, 27\%-44\%), respectively. Respiratory source of BSI was associated
   with a higher 28-day mortality (hazard ratio, 4.90; 95\% CI, 1.73-13.84;
   P=.003).
   CONCLUSION: The Incidence rate of Klebsiella spp BSI increased with age.
   There was no temporal change or seasonal variation in Incidence rate of
   Klebsiella spp BSI during the past decade. The 28-day all-cause
   mortality rate of Klebsiella spp BSI was relatively low; however, a
   respiratory source of BSI was associated with a poorer outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is associated
   with release of neurotoxic metallic or metalloid chemical elements

   Objective: To examine associations between prenatal exposure and
   co-exposure to total lead (T-Pb), total mercury (T-Hg), total cadmium
   (T-Cd) and total arsenic (T-As) and infant neurodevelopment at 6 to 12
   months of age in areas with ASGM activities in Tanzania.
   Methods: Women in their second trimester of pregnancy who resided in
   ASGM areas were enrolled from 2015 to 2017 (n = 883). At 6 to 12 months
   of age, children were assessed with the Malawi Developmental Assessment
   Tool (MDAT) (n = 439). We measured T-Pb, T-Hg, and T-Cd in maternal
   dried blood spots and T-As in maternal urines. Poisson regression was

   Results: Prenatal T-Hg concentration was associated with global

   impairment (aPR 1.05, CI:1.03-1.07; p < 0.001) on the MDAT. When
   prenatal T-Hg and T-As values were at or above the human biomonitoring
   reference values (>= 95\%) of the German Environmental Survey for Human
   Biomonitoring, that is 0.80 mu g/L and 15 mu g/L, respectively, the
   prevalence ratio of global neurodevelopmental impairment was two times
   higher (aPR 2.1, CI:1.0-4.3; p = 0.034). There was a 40\% increase in
   the prevalence ratio of global neurodevelopmental impairment (aPR 1.4,
   CI:0.90-2.10, p = 0.027), when prenatal T-Hg was at or above the
   reference value of 0.80 mu g/L and T-Pb was at or above the reference
   value of 35 mu g/L. When prenatal T-Hg was at or above the reference
   value of 0.80 mu g/L and T-As was at or above the reference value of 15
   mu g/L, the prevalence ratio of global neurodevelopmental impairment was
   two times higher (aPR 2.1, CI:1.0-4.3; p < 0.034).
   Discussion: Infants born to women in areas with ASGM activities are at
   significant risk for neurodevelopmental impairment and this is
   associated with exposure to higher concentrations of Hg prenatally.
   Co-exposure to high concentrations of Hg and Pb, or Hg and As appeared
   to have negative potentiated effects on infants' neurodevelopment.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{For lightweight cellular structures fabricated via powder bed fusion
   additive manufacturing (PBF-AM), both the material anisotropy and the
   cellular topology design are both important design factors. In this
   work, a direct stiffness matrix-based analytical modeling approach was
   employed for the evaluation of material anisotropy topology effects on
   three representative 3D cellular structures (auxetic, BCC and
   octahedral). The established models were verified via experimentation
   with samples fabricated by EB-PBF using Ti6Al4V as material, using the
   material anisotropy information established experimentally using single
   struts with different build orientations (0?, 15?, 30?, 45?, 60?, 75?
   and 90?). The predicted mechanical properties of the Ti6Al4V cellular
   structures showed good agreement with experimental results. It was shown
   that both the strength and elastic modulus anisotropy of the materials
   affect the strength of the cellular structures, which must be determined
   based on the topology design. In addition, the material
   anisotropy-topology effects on cellular structures of varying cellular
   pattern sizes were also investigated in order to quantify the pattern
   size effects. It was found that the pattern size effects and the
   material anisotropy effects can be decoupled during the design of the
   mechanical properties of these cellular structures.}},

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{47}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel lattice structure for energy absorption
   application is proposed that is modified from the traditional
   face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice by introducing a cross-rod at the
   center of the cell. A thorough study is carried out to investigate the
   quasi-static crushing behavior of the proposed lattice through
   theoretical modeling, numerical simulation and experimental tests. The
   experimental specimens are fabricated via additive manufacturing
   technique of selective laser melting (SLM). The plateau stress and
   energy absorption obtained from the theoretical, numerical and
   experimental approaches are consistent with each other. It indicates
   that the new lattice structures have larger plateau stress and better
   energy absorption performance than the traditional FCC structure. Both
   2D and 3D configurations are examined and show the same tendency. A
   numerical parametric study is carried out to investigate the effect of
   the geometric parameters, which indicates that the proposed lattice
   structures with appropriate length coefficient have larger energy
   absorption capacity compared with the traditional FCC lattice. In
   addition, auxetic and zero-Poisson effects are also exhibited in the new
   lattice structures. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{157-180}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The buckling of a finite section of a cylindrical shell resembling a
   two-dimensional contact lens, and the collapse of a tubular shell of
   infinite extent are considered. The deformation is due, respectively, to
   the application of an edge force or to a negative transmural pressure.
   In both cases, the shell develops elastic bending moments due to the
   deformation from a specified resting shape according to a linear
   constitutive equation, accompanied by in-plane and transverse shear
   tensions. In the case of a section of a shell with a flat resting shape,
   classical results due to Euler and Love show that, as the applied edge
   force is increased beyond a sequence of thresholds, an infinite family
   of deformed shapes becomes possible corresponding to buckled states that
   bifurcate from the zero-curvature resting configuration. It is shown
   here that a corresponding infinite family of shapes is also possible for
   a finite shell whose resting shape is a section of circle. These shapes,
   however, no longer arise from bifurcations, but rather constitute
   disconnected solution branches of a nonlinear boundary-value problem. A
   closed cylindrical shell whose cross-section has a circular resting
   shape exhibits similar bifurcations when the difference between the
   exterior and interior pressure exceeds a sequence of thresholds, but a
   shell with a non-circular resting shape deforms into a multitude of
   shapes described by isolated solution branches. The computed
   two-dimensional buckled shapes are used to reconstruct the
   three-dimensional shape of a slowly collapsing fluid-conveying vessel.
   The reconstruction procedure involves stacking together cross-sections
   at axial positions that are found by integrating the differential
   equation determining the axial pressure distribution in unidirectional
   pressure-driven flow, subject to a constant flow rate. The dimensionless
   coefficient relating the local pressure gradient to the flow rate is
   computed by solving the Poisson equation governing unidirectional
   viscous flow using a boundary-element method, and expressing the flow
   rate as a boundary integral involving the shear stress which is
   available from the solution of the boundary-integral equation. In an
   appendix, the energy of the bending state is discussed with reference to
   specific choices made by previous authors in various branches of science
   and engineering.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive review on the latest development of the
   antiferroelectric <-> ferroelectric phase transition is presented. The
   abrupt volume expansion and sudden development of polarization at the
   phase transition has been extensively investigated in PbZrO3-based
   perovskite ceramics. New research developments in these compositions,
   including the incommensurate domain structure, the auxetic behavior
   under electric fields in the induced ferroelectric phase, the
   ferroelastic behavior of the multicell cubic phase, the impact of radial
   compression, the unexpected electric field-induced
   ferroelectric-to-antiferroelectric transition, and the phase transition
   mechanical toughening effect have been summarized. Due to their
   significance to lead-free piezoelectric ceramics, compounds with
   antiferroelectric phases, including NaNbO3, AgNbO3, and
   (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3, are also critically reviewed. Focus has been placed on
   the (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3BaTiO3 solid solution where the electric
   field-induced ferroelectric phase remains even after the applied field
   is removed at room temperature. Therefore, the electric field-induced
   antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition is a key to the
   poling process to develop piezoelectricity in morphotropic phase
   boundary (MPB) compositions. The competing phase transition and domain
   switching processes in 0.93(Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO30.07BaTiO3 are directly
   imaged with nanometer resolution using the unique in situ transmission

Abstract = {{Periodic lattices offer enhanced mechanical and dynamic properties per
   unit mass, and the ability to engineer the material response by
   optimizing the unit cell. Characterizing the effective properties of
   these lattice materials through experiments can be a time consuming and
   costly process, so analytical and numerical methods are crucial.
   Specifically, the Bloch-wave homogenization approach allows one to
   characterize the effective static properties of the lattice while
   simultaneously analyzing wave propagation properties such as band gaps,
   propagating modes, and wave directionality. While this analysis has been
   used for some time, a thorough study of this approach on
   three-dimensional (3D) lattice materials with different symmetries and
   geometries is presented here. Bloch-wave homogenization is applied to
   extract the effective stiffness tensor of 3D periodic lattices and
   confirmed with elastostatic homogenization, both within a finite element
   framework. Multiple periodic lattices with cubic, transversely
   isotropic, and tetragonal symmetry, including an auxetic geometry, over
   a wide range of relative densities are analyzed. Further, this approach
   is used to analyze 3D periodic composite structures, and a way to tailor
   their overall anisotropy is demonstrated. This work can serve as the
   basis for nondestructive evaluation of metamaterials properties using
   ultrasonic velocity measurements. (C) 2019 Acoustical Society of

   or negative) inertia of the particles relative to the displaced fluid,
   and accounts for thermal fluctuations in the fluid momentum equation.
   The coupling between the fluid and the blob is based on a no-slip
   constraint equating the particle velocity with the local average of the
   fluid velocity, and conserves momentum and energy. We demonstrate that
   the formulation obeys a fluctuation-dissipation balance, owing to the
   non-dissipative nature of the no-slip coupling. We develop a
   spatio-temporal discretization that preserves, as best as possible,
   these properties of the continuum formulation. In the spatial
   discretization, the local averaging and spreading operations are
   accomplished using compact kernels commonly used in immersed boundary
   methods. We find that the special properties of these kernels allow the
   blob to provide an effective model of a particle; specifically, the
   volume, mass, and hydrodynamic properties of the blob are remarkably
   grid-independent. We develop a second-order semi-implicit temporal
   integrator that maintains discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance, and
   is not limited in stability by viscosity. Furthermore, the temporal
   scheme requires only constant-coefficient Poisson and Helmholtz linear
   solvers, enabling a very efficient and simple FFT-based implementation
   on GPUs. We numerically investigate the performance of the method on
   several standard test problems. In the deterministic setting, we find
   the blob to be a remarkably robust approximation to a rigid sphere, at
   both low and high Reynolds numbers. In the stochastic setting, we study
   in detail the short and long-time behavior of the velocity
   autocorrelation function and observe agreement with all of the known
   behavior for rigid sphere immersed in a fluctuating fluid. The proposed
   inertial coupling method provides a low-cost coarse-grained (minimal
   resolution) model of particulate flows over a wide range of time-scales
   ranging from Brownian to convection-driven motion. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Our goals for this study were to characterize the frequency
   of agitation in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) admitted to
   an inpatient pediatric medical unit and to identify risk factors
   associated with agitation.
   METHODS: Through a retrospective chart review, we identified every
   patient between 8 and 19 years of age with a documented ASD diagnosis
   admitted to a pediatric medical unit over a 5-year period. We performed
   a detailed review of each admission, with a focus on factors
   hypothesized to be correlated with risk of agitation.
   RESULTS: One or more episode of agitation occurred during 37 (12.4\%) of
   the 299 admissions and for 31 (18.5\%) of the 168 patients who met
   inclusion criteria. History of agitation (risk ratio 21.9 {[}95\%
   confidence interval 5.4-88.3] for history of severe agitation; P < .001)
   and documented sensory sensitivities (risk ratio 2.3 {[}95\% confidence
   interval 1.3-3.8]; P < .001) were associated with a significantly
   increased risk of agitation during admission. History of past
   psychiatric admissions was associated with increased risk before, but
   not after, controlling for history of agitation and sensory
   sensitivities. Psychiatric comorbidity, intellectual disability, acute
   pain on admission, number of preadmission psychotropic medications,
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition
   ASD diagnosis, age, and sex were not significantly associated with
   increased risk.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization can be challenging for patients with ASD. A
   subset of these patients experience episodes of agitation during
   admission, posing a safety risk to patients and staff. Characterizing
   risk factors associated with these behaviors may allow for
   identification of at-risk patients and guide targeted intervention to
   prevent negative behavioral outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of the full crystal structure of the uranyl sulfate
   mineral uranopilite, (UO2)(6)(SO4)O-2(OH)(6)center dot 14H(2)O,
   including the positions of the hydrogen atoms within the corresponding
   unit cell, has not been feasible to date due to the poor quality of its
   X-ray diffraction pattern. In this paper, the complete crystal structure
   of uranopilite is established for the first time by means of first
   principles solid-state calculations based in density functional theory
   employing a large plane wave basis set and pseudopotential functions.
   The computed unit-cell parameters and structural data for the
   non-hydrogen atoms are in excellent agreement with the available
   experimental data. The computed X-ray diffraction pattern is also in
   satisfactory agreement with the experimental pattern. The infrared
   spectrum of uranopilite is collected from a natural crystal specimen
   originating in Jachymov (Czech Republic) and computed employing density
   functional perturbation theory. The theoretical and experimental
   vibrational spectra are highly consistent. Therefore, a full assignment
   of the bands in the experimental infrared spectrum is performed using a
   normal mode analysis of the first principles vibrational results. One
   overtone and six combination bands are recognized in the infrared
   spectrum. The elasticity tensor and phonon spectra of uranopilite are
   computed from the optimized crystal structure and used to analyze its
   mechanical stability, to obtain a rich set of elastic properties and to
   derive its fundamental thermodynamic properties as a function of
   temperature. Uranopilite is shown to have a large mechanical anisotropy
   and to exhibit the negative Poisson's ratio and negative linear
   compressibility phenomena. The calculated specific heat and entropy at
   298.15 K are 179.6 and 209.0 J K(-1)mol(-1), respectively. The computed
   fundamental thermodynamic functions of uranopilite are employed to
   obtain its thermodynamic functions of formation in terms of the elements
   and the thermodynamic properties of a set of chemical reactions relating
   uranopilite with a representative group of secondary phases of spent
   nuclear fuel. From the reaction thermodynamic data, the relative
   stability of uranopilite with respect to these secondary phases is
   evaluated as a function of temperature and under different hydrogen
   peroxide concentrations. From the results, it follows that uranopilite
   has a very large thermodynamic stability in the presence of hydrogen
   peroxide. The high stability of uranopilite under this condition justify
   its early crystallization in the paragenetic sequence of secondary
   phases occurring when uranium dioxide is exposed to sulfur-rich
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Background. South Africa (SA) has the highest burden of HIV in the
   world. This study sought to evaluate the impact of high HIV prevalence
   on the burden of disease in an emergency department (ED).
   Objectives. To determine the burden of comorbidities in HIV-positive
   emergency care patients, their demographic profiles and severity of
   illness were compared with the general ED population in order to make
   recommendations for resource allocation and training in EDs in SA.
   Methods. A prospective cross-sectional observational study was conducted
   from June 2017 to July 2018 in three EDs in Eastern Cape Province. All
   eligible patients (aged >= 18 years, fully conscious and clinically
   stable) presenting to the ED during the 6-week study period were
   approached and asked to give consent for a point-of-care HIV test and
   collection of demographic information. Simple descriptive statistics
   were used to analyse data. Log binomial and Poisson models were fitted
   to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs).
   Results. Over the total study period, 8 000 patients presented to the ED
   for care across all sites and 3 537 patients were enrolled. The HIV
   status of 2 901 individuals (82.0\%) was determined. Of those who were
   screened, 811 (28.0\%) were identified as HIV-positive. Medical
   complaints were more common in HIV-positive patients (n=586, 72.3\%)
   than in trauma patients (n=225, 27.7\%). In comparison, HIV-negative
   patients reported fewer medical complaints (n=1 137, 54.4\%) and more
   trauma (n=953, 45.6\%) (p<0.001). HIV-positive patients were more likely
   to have a life-threatening emergency (n=192, 23.7\%) (p=0.004), to be
   critically ill by triage score (p<0.001) and to be admitted to the
   hospital (p<0.001) than those who were HIV-negative. Despite high acuity
   overall, people living with HIV/AIDS were significantly less likely to
   be deemed critically ill according to vital signs (adjusted PR 0.94;
   p=0.046).
   Conclusions. While EDs in SA provide care to high volumes of patients
   with trauma-related injuries, in areas where HIV prevalence is highest,
   patients are more likely to present with acute medical emergencies.
   Providers of emergency care in SA need to be well versed in the
   management of HIV and associated complications.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in lipid composition have recently been shown to exert
   appreciable influences on the activities of membrane-bound proteins and
   peptides. We tested the hypothesis that the conformational states of
   rhodopsin linked to visual signal transduction are related to
   biophysical properties of the membrane lipid bilayer. For bovine
   rhodopsin, the meta I-meta II conformational transition was studied in
   egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) recombinants versus the native rod outer
   segment (ROS) membranes by means of flash photolysis, Formation of
   metarhodopsin II was observed by the change in absorbance at 478 nm
   after a single actinic flash was delivered to the sample. The meta
   I/meta II ratio was investigated as a function of both temperature and
   pH. The data clearly demonstrated thermodynamic reversibility of the
   transition for both the egg PC recombinants and the native ROS
   membranes. A significant shift of the apparent pK(a) for the acid-base
   equilibrium to lower values was evident in the egg PC recombinant, with
   little meta II produced under physiological conditions. Calculations of
   the membrane surface pH using a Poisson-Boltzmann model suggested the
   free energies of the meta I and meta 11 states were significantly
   affected by electrostatic properties of the bilayer lipids. In the ROS
   membranes, phosphatidylserine (PS) is needed for full formation of meta
   II, in combination with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and
   polyunsaturated docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6omega3) chains. We
   propose that the PS surface potential leads to an accumulation of
   hydronium ions, H3O+, in the electrical double layer, which drive the
   reaction together with the large negative spontaneous curvature (H-0)
   conferred by PE plus DHA chains. The elastic stress/strain of the
   bilayer arises from an interplay of the similar to zero H-0 from PS and
   the negative H-0 due to the PE headgroups and polyunsaturated chains.
   The lipid influences are further explained in terms of matching of the
   bilayer spontaneous curvature to the curvature at the lipid/rhodopsin
   interface, as formulated by the Helfrich bending energy. These new
   findings guide current ideas as to how bilayer properties govern the
   conformational energetics of integral membrane proteins. Moreover, they
   yield knowledge of how membrane lipid-protein interactions involving
   acidic phospholipids such as PS and neutral polyunsaturated DHA chains
   are implicated in key biological functions such as vision.}},

Abstract = {{Human-animal relationships are essential for dairy farming. They affect
   work comfort and efficiency, as well as milk production. A poor
   human-animal relationship can result in stress and accidents to both
   animals and caretakers and needs to be improved. However, many studies
   have demonstrated the multifactoriality of these relationships. We aimed
   at assessing the relative importance of the various factors expected to
   be associated with poor human-animal relationships. On 118 dairy farms,
   we applied a standardized avoidance distance test to cows at the feeding
   rack. The sample of farms covered a wide range of situations: lowland
   versus highland, small versus medium size farms, cubicles versus
   deep-bedded systems, milking parlor versus automatic milking systems,
   and Holstein versus Montbeliarde breeds. We used Poisson regression to
   analyze the links between the number of cows that accepted being
   touched, and farm characteristics, animals, management, and farmers'
   attitudes. A multivariate analysis yielded a final model that explained
   32.7\% of the variability between farms. Calving conditions ({''}Main
   calving location{''} and ``Cleaning or adding litter after calving{''})
   accounted for a significant part of the variability observed
   (respectively 25.8 and 13.6\% of variability explained by the model,
   SSB). Fewer cows accepted being touched on farms where the main calving
   location was in the barn, and where farmers cleaned or added litter
   after calving. The proportion of cows that accepted being touched
   increased with the proportion of lean cows in the herd (18.8\%), with
   worker/cow ratio on the farm (11.7\%), when farmers considered
   ``health{''} or ``human-cow relationships{''} as most important issues
   for farm success (10.4\%), and with farmers' years of experience
   (10.8\%). Farmers with more negative behavioral attitudes toward cows
   had a lower proportion of cows that accepted being touched (8.9\%). In
   conclusion, the human-animal relationship was not found to be associated
   with farm characteristics (e.g., housing or milking system) but varied
   with farmers' attitudes and management. We confirm that cows' fear of
   people is linked to negative attitudes displayed by caretakers toward
   cows, and is reduced in farms where several caretakers are present. Our
   study also suggests further exploring the key role of factors linked to
   calving conditions, as cows are more likely to be afraid of people when
   disturbed at calving.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Previous studies suggested that a bundled intervention was
   associated with lower rates of Staphylococcus aureus surgical site
   infections (SSIs) among patients having cardiac or orthopedic
   operations.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the implementation of an evidence-based
   bundle is associated with a lower risk of S aureus SSIs in patients
   undergoing cardiac operations or hip or knee arthroplasties.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Twenty hospitals in 9 US states
   participated in this pragmatic study; rates of SSIs were collected for a
   median of 39 months (range, 39-43) during the preintervention period
   (March 1, 2009, to intervention) and a median of 21 months (range,
   14-22) during the intervention period (from intervention start through
   March 31, 2014).
   INTERVENTIONS Patients whose preoperative nares screens were positive
   for methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-susceptible S
   aureus (MSSA) were asked to apply mupirocin intranasally twice daily for
   up to 5 days and to bathe daily with chlorhexidine-gluconate (CHG) for
   up to 5 days before their operations. MRSA carriers received vancomycin
   and cefazolin or cefuroxime for perioperative prophylaxis; all others
   received cefazolin or cefuroxime. Patients who were MRSA-negative and
   MSSA-negative bathed with CHG the night before and morning of their
   operations. Patients were treated as MRSA-positive if screening results
   were unknown.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas complex (deep
   incisional or organ space) S aureus SSIs. Monthly SSI counts were
   analyzed using Poisson regression analysis.
   RESULTS After a 3-month phase-in period, bundle adherence was 83\%(39\%
   full adherence; 44\% partial adherence). Overall, 101 complex S aureus
   SSIs occurred after 28 218 operations during the preintervention period
   and 29 occurred after 14 316 operations during the intervention period
   (mean rate per 10 000 operations, 36 for preintervention period vs 21
   for intervention period, difference, -15 {[}95\% CI, -35 to -2]; rate
   ratio {[}RR], 0.58 {[}95\% CI, 0.37 to 0.92]). The rates of complex S
   aureus SSIs decreased for hip or knee arthroplasties (difference per 10
   000 operations, -17 {[}95\% CI, -39 to 0]; RR, 0.48 {[}95\% CI, 0.29 to
   0.80]) and for cardiac operations (difference per 10 000 operations, -6
   {[}95\% CI, -48 to 8]; RR, 0.86 {[}95\% CI, 0.47 to 1.57]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this multicenter study, a bundle comprising
   S aureus screening, decolonization, and targeted prophylaxis was
   associated with a modest, statistically significant decrease in complex
   S aureus SSIs.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundIncluding twins in randomised trials leads to non-independence
   or clustering in the data. Clustering has important implications for
   sample size calculations, yet few trials take this into account.
   Estimates of the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC), or the
   correlation between outcomes of twins, are needed to assist with sample
   size planning. Our aims were to provide ICC estimates for infant
   outcomes, describe the information that must be specified in order to
   account for clustering due to twins in sample size calculations, and
   develop a simple tool for performing sample size calculations for trials
   including twins.
   MethodsICCs were estimated for infant outcomes collected in four
   randomised trials that included twins. The information required to
   account for clustering due to twins in sample size calculations is
   described. A tool that calculates the sample size based on this
   information was developed in Microsoft Excel and in R as a Shiny web
   app.
   ResultsICC estimates ranged between -0.12, indicating a weak negative
   relationship, and 0.98, indicating a strong positive relationship
   between outcomes of twins. Example calculations illustrate how the ICC
   estimates and sample size calculator can be used to determine the target
   sample size for trials including twins.
   ConclusionsClustering among outcomes measured on twins should be taken
   into account in sample size calculations to obtain the desired power.
   Our ICC estimates and sample size calculator will be useful for
   designing future trials that include twins. Publication of additional
   ICCs is needed to further assist with sample size planning for future
   trials.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the validity and accuracy of three interatomic potentials
   and the continuum shell model of Ghaffari and Sauer {[}1] are
   investigated. The mechanical behavior of single-layered graphene sheets
   (SLGSs) under uniaxial stretching, biaxial stretching and pure bending
   is studied for this comparison. The validity of the molecular and
   continuum models is assessed by direct comparison with density
   functional theory (DFT) data available in the literature. The molecular
   simulations are carried out employing the MM3, Tersoff and REBO + LJ
   potentials. The continuum formulation uses an anisotropic hyperelastic
   material model in the framework of the geometrically exact
   Kirchhoff-Love shell theory and isogeometric finite elements. Results
   from the continuum model are in good agreement with those from DFT. The
   results from the MM3 potential agree well up to the point of material
   instability, whereas those from the REBO + LJ and Tersoff potentials
   agree only for small deformations. Only the Tersoff potential is found
   to yield auxetic response in SLGSs under uniaxial stretch. Additionally,
   the transverse vibration frequencies of a pre-stretched graphene sheet
   and a carbon nanocone are obtained using the continuum model and
   molecular simulations with the MM3 potential. The variations of the
   frequencies from these approaches agree within an error of approximate
   to 5\%. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The limited range of mechanical responses achievable by materials
   compatible with additive manufacturing hinders the 3D printing of
   continuum soft robots with programmed motion. This paper describes the
   rapid design and fabrication of low-density, 3D-architected soft
   machines (ASMs) by combining Voronoi tessellation and additive
   manufacturing. On tendon-based actuation, ASMs deform according to the
   topologically encoded buckling of their structure to produce a wide
   range of motions (contraction, twisting, bending, and cyclic motion).
   ASMs exhibiting densities as low as 0.094 g cm(-3) (approximate to 8\%
   of bulk polymer) can be rapidly built by the stereolithographic 3D
   printing of flexible photopolymers or the injection molding of
   elastomers. The buckling of ASMs can be programmed by inducing gradients
   in the thickness of their flexible beams or by the localized enlargement
   of the Voronoi cells to generate complex motions such as multi-finger
   gripping or quadrupedal locomotion. The topological architecture of
   these low-density soft robots confers them with the stiffness necessary
   to recover their original shape even after ultrahigh compression (400\%)
   and extension (500\%). ASMs expand the range of mechanical properties
   currently achievable by 3D printed or molded materials to enable the
   fabrication of soft machines with auxetic mechanical metamaterial
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents and examines the concept of flexible skins for
   morphing aircraft applications comprising of a cellular honeycomb core
   covered by a compliant face-sheet. The overall properties of the
   flexible skins are then largely governed by the characteristics of the
   cellular honeycomb core, which are in turn dependent on the cell
   parameters. The results of this study showed that the cellular cores
   could easily undergo global strains over 10 times greater than the
   virgin material of which they were built. The in-plane stiffness of the
   cellular cores is generally several orders of magnitude lower than the
   virgin material. Using cores that are thicker than isotropic sheet
   skins, the out-of-plane stiffness can be many times greater than the
   sheet skin for comparable mass (due to porosity of the cellular core).
   In general, honeycomb cores with positive cell angles (as opposed to
   auxetic cores) produce a higher out-of-plane stiffness. For cellular
   cores made from high-strain capable materials and undergoing large
   strains, geometric and material non-linearities need to be considered.
   When the cores are stretched along the principle axes they geometrically
   stiffen, thereby reducing the maximum global strains achievable. When
   material softening is considered, the forces required to deform the
   cellular core to large global strains are reduced.}},

Title = {{A Newton solver for micromorphic computational homogenization enabling
   multiscale buckling analysis of pattern-transforming metamaterials}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{372}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials feature engineered microstructures designed to
   exhibit exotic, and often counter-intuitive, effective behaviour such as
   negative Poisson's ratio or negative compressibility. Such a specific
   response is often achieved through instability-induced transformations
   of the underlying periodic microstructure into one or multiple
   patterning modes. Due to a strong kinematic coupling of individual
   repeating microstructural cells, non-local behaviour and size effects
   emerge, which cannot easily be captured by classical homogenization
   schemes. In addition, the individual patterning modes can mutually
   interact in space as well as in time, while at the engineering scale the
   entire structure can buckle globally. For efficient numerical
   predictions of macroscale engineering applications, a micromorphic
   computational homogenization scheme has recently been developed (Roko et
   al., J. Mech. Phys. Solids 123, 119-137, 2019). Although this framework
   is in principle capable of accounting for spatial and temporal
   interactions between individual patterning modes, its implementation
   relied on a gradient -based quasi-Newton solution technique. This solver
   is suboptimal because (i) it has sub-quadratic convergence, and (ii) the
   absence of Hessians does not allow for proper bifurcation analyses.
   Given that mechanical metamaterials often rely on controlled
   instabilities, these limitations are serious. Addressing them will
   reduce the dependency of the solution on the initial guess by perturbing
   the system towards the correct deformation when a bifurcation point is
   encountered. Eventually, this enables more accurate and reliable
   modelling and design of metamaterials. To achieve this goal, a full
   Newton method, entailing all derivations and definitions of the tangent
   operators, is provided in detail in this paper. The construction of the
   macroscopic tangent operator is not straightforward due to specific
   model assumptions on the decomposition of the underlying displacement
   field pertinent to the micromorphic framework, involving orthogonality
   constraints. Analytical expressions for the first and second variation
   of the total potential energy are given, and the complete algorithm is
   listed. The developed methodology is demonstrated with two examples in
   which a competition between local and global buckling exists and where
   multiple patterning modes emerge. The numerical results indicate that
   local to global buckling transition can be predicted within a relative
   error of 6\% in terms of the applied strains. The expected pattern
   combinations are triggered even for the case of multiple patterns. (C)

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to fabricate polyamide 6 (PA6) composite
   filament with enhanced mechanical properties and low cost for fused
   deposition modeling (FDM). The composite filaments are obtained by
   compounding PA6 and talcum fillers and then single screw extruding.
   Virgin PA6 and commercial e-PA6 are set as controls. First, the
   rheological behaviors and thermal properties of PA6/talc, PA6, and e-PA6
   pellet materials are investigated, including viscosity, melting
   temperature, crystallinity, and decomposition temperature, which are
   important parameters for fabricating filament feedstocks. The results
   show that 10 wt\% addition of talcum content accelerates the increase of
   the viscosity among the processing temperature. Accordingly, virgin PA6
   and PA6/talc5 with good flowability are produced and subsequently
   evaluated by tensile and flexural tests. It is notable that the
   introduction of talcum increases the diameter constant and shape
   stability of PA6-based filament. Also, it is found that both PA6 and
   Pa6/talc5 filaments exhibit superior tensile properties to the
   commercial e-PA6 counterparts. Especially, PA6/talc5 filaments achieve
   the maximum tensile yield strength of 67.1 MPa and modulus of 3.10 GPa.
   Finally, auxetic lattice parts are successfully printed via FDM using
   lab-made PA6, PA6/talc5, and commercial e-PA6 filaments, and PA6/talc5
   exhibits remarkable loading and energy absorption capability.}},

Title = {{Actomyosin and vimentin cytoskeletal networks regulate nuclear shape,
   mechanics and chromatin organization}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 12}},
Abstract = {{The regulation of nuclear state by the cytoskeleton is an important part
   of cellular function. Actomyosin stress fibres, microtubules and
   intermediate filaments have distinct and complementary roles in
   integrating the nucleus into its environment and influencing its
   mechanical state. However, the interconnectedness of cytoskeletal
   networks makes it difficult to dissect their individual effects on the
   nucleus. We use simple image analysis approaches to characterize nuclear
   state, estimating nuclear volume, Poisson's ratio, apparent elastic
   modulus and chromatin condensation. By combining them with cytoskeletal
   quantification, we assess how cytoskeletal organization regulates
   nuclear state. We report for a number of cell types that nuclei display
   auxetic properties. Furthermore, stress fibres and intermediate
   filaments modulate the mechanical properties of the nucleus and also
   chromatin condensation. Conversely, nuclear volume and its gross
   morphology are regulated by intracellular outward pulling forces exerted
   by myosin. The modulation exerted by the cytoskeleton onto the nucleus
   results in changes that are of similar magnitude to those observed when
   the nucleus is altered intrinsically, inducing chromatin decondensation
   or cell differentiation. Our approach allows pinpointing the
   contribution of distinct cytoskeletal proteins to nuclear mechanical
   state in physio- and pathological conditions, furthering our
   understanding of a key aspect of cellular behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, I have introduced the current status and outlook for the
   field of tree ring analysis research in Japan, including
   dendrochronology, dendroclimatology and environmentology. There was a
   time when the application of dendrochronology techniques, which are
   commonly used in research of tree ring analysis, was considered
   difficult due to the warm climate and high volume of precipitation in
   Japan. In recent years, there have been growing expectations for the
   application of these techniques, such as proposals for new concepts of
   dating in the area of archaeological age determination. In order to
   establish tree ring analysis research in Japan, it is essential that we
   investigate standardization functions applied to eliminating trend
   variations occurring with age from the tree ring time series, and
   functions applied to the calculation of minute variations resulting from
   environmental factors. In conjunction with this, the following examples
   have been proposed as potential projects for the future.
   1) Comparative study of proposed functions. 2) Construction of a
   cross-check system for dated samples obtained with these techniques. 3)
   Verification of the contribution ratio of environmental factors
   contributing to auxetic growth. 4) Construction of a database for

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present novel methods for exploiting passive and
   active radially folding mechanisms for reactive and dynamic structures.
   These enable the application of radially folding structures in domains
   including fluidics, medical stents, and auxetic materials. A compact
   form of elastic deployment utilizing linkage strain energy is proposed
   using beam theory analysis. Elastic strain energy is also shown to
   produce bistable folding behavior, with two low energy states at full
   contraction and full expansion, and a bistable switching point at some
   intermediate position. Polymeric smart materials are investigated for
   driving active folding. These materials can be readily exploited through
   the features of the folding structure including its ability to resolve
   1-D, 2-D, and 3-D actuation strains into a more effective single
   degree-of-freedom linear, areal, volumetric or rotational output. The
   elastic and solid-state nature of many polymeric smart materials means
   they can implement elastic deployment and bistability. A
   thermally-activated shape memory polymer is shown to fold a 4-segment
   structure from expanded to contracted states. Experimental testing of an
   8-segment dielectric elastomer actuator prototype demonstrates that
   radially folding structures can resolve large biaxial planar strains
   generated by dielectric elastomers into a single linear or rotational
   output stroke.}},

Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{The lattice dynamics and molecular vibrations of benzene and deuterated
   benzene crystals are calculated from force constants derived from
   density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and compared with measured
   inelastic neutron-scattering spectra. A very small change (0.5\%) in
   lattice parameter is required to obtain real lattice-mode frequencies
   across the Brillouin zone. There is a strong coupling between wagging
   and breathing modes away from the zone center. This coupling and
   sensitivity to cell size arises from two basic interactions. Firstly,
   comparatively strong interactions that hold the benzene molecules
   together in layers. These include an intermolecular interaction in which
   H atoms of one molecule link to the center of the aromatic ring of a
   neighboring molecule. The layers are held to each other by weaker
   interactions, which also have components that hold molecules together
   within a layer. Small changes in the lattice parameters change this
   second type of interaction and account for the changes to the lattice
   dynamics. The calculations also reveal a small auxetic effect in that
   elongation of the crystal along the b axis leads to an increase in
   internal pressure in the ac plane, that is, elongation in the b
   direction induces expansion in the a and c directions. (c) 2006 American

   internal contacts is designed. The initial continuum model of a
   noncontact mechanism is converted into a frame model, and possible
   contact links are defined. A computationally efficient algorithm is
   employed to eliminate those mechanisms having overlapping contact links.
   The remaining nonoverlapping designs are exhaustively investigated for
   stress relief. A differential evolution optimizer is used to maximize
   the stress relief. The results generated for a range of specified
   elasticity coefficients include a honeycomb-like cell, an auxetic cell,
   and a diamond-shaped cell. These various cell topologies have different
   effective properties corresponding to different structural requirements.
   For each such topology, a contact mechanism is devised that demonstrates
   stress relief. In one such case, the contact mechanism increases the
   strain magnification ratio by about 30\%. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007694]}},

Title = {{Regional Differences in Cancer Incidence Trend in Tehran, Iran: A
   Contextual Study on the Effect of Socioeconomic Status at Regional Level}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cancer is a major public health concern all over the world.
   The aim of the current study is to demonstrate changing trends of cancer
   incidence from 2006 to 2009 in Tehran (capital city of Iran) and
   evaluate the effect of living in different regions according to their
   median socioeconomic status (SES) on cancer cumulative incidence.
   Methods: The incident cases were obtained from the population based
   cancer register of ministry of health and medicine in Iran; we examined
   the annual percent changes (APCs) and overall trends of total cancer
   incidence across regions in Tehran. The age and sex standardized
   incidence rates were computed by the direct method. Poisson regression
   and negative binominal regression model were used to assess the
   existence of trends across 4 consecutive years, as well as the effect of
   living in each region, literacy rate, and employment rate across regions
   on this trend. All the analyses were done by Stata 12.0 software.
   Results: The findings of this study showed downward and nonlinear trend
   during 4 years. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) was higher in
   men compared to women in this period. ASRs for overall 4 years were 114
   and 101 per 10,0000 men and women, respectively. Average annual percent
   change based on ASR and regression model for each sex was the same and
   around -5\% and -6\%, respectively. Incidence rate also differed between
   districts so that north and center districts had higher incidence than
   southern parts in both sexes. The lowest rate ratio attributed to
   district 17 and 18 located in south of Tehran and the highest rate ratio
   attributed to district 6 for each sex compared to the baseline district
   16. Results reported the sharp increase of 59\% and 37\% in district 6
   compared to district 16 in men and women, respectively. Better regional
   social status increased the risk of cancer among women. Also, the
   results showed a partially significant interaction with higher decrease
   in annual trend of cancer rate in socially more deprived regions.
   Conclusions: The results showed downward and nonlinear decreasing trend
   during 4 years, especially in regions with lower socioeconomic status.
   Incidence rate also differed between districts so that northern regions
   had higher incidence than southern regions. Spatio-temporal Analysis of
   these cancer rates with adjustment for more regional socio-economic
   characteristics may better explain the disparities in rate of cancer in
   different districts across time.}},

Abstract = {{In coming decades, increasing temperatures are expected to impact crop
   yield and seed quality. To develop low input systems, the effects of
   temperature and sulfur (S) nutrition in oilseed rape, a high S demanding

   effects of temperatures {[}High Temperature (HT), 33 degrees C/day, 19
   degrees C/night vs. Control Temperature (Ctrl T), 20 degrees C/day, 15
   degrees C/day] and S supply {[}High S (HS), 500 mu m SO42- vs. Low S
   (LS), 8.7 mu M SO42-] during seed filling on (i) yield components
   {[}seed number, seed dry weight (SDVV) and seed yield], (ii) grain
   composition {[}nitrogen (N) and S contents] and quality {[}fatty acid
   (FA) composition and seed storage protein (SSP) accumulation] and (iii)
   germination characteristics (pre-harvest sprouting, germination rates
   and abnormal seedlings). Abscisic acid (ABA), soluble sugar contents and
   seed conductivity were also measured. HT and LS decreased the number of
   seeds per plant. SDW was less affected due to compensatory effects since
   the number of seeds decreased under stress conditions. While LS had
   negative effects on seed composition by reducing the FA contents and
   increasing the ratio S-poor SSPs (12S globulins)/S-rich SSPs (2S
   albumins) ratio, HT had positive effects by increasing S and FA contents
   and decreasing the C18:2/C18:3 ratio and the 12S/2S protein ratio. Seeds
   produced under HT showed high pre-harvest sprouting rates along with
   decreased ABA contents and high rates of abnormal seedlings. HT and LS
   restriction significantly accelerated germination times. High
   conductivity, which indicates poor seed storage capacity, was higher in
   HT seeds. Consistently, the lower ratio of (raffinose +
   stachyose)/sucrose in HT seeds indicated low seed storage capacity. We
   demonstrated the effects of HT and LS on grain and on germination
   characteristics. These results suggest that hormonal changes might
   control several seed characteristics simultaneously.}},

Title = {{Effect of faults on stress path evolution during reservoir
   pressurization}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{412-430}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Fluid injection operations, such as CO2 storage and enhanced oil
   recovery (EOR), imply reservoir pressurization, which changes the
   effective and total stresses due to poroelastic effects. These stress
   changes control the geo-mechanical stability of discontinuities like
   faults and fractures. Though the effect of these pre-existing
   discontinuities on stress path is sometimes neglected, the stress state
   is altered around them. We investigate the effect of a fault on the
   stress path evolution when pressurizing a reservoir using an in-house
   hybrid FEM-DEM code called ``MDEM{''}. Simulation results indicate that
   the stress path is affected by the presence of faults considered to
   deform elastically, especially in the vicinity of the fault in the
   reservoir-caprock interfaces. The stress path perturbation is caused by
   the shear deformation of the fault plane, which is different in the
   reservoir and the caprock sections. Actually, the magnitude and the
   extension of the stress path perturbation around a fault become larger
   for faults with lower shear stiffness. The upper hanging wall and the
   lower footwall of the fault in the reservoir-caprock interface
   experience a higher stress path in the horizontal and the vertical
   directions. Furthermore, the stress paths decrease (negative in the
   vertical direction) in the upper footwall and the lower hanging wall in
   the reservoir-caprock interfaces. The fault effect on the stress path
   increases as the aspect ratio of the reservoir becomes lower. Moreover,
   the results indicated that both the caprock and the reservoir in the
   footwall experience a greater change for lower Poisson's ratio of the
   caprock.
   These stress changes are independent of the in situ stress regime as
   long as the fault deforms elastically. However, the impact of the stress
   path perturbation on the stability of the reservoir and the caprock is
   different in a compressional (reverse faulting) and an extensional
   (normal faulting) stress regimes. The stress state becomes less stable
   in the vicinity of the fault in the reservoir and in the caprock in a
   compressional stress regime than in an extensional stress regime.
   Therefore, a compressional stress regime leads to a less stable
   situation due to the fault effect on the evolution of the stress path.
   Overall, the presence of faults alters the stress state around them,
   which may lead to a stress state that is closer to failure conditions
   than predicted by models that do not explicitly include faults.}},

Title = {{Does anthropometric status at 6months predict the over-dispersion of
   malaria infections in children aged 6-18months? A prospective cohort
   study}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundIn malaria-endemic settings, a small proportion of children
   suffer repeated malaria infections, contributing to most of the malaria
   cases, yet underlying factors are not fully understood. This study was
   aimed to determine whether undernutrition predicts this over-dispersion
   of malaria infections in children aged 6-18months in settings of high
   malaria and undernutrition prevalence.MethodsProspective cohort study,
   conducted in Mangochi, Malawi. Six-months-old infants were enrolled and
   had length-for-age z-scores (LAZ), weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ), and
   weight-for-length z-scores (WLZ) assessed. Data were collected for
   presumed', clinical, and rapid diagnostic test (RDT)-confirmed malaria
   until 18months. Malaria microscopy was done at 6 and 18months. Negative
   binomial regression was used for malaria incidence and modified Poisson
   regression for malaria prevalence.ResultsOf the 2723 children enrolled,
   2561 (94\%) had anthropometry and malaria data. The mean (standard
   deviation {[}SD]) of LAZ, WAZ, and WLZ at 6months were -1.4 (1.1), -0.7
   (1.2), and 0.3 (1.1), respectively. The mean (SD) incidences of
   presumed', clinical, and RDT-confirmed malaria from 6 to 18months were:
   1.1 (1.6), 0.4 (0.8), and 1.3 (2.0) episodes/year, respectively.
   Prevalence of malaria parasitaemia was 4.8\% at 6months and 9.6\% at
   18months. Higher WLZ at 6months was associated with lower prevalence of
   malaria parasitaemia at 18months (prevalence ratio {[}PR]=0.80, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 0.67 to 0.94, p=0.007), but not with
   incidences of presumed' malaria (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR]=0.97, 95\%
   CI 0.92 to 1.02, p=0.190), clinical malaria (IRR=1.03, 95\% CI 0.94 to
   1.12, p=0.571), RDT-confirmed malaria (IRR=1.00, 95\% CI 0.94 to 1.06,
   p=0.950). LAZ and WAZ at 6months were not associated with malaria
   outcomes. Household assets, maternal education, and food insecurity were
   significantly associated with malaria. There were significant variations
   in hospital-diagnosed malaria by study site.ConclusionIn children aged
   6-18months living in malaria-endemic settings, LAZ, WAZ, and WLZ do not
   predict malaria incidence. However, WLZ may be associated with
   prevalence of malaria. Socio-economic and micro-geographic factors may
   explain the variations in malaria, but these require further study.Trial

Abstract = {{Objective
   To compare clinical features, treatments and outcomes in men with
   non-metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) according to whether they were
   referred for symptoms or elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.
   Patients and Methods
   This study used data from the South Australia Prostate Cancer Clinical
   Outcomes Collaborative database; a multi-institutional clinical registry
   covering both the public and private sectors. We included all
   non-metastatic cases from 1998 to 2013 referred for urinary/prostatic
   symptoms or elevated PSA level. Multivariate Poisson regression was used
   to identify characteristics associated with symptomatic presentation and
   compare treatments according to reason for referral. Outcomes (i.e.
   overall survival, PCa-specific survival, metastasis-free survival and
   disease-free survival) were compared using multivariate Cox proportional
   hazards and competing risk regression.
   Results
   Our analytical cohort consisted of 4 841 men with localized PCa.
   Symptomatic men had lower-risk disease (incidence ratio {[}IR] 0.70,
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.61-0.81 for high vs low risk), fewer
   radical prostatectomies (IR 0.64, CI: 0.56-0.75) and less radiotherapy
   (IR 0.86, CI: 0.77-0.96) than men presenting with elevated PSA level.
   All-cause mortality (hazard ratio {[}HR] 1.31, CI: 1.16-1.47),
   disease-specific mortality (HR 1.42, CI: 1.13-1.77) and risk of
   metastases (HR 1.36, CI: 1.13-1.64) were higher for men presenting with
   symptoms, after adjustment for other clinical characteristics; however,
   risk of disease progression did not differ (HR 0.90, CI: 0.74-1.07)
   amongst those treated curatively. Subgroup analyses indicated poorer PCa
   survival for symptomatic referral among men undergoing radical
   prostatectomy (HR 3.4, CI: 1.3-8.8), those aged >70 years (HR 1.4, CI:
   1.0-1.8), men receiving private treatment (HR 2.1, CI: 1.3-3.3), those
   diagnosed via biopsy (HR 1.3, CI: 1.0-1.7) and those diagnosed before
   2006 (HR 1.6, CI: 1.2-2.7).
   Conclusion
   Our results suggest that symptomatic presentation may be an independent
   negative prognostic indicator for PCa survival. More complete assessment
   of disease grade and extent, more definitive treatment and increased
   post-treatment monitoring among symptomatic cases may improve outcomes.
   Further research to determine any pathophysiological basis for poor
   outcomes in symptomatic men is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Amplitude versus offset AVO analysis and forward modelling were used to
   predict the fluid type and seismic signature in a deep gas reservoir in
   faith field, Niger Delta. Well A, which identified the major deeper gas
   bearing reservoir in this field, was used in the modelling to predict
   what the seismic response would be away from this well at varying
   thickness and porosity ranges. The entire well was blocked into
   alternate layers of sand and shale lithotypes; the sands were fluid
   substituted from its initial in situ condition to 100\% brine
   saturation, and from the brine case, fluid substituted to 100 \% oil and
   100 \% gas saturations. The elastic properties of these fluid
   substituted sands were estimated using the Gassmann equations and Batzle
   and Wang. The results were used in AVO analysis. Seismic forward
   modelling to determine the seismic wiggle signatures of these sands were
   also conducted. The variations of pertinent rock properties with depth
   of burial were also investigated. The results show that sand alpha
   (interval 10,400-10,650 ft) exhibited a typical class 3 AVO signature.
   Seismic wiggle response from top of this sand shows a distinct negative
   trough on the near angle stack and a much larger trough on the far
   stack. Sand beta (interval 11,700-12,050 ft) exhibited a typical class
   2n AVO signature. Sand wedge model response shows increasing amplitudes
   from tops and bases of these sands as a function of thickness with the
   limits of seismic resolution shown by the tuning thickness. The
   gradient-stack plots, Hiltermann's acoustic impedance (HAI) versus
   Poisson's ratio (PR) plots and the AVO models suggest that the
   hydrocarbon-bearing sands will be distinguishable from sands with 100 \%
   brine saturations. There is significant overlap between oil and gas
   plots because the oil was modelled as having a high gas oil ratio (GOR)
   of 3,586. The reservoirs at this level in Faith Field are either
   condensate or gas bearing. Seismic direct hydrocarbon indicator (DHI)
   and lithologic delineation are better defined in the shallower sand
   alpha than the deeper sand beta. These models have shown that any good
   quality seismic acquired over this prospect would be useful in deriving
   reservoir properties from seismic (RPFS) for these reservoirs and would
   be effective in lithologic differentiation or hydrocarbon
   identification.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Prompt linkage to HIV primary care may reduce the need for
   inpatient hospitalization.
   Methods: Retrospective cohort study of South Carolina HIV-infected
   individuals diagnosed from January 1986 to December 2006 who utilized 62
   inpatient facilities from (January 2007 to June 2010). Suboptimal
   primary care engagement was defined as <2 reports of a CD4(+)T-cell
   count or viral load value to surveillance in each calendar year from
   January 2007 to June 2010. Multivariable logistic regression explored
   associations of HIV primary care engagement with inpatient
   hospitalization after accounting for sociodemographic characteristics
   and disease stage. Poisson and negative binominal regression examined
   primary care engagement, sociodemographic characteristics, and disease
   stage on frequency of inpatient hospitalization and total inpatient
   days.
   Results: Individuals presenting to the hospital with an AIDS-defining
   illness had greater risk of suboptimal HIV primary care engagement
   {[}adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.58; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.23
   to 2.04] more inpatient hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] =
   1.74; 95\% CI: 1.65 to 1.83) and inpatient days (IRR = 2.17; 95\% CI:
   2.00 to 2.36). Blacks demonstrated greater suboptimal care risk (aOR =
   1.61; 95\% CI: 1.15 to 2.25), more inpatient visits (IRR = 1.09; 95\%
   CI: 1.01 to 1.17), and inpatient days (IRR = 1.21; 95\% CI: 1.09 to
   1.34). Medicare protected against suboptimal primary care engagement
   (aOR = 0.66; 95\% CI: 0.46 to 0.95) but was associated with more
   hospitalizations (IRR = 1.09; 95\% CI: 1.01 to 1.18). AIDS disease stage
   was associated with decreased suboptimal care risk (AIDS <= 1 year, aOR
   = 0.05; 95\% CI: 0.02 to 0.12; AIDS > 1 year, aOR = 0.11; 95\% CI: 0.06
   to 0.20) but more hospitalizations (AIDS <= 1 year, IRR = 1.12; 95\% CI:
   1.04 to 1.21; AIDS >1 year, IRR = 1.12; 95\% CI: 1.04 to 1.21) and

   >1 year, IRR = 1.35; 95\% CI: 1.21 to 1.50).
   Conclusions: Disease stage, race, and insurance status strongly
   influence HIV primary care engagement and inpatient hospitalization.

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Background The ``failure of success{''} theory predicts that as
   subsequent generations of older adults retain more teeth, those
   additional teeth will experience more oral disease like root surface
   caries. The theory in relation to root surface caries has never been
   tested in a cross-generational study. This study aims to compare root
   surface caries across generations of South Australian older adults to
   test the theory and explore risk indicators for root surface caries.
   Methods Data were from the baseline of two South Australian studies
   separated by 22 years. In both studies, stratified random samples of
   people aged 60+ years from Adelaide and Mount Gambier were recruited.
   Dental examinations were performed by trained and calibrated dentists.
   One of the dental examiners from the earlier study was the gold standard
   examiner in the second study. Risk indicators included behavioural
   factors, clinical oral conditions, sociodemographic and socioeconomic
   status. Root surface caries was assessed as untreated root surface
   caries (root decayed surfaces {[}RDS]), treated root surface caries
   (root filled surfaces {[}RFS]) and treated or untreated root surface
   caries (root decayed and filled surfaces {[}RDFS]) and was presented as
   the prevalence and summed count. Multivariable models for Poisson and
   negative binomial distributions were used to estimate prevalence ratios
   (PR) and mean ratios (MR), respectively, and their 95\% confidence
   intervals (95\% CI). Results The current generation of South Australian
   older adults has significantly lower RDS (PR {[}95\% CI] = 0.65
   {[}0.47-0.89]; MR {[}95\% CI] = 0.51 {[}0.35-0.73]) and RDFS (PR {[}95\%
   CI] = 0.84 {[}0.71-0.99]; MR {[}95\% CI] = 0.76 {[}0.65-0.90]) than the
   previous generation. The RFS in the previous and current generation was
   similar. Gingival recession, irregular brushing, dental visiting for a
   problem and smoking were the indicators for RDS, while age, gingival
   recession, tooth brushing frequency, time since last dental visit and
   reason of visiting were the indicators for RFS or RDFS. Conclusions
   These results do not support the ``failure of success{''} theory in
   relation to root surface caries among South Australian older adults.
   Despite the higher number of teeth retained, the current generation of
   older adults has less root surface caries than the previous generation.
   Behavioural factors remain the indicators of root surface caries across
   the generations.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives This study sought to examine the effect of statin therapy
   hospitalizations for heart failure (HFH) in patients in the CORONA
   (Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure) trial.
   Background HFH is an important, frequently recurrent event. Conventional
   time-to-first event analyses do not take account repeat events. We used
   a number of statistical approaches to examine the effect of treatment on
   first and repeat HFH in the CORONA trial.
   Methods In the CORONA trial, 5,011 patients >= 60 years of age with
   chronic New York Heart Association functional classes II to IV systolic
   heart failure resulting from ischemia were randomized to receive
   rosuvastatin or placebo. Poisson, Andersen-Gill, and negative binomial
   methods (NB) were used to analyze the effect of rosuvastatin on HFH, and
   the NB and a parametric joint frailty model (JF) were used to examine
   this effect while accounting for the competing risk of cardiovascular
   (CV) death. Rosuvastatin/ placebo rate ratios were calculated, both
   unadjusted and adjusted.
   Results A total of 1,291 patients had 1 or more HFH (750 of these had a
   single HFH only), and there were a total of 2,408 HFHs. The hazard ratio
   for the conventional time-to-first event analysis for HFH was 0.91 (95\%
   confidence interval {[} CI]: 0.82 to 1.02, p = 0.105). In contrast, the
   NB on repeat hospitalizations gave an unadjusted RR (RR) for HFH of 0.86
   (95\% CI: 0.75 to 0.99, p = 0.030), adjusted 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.72 to
   0.92, p = 0.001), and after including CV death as the last event,
   adjusted RR of 0.85 (95\% CI: 0.77 to 0.94, p = 0.001). The JF gave an
   adjusted RR of 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.73 to 0.92, p = 0.001). Similar results
   were found in analyses of all CV hospitalizations and all-cause
   hospitalizations.
   Conclusions When repeat events were included, rosuvastatin was shown to
   reduce the risk of HFH by approximately 15\% to 20\%, equating to
   approximately 76 fewer admissions per 1,000 patients treated over a
   median 33 months of follow-up. Including repeat events could increase
   the ability to detect treatment effects in heart failure trials. (J Am

Abstract = {{Our aim is to estimate regional mechanical properties of the annulus
   fibrosus (AF) using a multi-relaxation tensile test and to examine the
   relevance of using the transverse dilatations in the identification
   procedure. We collected twenty traction specimens from both outer (n =
   10) and inner (n = 10) sites of the anterior quadrant of the annulus
   fibmsus of one pig spine. A 1-h multi-relaxation tensile test in the
   circumferential direction allowed us to measure the force in the
   direction of traction and the dilatations in all three directions. We
   performed a specific-sample finite element inverse analysis to identify
   variations, along the radial position, of material and structural
   parameters of a hyperelastic compressible and anisotropic constitutive
   law. Our experimental results reveal that the outer sites are subjected
   to a significantly greater stress than the inner sites and that both
   sites exhibit an auxetic behavior. Our numerical results suggest that
   the inhomogeneous behavior arises from significant variations of the
   fiber angle taken into account within the hyperelastic constitutive law.
   In addition, we found that the use of the measured transverse
   dilatations in the identification procedure had a strong impact on the
   identified mechanical parameters. This pilot study suggests that, in
   quasi-static conditions, the annulus fibrosus may be modeled by a
   hyperelastic compressible and anisotropic law with a fiber angle
   gradient from inner to outer periphery.}},

Abstract = {{Filling a non-conducting soft matrix with a hard conducting phase leads
   to two critical transitions: a percolation threshold with a drastic
   increase in conductivity and a rigidity threshold marking a substantial
   increase in the elastic modulus. A metal-particulate polymer composite
   has interpenetrating phases with substantial rigidity beyond the
   rigidity threshold. Experimental results show that the Young's modulus
   of the composite is enhanced significantly when an entrapped
   incompressible polymer phase exerts high hydrostatic stresses in
   uniaxial compression at the rigidity threshold. Additional experiments
   beyond the glass transition temperature of the polymer reveal a
   substantial reduction in the modulus of the composite at the rigidity
   threshold, as the polymer compressibility is increased significantly,
   confirming the role of the soft phase in rigidity enhancements. The
   present investigation provides a potential new designing criterion for
   enhancing the Young's modulus of an interpenetrating composite
   structure, by utilizing an incompressible second phase and negative
   volumetric strain.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To compare the adherence and biofilm formation of
   Staphylococcus epidermidis under in vitro flow conditions on intraocular
   lenses (IOLs) made of 4 biomaterials: poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),
   silicone, hydrophilic acrylic, and hydrophobic acrylic.
   SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Croix-Rousse University Hospital
   and University Research Laboratory, Lyon, France.
   METHODS: Intraocular lenses were placed in a bioreactor designed to
   replicate intraocular conditions. The model consisted of Tygon tubing
   connected to a vial. Three septa allowed the entry and elimination of
   the artificial aqueous humor and inoculation of the bacterial
   suspension. The first of 2 pumps moved the aqueous humor along the
   circuit; the second pump regulated the flow at which the nutritive
   environment was regenerated. At various times (12, 16, 24, 40, 48, 60,
   and 72 hours), IOLs were taken from this environment and the bound
   bacteria were removed and counted. The distribution of bacterial
   adhesion on the IOLs was modeled using polynomial Poisson regression. To
   test the effect of the IOL biomaterial on bacterial adhesion, likelihood
   ratio tests were performed.
   RESULTS: The model provided the kinetics of S epidermidis biofilm growth
   on IOLs. The biofilm growth on each of the 4 biomaterials occurred in 3
   phases: latent, dynamic or accelerated growth, and linear growth. The
   extent of bacterial binding to IOLs increased from hydrophilic acrylic
   polymer to PMMA, hydrophobic acrylic, and silicone. The differences were
   statistically significant.
   CONCLUSION: Bacterial adhesion to and biofilm development on the IOL
   surface depended on the characteristics of the biomaterial.}},

Abstract = {{Background. We estimated the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of
   tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) for preventing
   pertussis among adolescents during a statewide outbreak of pertussis in
   Wisconsin during 2012.
   Methods. We used the population-based Wisconsin Immunization Registry
   (WIR) to construct a cohort of Wisconsin residents born during 1998-2000
   and collect Tdap vaccination histories. Reports of laboratory-confirmed
   pertussis with onset during 2012 were matched to WIR clients. Incidence
   rate ratios (IRRs) of pertussis and Tdap VE estimates {[}(1 -
   IRR){*}100\%], by year of Tdap vaccine receipt and brand
   (Boostrix/Adacel), were estimated using Poisson regression.
   Results. Tdap VE decreased with increasing time since receipt, with VEs
   of 75.3\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 55.2\%-86.5\%) for receipt
   during 2012, 68.2\% (95\% CI, 60.9\%-74.1\%) for receipt during 2011,
   34.5\% (95\% CI, 19.9\%-46.4\%) for receipt during 2010, and 11.9\%
   (95\% CI, -11.1\% to 30.1\%) for receipt during 2009/2008; point
   estimates were higher among Boostrix recipients than among Adacel
   recipients. Among Tdap recipients, increasing time since receipt was
   associated with increased risk, and receipt of Boostrix (vs Adacel) was
   associated with decreased risk of pertussis (adjusted IRR, 0.62 {[}95\%
   CI, .52-.74]).
   Conclusions. Our results demonstrate waning immunity following
   vaccination with either Tdap brand. Boostrix was more effective than
   Adacel in preventing pertussis in our cohort, but these findings may not
   be generalizable to adolescent cohorts that received different
   diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccines (DTaP) during childhood
   and should be further examined in studies that include childhood DTaP
   history.}},

Abstract = {{Borophene is an auxetic and ferroelectric material which can be combined
   with graphene and other 2D materials and also has application in
   batteries. All these features attracted researchers to study this 2D
   material. Recently, several experimental works have been done and long
   defects such as incompletely resolved edges (chain-like boundaries) were
   recognized in borophene sheets. Since chain-like boundaries increase the
   number of free atoms on the surface of 2D materials, this cause
   promotion of their properties. In this paper, effect of geometrical
   parameters of chain-like boundaries on mechanical properties of
   single-layer borophene sheets is studied. Length, angle and repetition
   of the pattern of chain-like boundaries are measured. In general,
   increasing the width of line defect, the fracture stress, fracture
   strain and modulus of elasticity decrease. It was observed that
   repetition of the patterns along the direction of chain-like boundaries
   has an insignificant effect on mechanical properties. As a key result,
   the self-healing phenomena was observed for some special conditions. It
   is concluded that elongation to a certain extent leads to self-healing
   of borophene sheets with chain-like boundaries. The obtained results by
   this study might be useful for rebuilding some especial configurations
   based on linearly defected borophene sheets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Wearable electronic devices have become familiar to people and have been
   expanded to various functions via development in the field of the
   flexible and stretchable electronic devices. These wearable devices,
   such as displays, motion sensors, electromyography sensors, and
   electrocardiogram sensors, require input and power systems to command
   information and supply energy, respectively. The triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG) has attracted attention as an eco-friendly device
   that provides sustainable power without an external power supply. Here,
   we report a self-powered stretchable TENG (S-TENG) touch sensor suitable
   for a wearable device that adapts to the skin's motion because of its
   stretchability. The S-TENG with a single-electrode structure was
   fabricated using atomically thin graphene (< 1 nm), polyethylene
   terephthalate (similar to 5 mu m), and polydimethylsiloxane (similar to
   5 mu m) as the electrode, substrate, and electrification layer,
   respectively. The stretchability was realized through an auxetic mesh
   design, which helps to obtain stable mechanical and electrical
   properties while stretching. The S-TENG touch sensor not only senses the
   touch point but can also perform improved extended functions such as
   detection of touch sliding velocity and information input through the
   trajectory mode. The developed S-TENG touch sensor showed good potential
   for future wearable input applications and is capable of long-term
   performance without an energy supply.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied the electroosmotic flow (EOF) and its effect through a
   polyelectrolyte coated conical nanopore. The nanopore wall bears a
   uniform negative surface charge while charged density of the
   polyelectrolyte layer (PEL) bears positive charge. The degree of
   softness in the PEL is mainly affects the hydrodynamic field inside the
   nanopore while ionic current is not affected significantly by flow
   field. The characteristic of electrokinetic flow is based on the
   nonlinear Nernst-Planck equations for the ion transport coupled with the
   Brinkman extended Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow and the Poisson
   equation for induced electric potential. The coupled set of governing
   nonlinear equations for fluid flow and ionic species concentration are
   solved through a finite volume method on a staggered grid system. A
   numerical method based on the pressure correction iterative algorithm is
   adopted to compute the flow field. This study investigated the
   importance of the bulk concentration of the electrolyte, the geometries
   of the nanopore and both the thickness and the charged density of PEL on
   the electrokinetic ion and fluid transport. The ratio of the
   cross-sectional average flow of the present model with plane cylindrical
   channel, decreases with the increase of the scaled charge density of PEL
   for both low and high ionic concentration cases when softness parameter
   and thickness of PEL are fixed. The average flow rate decreases with the
   increase of the PEL sealed charge density in both low and high ionic
   concentration cases for fixed PEL thickness. The increase of nanopore
   radius increases the cross sectional averaged flow for fixed scaled
   charged density and PEL thickness. The average flow rate decreases with
   the increase of the PEL thickness for fixed charged density of PEL. The
   critical value of scaled charge density of PEL is defined for which
   there is no flow through the nanopore. The average current density
   increases with the increase of applied electric field for different
   charged density of PEL. But there is no different of average current
   density for different charge density of PEL in high ionic concentration
   cases.}},

Abstract = {{Meta-materials are a class of artificial materials with a wide range of
   bulk properties that are different from the base material they are made
   of The term meta-material in the context of this research refers to a
   continuous, heterogeneous structure with prescribed elastic properties.
   Such meta-materials are designed using Topology Optimization (TO). Tools
   like SIMP interpolation, mesh filtering and continuation methods are
   used to address the numerical issues with Topology Optimization.
   In a previous research {[}1], by offsetting meta-material layers by a
   half-width of the Unit Cell, an auxetic honeycomb-like geometry was
   obtained. This was the first time such a shape was observed as the
   result of Topology Optimization targeting the effective shear modulus
   using square Unit Cells. This was obtained while designing the shear
   beam of a non-pneumatic wheel.
   This research studies the design of meta-materials using offsets other
   than zero or half-widths. The same problem {[}1] was solved for
   different values of offset, and the obtained geometries and volume
   fractions are studied. It is concluded that it may be beneficial for
   designers to consider offsetting meta-material layers with offsets other
   than half-width, to design novel, potentially better performing
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{The ground state of macroscopic samples of magnetically ordered
   materials is a domain state because of magnetostatic energy or entropy,
   yet we have limited experimental means for imaging the bulk domain
   structure and the magnetization process directly. The common methods
   available reveal the domains at the surface or in electron-or x-ray
   transparent lamellae, not those in the bulk. The magnetization curve
   just reflects the vector sum of the moments of all the domains in the
   sample, butmagnetostriction curves are more informative. They are
   strongly influenced by the domain structure in the unmagnetized state
   and its evolution during the magnetization process in an applied field.
   Here we report a method of determining the bulk domain structure in a
   cubic magnetostrictive material by combining magneto-optic Kerr
   microscopy with magnetostriction and magnetization measurements on
   single crystals as a function of applied field. We analyze the
   magnetostriction of Fe83Ga17 crystals in terms of a domain structure
   that is greatly influenced by sample shape and heat treatment.
   Saturation magnetostriction measurements are used to determine the
   fraction of domains orientated along the three  100  axes in the initial
   state. Domain wall motion and rotation process have characteristic
   signatures in the magnetostriction curves, including those associated
   with the Delta E effect and domain rotation through a  110  auxetic
   direction.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed at investigating how ice templating conditions affected
   the shrinkage, the microstructure, and the mechanical properties of
   cellulose nanofibril (NFC) foams. Enzymatic and TEMPO-oxidized NFC foams
   were fabricated using two solidification techniques, i.e., quenching NFC
   suspensions in temperature-controlled baths, and mechanical stirring of
   NFC suspensions during solidification followed by quenching, prior to
   freeze-drying. Foams prepared by direct quenching using stabilized
   TEMPO-oxidized NFC suspensions exhibited higher specific mechanical
   properties and more regular anisotropic cells with unimodal size than
   enzymatic NFC foams. In addition, NFC concentration and NFC morphology
   severely affected the foam shrinkage and the geometry of foam cells.
   Controlling the solidification had also a drastic effect on the foam
   microstructure, e.g. foams prepared by mechanical stirring and quenching
   exhibited bimodal cell size and enhanced mechanical properties. The
   compressive behavior of foams showed successive elastic,
   strain-hardening and densification regimes with auxetic effects and
   strain localization. Both the elastic modulus and the yield stress were
   power-law functions of the foam relative density whose exponents reached
   unusual high values for enzymatic NFC foams, potentially because of
   their chaotic microstructures. The evolution of a typical TEMPO-oxidized
   NFC foam was studied under compression using X-ray microtomography,
   unveiling deformation mechanisms at the cell scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background. Although superior vena cava (SVC) stenosis may be a
   life-threatening complication of haemodialysis (HD) catheters, its
   prevalence and risk factors in HD patients are unknown. Our aim was to
   assess the prevalence and risk factors for SVC stenosis in HD patients
   with a tunnelled cuffed catheter (TCC) and to describe its clinical
   presentation.
   Methods. In this single-centre, retrospective cohort study, all
   in-centre chronic HD patients carrying a TCC (1 January 2008-31 December
   2012) were included (n = 117 patients, 214 TCC, 80 911 catheter-days).
   SVC stenosis was defined as a diameter reduction >50\% on phlebography
   or computed tomography. Imaging was triggered by clinical SVC stenosis
   syndrome or vascular access (VA)-related concerns. We recorded
   demographics, conditions potentially influencing catheter permeability
   (medications, carriage of thoracic devices), number of TCCs, total
   duration of TCC carriage, previous arteriovenous VA and last (in use at
   time of stenosis detection) TCC details (location, diameter and length).
   VAs created while a TCC was still used were also recorded.
   Results. An SVC stenosis was found in 11 patients (9.4\%, 0.14/1000
   catheter-days), which represents almost one-quarter of patients
   undergoing imaging, whatever the cause (11/45). Only two presented with
   clinically obvious SVC stenosis. The number of TCCs per patient was 2.64
   +/- 1.8 in the SVC stenosis group versus 1.75 +/- 0.94 in the negative
   group (P = 0.13). On multivariate analysis (Poisson), diabetes
   \{incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] 4.63 {[}confidence interval (CI)
   1.2-17.8]; P = 0.02\} and total duration of TCC carriage {[}IRR 1.47 (CI
   1.2-1.8) per year; P = 0.001] were associated with SVC stenosis, whereas
   age had a slightly protective effect {[}IRR 0.96 (CI 0.91-1.01); P =
   0.01]. Limitations are the retrospective design, detection and survivor
   bias.
   Conclusion. SVC stenosis is not a rare condition, is mostly asymptomatic
   in the absence of a peripheral VA, is strongly associated with diabetes
   and is promoted by long TCC carriage. Age is slightly protective.}},

Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and factors associated with
   cost-related underuse of medications in a nationally representative
   sample of Brazilians aged 50 years and over.
   METHODS: Among the 9,412 participants of the Brazilian Longitudinal
   Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), 6,014 reported using at least one
   medication on regular basis and were included in the analysis. Underuse
   of medications was by stopping taking or reducing the number of tablets
   or the dose of any prescribed medication for financial reasons. The
   theoretical framework used for the selection of the exploratory
   variables included predisposing factors, enabling factors, and factors
   of need. Associations were tested by Poisson regression.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of underuse of medications was 10.6\%. After
   adjustments for relevant covariables, positive and statistically
   significant associations (p < 0.05) with the outcome were found for
   females {[}prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.39], sufficiency of the family
   income for expenses (PR = 1.74 for sometimes and PR 2.42 for never),
   frequency with which the physician explains about the disease and
   treatment (PR = 1.31 for rarely or never), number of medications used
   (PR = 1.39 for 2-4 and 1.53 for 5 or more), fair (PR = 2.02) and poor or
   very poor self-rated health (PR = 2.92), and a previous medical
   diagnosis of depression (PR = 1.69). Negative associations were observed
   for the age groups of 60-79 years (PR = 0.75) and 80 years and over (PR
   = 0.43), socioeconomic status of the household (PR = 0.70, 0.79, and
   0.60 for the second, third, and fourth quartile, respectively), and
   private health plan coverage (PR = 0.79). There were no associations
   between hypertension and self-reported diabetes and underuse of
   medications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cost-related underuse of medications is multidimensional
   and complex, and it covers socio-demographic characteristics, health
   conditions, and the use of health services. The explanation about the
   disease and its treatment to the patient and the expansion of the
   universal access to pharmaceutical care can minimize the risks of
   underuse.}},

Abstract = {{Electrokinetic peristaltic multi-layered transport is considered in a
   micro-channel under the action of an axial electrical field. Three
   different layers i.e. the core layer, intermediate layer and peripheral
   layer are simulated with three different viscosities for each fluid
   layer. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and
   momentum with electrokinetic body forces, are transformed from the wave
   frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms are
   rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann
   equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst-Planck equation.
   The dimensionless emerging linearized electrokinetic boundary value
   problem is solved using integral methods. Closed-form expressions are
   derived for stream functions in the core, intermediate and peripheral
   layers. Expressions are also derived for the core-intermediate interface
   shape and the intermediate-peripheral interface shape. Maximum pressures
   are also computed. To study bolus migration, the range of the trapping
   limit is also determined in the peripheral layer. It is found that in
   the core layer larger boluses are computed in the case of lower
   intermediate layer viscosity relative to peripheral layer viscosity
   although the number of boluses is greater when the intermediate layer
   viscosity exceeds the peripheral layer viscosity. Furthermore, in the
   intermediate layer, stronger concentration of streamlines is computed in
   the lower half space with positive Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity. Also
   negative Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity reduces the core layer (H-1)
   interface shape whereas it enhances the peripheral layer (H) and
   intermediate layer (H-2) shapes. At lower values of volume flow rate
   ratio, hydromechanical efficiency is maximum for positive
   Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity whether intermediate layer viscosity is
   less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. Finally, greater with
   greater peristaltic wave amplitude and also for positive
   Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity there is an increase in time-averaged
   flow rate, whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than
   peripheral layer viscosity. The analysis is relevant to electro-kinetic
   hemodynamics and bio-micro-fluidics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{Background: HIV infection in gay and bisexually active men (GBM) is an
   international public health concern and increasing HIV testing frequency
   is an important prevention goal. In this study we assessed the effect of
   introducing the Xpress clinic on repeat HIV testing in high-risk GBM in
   Sydney, Australia. Methods: The study population consisted of
   higher-risk (>5 male partners in the preceding 3 months) HIV-negative
   GBM attending the Sydney Sexual Health Centre for HIV screening between
   1 October 2009 and 31 December 2013 (12 months before Xpress was
   introduced and 3 years after). Poisson regression models were used to
   calculate the average annual trend of retesting within 6 months by
   quarter, and a retrospective cohort was constructed in which
   multivariate regression methods were used to assess the association
   between attendance at the Xpress clinic and repeat HIV testing in 6
   months. Results: Among high-risk GBM, HIV retesting increased from 32\%
   in Quarter 1 of 2011 to 48\% in Quarter 4 of 2013 (P-trend < 0.001).
   There was no significant trend in the proportion of high-risk GBM
   retesting within 6 months by quarter in the period before Xpress (1
   October 2009-30 September 2010; P-trend = 0.69), but there was a
   significant upward trend after Xpress implementation (1 January 2011-31
   December 2013; P-trend < 0.001). The summary rate ratio in the before
   versus during Xpress period in all GBM was 1.27 (95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 1.15-1.40; P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis,
   attending the Xpress clinic was independently associated with retesting
   within 6 months of an initial test (adjusted OR 2.78; 95\% CI 2.12-3.66;
   P < 0.001) after adjusting for other demographics and risk factors.
   Conclusions: This study consistently shows that optimising current
   services by introducing express clinics was able to increase HIV testing
   frequency in high-risk GBM and should be adopted more widely.}},

Title = {{Retrospective cohort study of the association between maternal

Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   To investigate the association between maternal employment precarity and
   infant low birth weight (LBW), and to assess if this association differs
   by race/ethnicity.
   Methods
   Data were collected from 2871 women enrolled in the National
   Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the National Longitudinal Survey
   of Youth 1979 Children and Young Adult Cohort. Employment precarity was
   evaluated using a summary variable that combined several employment
   attributes: availability of employer-sponsored insurance, income, long
   shifts, non-daytime shifts, availability of employer sponsored training
   or educational benefits and membership in a union or collective
   bargaining unit. Employment precarity scores (a sum of the number of
   negative employment attributes) were categorised into low (0-2), medium
   (3) and high (4-6). LBW was defined as weight less than 2500 g at birth.
   Modified Poisson models were fit to calculate risk ratios and 95\% CIs
   and adjusted for maternal age, race/ethnicity, educational attainment,
   nativity, prepregnancy body mass index, alcohol consumption, smoking
   during pregnancy and infant year of birth. We assessed effect
   modification by maternal race/ethnicity using a composite exposure-race
   variable.
   Results
   Women with high employment precarity had higher risk of a LBW delivery
   compared with women with low employment precarity (RR: 1.48, 95\% CI:
   1.11 to 1.98). Compared to non-Hispanic/non-black women with low
   employment precarity, non-Hispanic black women (RR: 2.68; 95\% CI: 1.72
   to 4.15), Hispanic women (RR: 2.53; 95\% CI: 1.54 to 4.16) and
   non-Hispanic/non-black women (RR: 1.46; 95\% CI: 0.98 to 2.16) with high
   employment precarity had higher risk of LBW.
   Conclusions
   We observed higher risk of LBW in pregnancies of women with high
   employment precarity; this association was stronger among black and
   Hispanic mothers compared to non-Hispanic/non-black women. Findings of
   this study can be used to inform antenatal care and identify workplace
   policies to better support women who work during pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To investigate whether oral health literacy (OHL) impacts
   missing data obtained through self-reporting in oral health
   epidemiological research. Methods Results A cross-sectional study was
   conducted with parents (n = 344) of 4- to 5-year-old children randomly
   selected from public schools within the city of Curitiba, Brazil.
   Parental OHL was measured using the Brazilian version of the Rapid
   Estimate of Adult Literacy in Dentistry (BREALD-30). Parents answered a
   set of questionnaires comprising 88 items concerning sociodemographic
   and economic data, children's access to dental services, oral hygiene
   behaviour, diet and mealtime behaviour. The total number of unanswered
   items (TUI) and the number of unanswered items in each type of question
   (open-ended, dichotomous, multiple choice with up to 4 options and with
   5-9 options) for each participant was compared across different levels
   of OHL (chi-squared, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman's
   correlation test). Multiple Poisson regression was used to estimate rate
   ratios (RR) of TUI between OHL scores and their respective 95\%
   confidence interval (95\% CI). Approximately one-third of studied
   parents (37\%) exhibited low OHL (BREALD-30 <= 21). The prevalence of
   missing data in at least one item was 85.5\%. Low OHL was associated
   with failing to respond open-ended items (P = 0.003) and multiple-choice
   items with up to 4 (P = 0.003) and between 5 and 9 options (P = 0.030).
   There was a negative correlation between OHL scores and TUI (r = -0.195;
   P < 0.001), as well as with the number of unanswered items in all types
   of questions (P < 0.01), except dichotomous questions. Parents with
   lower OHL were more likely to show higher values of TUI (RR 0.95:
   0.93-0.98), when adjusted by income and education. Conclusions
   Participants with lower OHL were significantly more likely to fail to
   complete research questionnaires. The impact of OHL on missing data was
   greater with more complex types of items.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) may interfere with replication
   of hepatitis B virus (HBV), raising the hypothesis that HBV infection
   might be prevented by ART. We investigated the incidence and risk
   factors associated with HBV among HIV-infected adults in Rakai, Uganda.
   Methods: We screened stored sera from 944 HIV-infected adults enrolled
   in the Rakai Community Cohort Study between September 2003 and March
   2015 for evidence of HBV exposure. Serum from participants who tested
   anti-hepatitis B core-negative (497) at baseline were tested over 3-7
   consecutive survey rounds for incident HBV. Poisson incidence methods
   were used to estimate incidence of HBV with 95\% confidence intervals
   (CIs), whereas Cox proportional regression methods were used to estimate
   hazard ratios (HRs).
   Results: Thirty-nine HBV infections occurred over 3342 person-years,
   incidence 1.17/ 100 person-years. HBVincidence was significantly lower
   with ARTuse: 0.49/100 personyears with ART and 2.3/100 person-years
   without ART {[}adjusted HR (aHR) 0.25, 95\% CI 0.1-0.5, P<0.001], and
   with lamivudine (3TC) use: 0.58/100 person-years) with 3TC and 2.25/100
   person-years without 3TC (aHR 0.32, 95\% CI 0.1-0.7, P = < 0.007). No
   new HBV infections occurred among those on tenofovir-based ART. HBV
   incidence also decreased with HIV RNA suppression: 0.6/100 person-years
   with 400 copies/ml or less and 4.0/100 person-years with more than 400
   copies/ml (aHR, 6.4, 95\% CI 2.2-19.0, P< 0.001); and with age: 15-29
   years versus 40-50 years (aHR 3.2, 95\% CI 1.2-9.0); 30-39 years versus
   40-50 years (aHR 2.1, 95\% CI 0.9-5.3).
   Conclusion: HBV continues to be acquired in adulthood among HIV-positive
   Ugandans and HBV incidence is dramatically reduced with HBV-active ART.
   In addition to widespread vaccination, initiation of ART may prevent HBV
   acquisition among HIV-positive adults in sub-Saharan Africa. Copyright

Title = {{Antenatal depressive symptoms and maternal health care utilisation: a
   population-based study of pregnant women in Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Depressive symptoms during pregnancy can have multiple
   adverse effects on perinatal outcomes, including maternal morbidity and
   mortality. The potential impact of antenatal depressive symptoms on
   maternal health care use, however, has been little explored in low and
   middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper investigates whether
   maternal health care utilisation varies as a function of antenatal
   depressive symptoms.
   Methods: In a population-based cross-sectional survey, 1311 women in the
   second or third trimesters of pregnancy were recruited in Sodo district,
   Gurage Zone, southern Ethiopia. Depressive symptoms were measured using
   a locally validated version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).
   The association between antenatal depressive symptoms and number of
   antenatal care (ANC) visits was examined using Poisson regression and
   the association of depression symptoms with emergency health care visits
   using negative binomial regression. Binary logistic regression was used
   to investigate the association of depressive symptoms with initiation,
   frequency and adequacy of antenatal care.
   Results: At PHQ-9 cut off of five or more, 29.5 \% of participants had
   depressive symptoms. The majority (60.5 \%) of women had attended for
   one or more ANC visits. Women with depressive symptoms had an increased
   risk of having more non-scheduled ANC visits (adjusted Risk Ratio (aRR)
   = 1.41, 95 \% CI: 1.20, 1.65), as well as an increased number of
   emergency health care visits to both traditional providers (aRR = 1.64,
   95 \% CI: 1.17, 2.31) and biomedical providers (aRR = 1.31, 95 \% CI:
   1.04, 1.69) for pregnancy-related emergencies. However, antenatal
   depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with initiation of
   ANC.
   Conclusions: Increased non-scheduled ANC and emergency health care
   visits may be indicators of undetected depression in antenatal women,
   and have the potential to overwhelm the capacity and resources of health
   care systems, particularly in LMICs. Establishment of a system for
   detection, referral and treatment of antenatal depression, integrated
   within existing antenatal care, may reduce antenatal morbidity and
   treatment costs and promote efficiency of the health care system.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a major
   threat to human life around the world. This study aims to assess the
   knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19 among people with
   chronic diseases at the outpatient departments in Ho Chi Minh City.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out between February and
   March 2020 using a convenience sampling strategy in three hospitals in
   Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) via the use of a structured self-administered
   questionnaire. Factors relating to practices, prevalence ratio (PR), and
   95\% confidence interval were estimated by using the Poisson regression
   with robust options. P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically
   different.
   Results: A total of 522 participants had a mean age of 51.5 +/- 10.6
   years. Most of them reported seeing information regarding the COVID-19
   pandemic (93.7\%) via television and social media (72.8\% and 62.1\%,
   respectively). Just over two-thirds of the participants (68.4\%)
   answered with sufficient knowledge of COVID-19. Most respondents had a
   positive attitude toward COVID-19 (90.8\%), although some misconceptions
   existed. Almost over three-fourths of them (77.2\%) maintained good
   practices for prevention. The rate of good practices in those who had
   sufficient knowledge was 1.24 times greater than that among those who
   had insufficient knowledge (PR 1.24, 95\% CI: 1.10-1.41, P<0.05). Also,
   the rate of good practices in males was lower than that of females (PR:
   0.91, 95\% CI: 0.83-0.99, P<0.05).
   Conclusion: There still exists an amount of insufficient knowledge and
   negative attitude regarding COVID-19, which may be barriers to good
   prevention practices among chronic illness patients. Education programs
   need to continue via television and social media and emphasize that
   people with chronic diseases are more likely to experience severe
   symptoms, including death from COVID-19. Additionally, management
   authorities should prolong specific policies to protect the more
   vulnerable in our community.}},

Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Little is known about outpatient health services use following critical
   illness and intensive care. We examined the association of intensive
   care with outpatient consultations and quality of life in a
   population-based sample.
   Methods
   Cross-sectional analysis of data from 6,686 participants of the Study of
   Health in Pomerania (SHIP), which consists of two independent
   population-based cohorts. Statistical modeling was done using Poisson
   regression, negative binomial and generalized linear models for
   consultations, and a fractional response model for quality of life
   (EQ-5D-3L index value), with results expressed as prevalence ratios (PR)
   or percent change (PC). Entropy balancing was used to adjust for
   observed confounding.
   Results
   ICU treatment in the previous year was reported by 139 of 6,686 (2,1\%)
   participants, and was associated with a higher probability (PR 1.05
   {[}CI:1.03;1.07]), number (PC +58.0\% {[}CI:22.8;103.2]) and costs (PC
   +64.1\% {[}CI:32.0;103.9]) of annual outpatient consultations, as well
   as with a higher number of medications (PC +37.8\% {[}CI:17.7;61.5]).
   Participants with ICU treatment were more likely to visit a specialist
   (PR 1.13 {[}CI:1.09; 1.16]), specifically internal medicine (PR 1.67
   {[}CI:1.45;1.92]), surgery (PR 2.42 {[}CI:1.92;3.05]), psychiatry (PR
   2.25 {[}CI:1.30;3.90]), and orthopedics (PR 1.54 {[}CI:1.11;2.14]).
   There was no significant effect regarding general practitioner
   consultations. ICU treatment was also associated with lower
   health-related quality of life (EQ-5D index value: PC -13.7\%
   {[}CI:-27.0;-0.3]). Furthermore, quality of life was inversely
   associated with outpatient consultations in the previous month, more so
   for participants with ICU treatment.
   Conclusions
   Our findings suggest that ICU treatment is associated with an increased
   utilization of outpatient specialist services, higher medication intake,
   and impaired quality of life.}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To examine factors associated with perception of work ability
   in a nationally representative sample of Brazilians aged 50 years and
   over.
   METHODS: We used data from 8,903 participants of the baseline survey of
   the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil). The dependent
   variable was self-rated work ability (good or very good versus fair,
   poor, or very poor). Independent variables included factors that operate
   at the beginning, middle, and current stage of life. Multivariate
   analysis was based on prevalence ratios (PR) and 95\% confidence
   intervals (95\% CI) estimated by Poisson regression.
   RESULTS: Good work ability was reported by 49\% of \textbackslash{}
   participants (49.4\% among men and 48.6\% among women). Results of the
   multivariate analysis showed that, for both men and women, good work
   ability showed positive and statistically significant associations (p <
   0.05) with good health up to 15 years of age (PR = 1.22 and 1.18,
   respectively), educational level >= 8 years (PR = 1.19 and 1.21,
   respectively), and current good self-rated health (PR = 1.88 and 1.94,
   respectively). Negative associations were observed for current age (PR =
   0.99 for each increase of one year among men and women), medical
   diagnosis of depression (PR = 0.70 for men and PR = 0.87 for women), and
   having one or more at least chronic diseases (PR = 0.88 for men and 0.91
   for women). Only for men, positive associations for the age at which
   they started working (PR = 1.14 and 1.12 for 11-17 and = 18 years,
   respectively) and living with a spouse (PR = 1.09) were found.
   CONCLUSIONS: Work ability in older ages is built over the life course,
   particularly by the health conditions in childhood and adolescence, age
   at which men begin working, educational level, and health conditions in
   older ages. Policies aimed at increasing longevity in the labor market
   must take these factors into account.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Policing involves inherent physical and psychological
   dangers as well as occupational stressors that could lead to chronic
   fatigue. Although accounts of adverse events associated with police
   fatigue are not scarce, literature on the association between chronic
   fatigue and on-duty injury are limited. Methods: Participants were
   officers from the Buffalo Cardio-Metabolic Occupational Police Stress
   (BCOPS) Study. A 10-item questionnaire was administered to assess how
   tired or energetic the officers generally felt irrespective of sleep
   hours or workload. The questionnaire consisted of five positively worded
   and five negatively phrased items that measured feelings of vigor/energy
   and tiredness, respectively. Total as well as separate scores for
   positive and negative items were computed by summing scores of
   individual items. Payroll records documenting each officer's work
   history were used to assess occurrence of injury. Poisson regression was
   used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) of injury. Results: Nearly 40\%
   of officers reported feeling drained. Overall prevalence of on-duty
   injury during the past year was 23.9\%. Injury prevalence showed a
   significant increasing trend across tertiles of total fatigue score:
   19.6, 21.7, and 30.8\% for lowest, middle and highest tertiles,
   respectively (trend p-value = 0.037). After controlling for potential
   confounders, a 5-unit increase in total fatigue score Was associated
   with a 12\% increase in prevalence of injury which was marginally
   significant (p = 0.075). A 5-tinit increase in fatigue score of the
   positively worded items was associated with a 33\% increase in
   prevalence of injury (PR = 1.33, 95\% CI: 1.04-1.70, p = 0.022).
   Conclusion: Officers who do not feel active, full of vigor, alert, or
   lively had a significantly higher prevalence of non-fatal work place
   injury compared to their counter parts. Practical applications: With
   additional prospective evidence, workplace interventions designed to
   enhance level of energy may reduce feelings of tiredness and hence may
   prevent workplace injury. Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of

Abstract = {{When network station spacing is large relative to event depths,
   constraining focal depths using direct arrivals is difficult. To help
   overcome this problem, we incorporated the SzS, SzP, and PzP Socorro
   magma body reflections into the earthquake location process. To find a
   velocity model appropriate for combining direct and reflected arrivals,
   we jointly inverted for 75 hypocenters and a one-dimensional velocity
   model. We used over 1000 direct arrivals and over 400 reflected
   arrivals, solving for P velocity (Vp) and Poisson's ratio (nu) above the
   approximate base of the seismogenic zone, Vp and nu below the base of
   the seismogenic zone, depth to the upper surface of the magma body, and
   station corrections. High-velocity and low-velocity initial models
   converged to the same solutions without damping. We found that Vp and nu
   may both decrease slightly below about 10-km depth. Magma body depth is
   near 18.75 km. A close fit between observed and modeled reflected phase
   arrival times and an even lateral distribution of positive and negative
   reflected-phase residuals indicate that the magma body upper surface is
   nearly flat.
   In the Socorro area, combining direct and reflected phases reduces
   average focal depth error by more than a factor of 3 and average origin
   time error by a factor of 2 compared with using only direct phases. This
   is because reflected arrivals are more sensitive to changes in focal
   depth than direct arrivals, and combining upgoing (direct) and downgoing
   (reflected) times reduces the trade-off between focal depth and origin
   time. For this method to be successful, phases must be carefully
   identified. To help identity secondary phases, we used relative arrival
   time curves, plotting phase-minus-P times versus S-minus-P times.
   Picking reflection pairs (SzP and SzS, SzP and PzP, or SzS and PzP
   identified on a single seismogram) significantly reduces the chances of
   phase misidentification. The SzP-SzS and SzP-PzP pairs also help prevent
   trade-offs between reflector depth and focal depths.}},

Abstract = {{Crustal structures for nine broad tectonic units in China, except the
   Tarim craton, are derived from seismic data for 18 geophysical
   refraction profiles, which include twelve geoscience transects and have
   a total length of 16216 km. AU the tectonic units except the Qinling
   orogen show a four-layered crustal structure, consisting of upper,
   middle, upper lower, and lowermost crust. If corrections are made to
   room temperature and 600 MPa, the upper lower crust has P-wave
   velocities of 6.7-6.8 km s(-1) and the lowermost crust 7.0-7.2 km s(-1).
   Velocities of the bulk lower crust and total crust are 6.8-7.0 and
   6.4-6.5 km s(-1), respectively. They are slower by 0.2-0.4 km s(-1),
   than the global averages. By correlation with experimental results on
   velocities of typical lower crustal rocks, the upper lower crust is
   suggested to be intermediate, while the lowermost crust is mafic in
   composition. Due to dominance of the former, the bulk lower crust is
   still intermediate for most tectonic units. However, inter-unit
   compositional variations are also evident, as indicated by large
   variations in the thickness ratio (0.3-3.0) of the upper lower to
   lowermost crust. The lower crust in East China as a whole is suggested
   to have similar to 57\% SiO2. The results contrast with generally
   accepted models of mafic lower crust. Our estimates of the total crust
   composition in central East China show a more evolved character compared
   to models of Rudnick and Fountain, and Taylor and McLennan and are
   characterized by a prominent negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu{*} = 0.80),
   higher SiO2 (61.8\%), and lower Sr/Nd (similar to 10) as well as lower
   Sr/Nd, Cr/Nd, Ni/Nd, Co/Nd, V/Nd and Ti/Nd ratios. This, together with
   slower crustal velocities and remarkably thin crustal thicknesses (34
   km) for the Paleozoic-Mesozoic Qinling-Dabie orogenic belt, leads to the
   suggestion that lower crustal delamination played an important role in
   modification of the East China crust. Mass balance modeling further
   suggests that eclogite from the Dabie-Sulu ultrahigh pressure
   metamorphic belt is the most likely candidate as the delaminated
   material, and that a cumulative 37-82 km thick eclogitic lower crust is
   required to have been delaminated in order to explain the relative Eu,
   Sr and transition metal deficits in the crust of central East China.
   Delamination of eclogites can also explain the significantly higher than
   eclogite Poisson's ratio in the present Dabie lower crust and upper
   mantle and lack of eclogite in Cenozoic xenolith populations of the
   lower crust and upper mantle in East China. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Purpose: Young trans women (YTW) carry a disproportionate burden of HIV.
   The developmental context of HIV risk for YTW is underexamined. The aim
   of this analysis was to examine whether parent/caregiver responses to
   gender identity were associated with engagement in HIV-related sexual
   risk behavior for YTW and whether these associations varied by
   racial/ethnic identity or age.
   Methods: Baseline data from the SHINE study (n = 300) at San Francisco
   Department of Public Health (2012-2014) were analyzed. Multivariable
   Poisson binomial regression models characterized relationships between
   parent/caregiver responses to gender identity and HIV-related sexual
   risk behaviors, adjusting for select participant demographics.
   Statistically significant interactions (by race/ethnicity or age) were
   plotted using marginal predicted probabilities of sexual risk behaviors.
   Results: Thirty-seven percent of YTW engaged in any condomless anal
   intercourse; 12\% reported income from sex work in the last month. Ever
   moving away from family and friends because of gender identity was
   associated with condomless anal intercourse (adjusted prevalence ratio
   {[}PR] = 1.44, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] =1.08-1.92, p =.01) and
   sex work (PR =2.07, 95\% CI = 1.14-3.75, p =.02). Ever receiving poor
   treatment from parents/caregivers because of gender identity was
   associated with sex work (PR = 3.47, 95\% CI = 1.52-7.95, p < .01).
   Greater parent/caregiver acceptance of gender identity was associated
   with lower adjusted prevalence of condomless anal intercourse for
   Hispanic/Latinx YTW.
   Conclusions: Negative parent/caregiver exposures related to YTW's gender
   identities were associated with increased HIV-related sexual risk
   behaviors, whereas parent/caregiver acceptance of gender identity was
   protective against condomless anal intercourse for Hispanic/Latinx YTW.
   There is a need for additional studies that inform interventions for YTW
   focusing on parent/caregiver relationships to prevent HIV-related risk
   behavior. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Society for Adolescent

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to identify the response of melon accessions and
   cultivars to salt stress in terms of ion exchange, enzyme activity,
   lipid peroxidation and photosynthetic pigment contents by mixture
   modelling. In mixture modeling, it is expected that the data set
   demonstrates a heterogeneous structure. This heterogeneity is
   characterized as unobservable heterogeneity. The data set's
   heterogeneity produces severe deviations in the parameter assessments
   and the standard deviations. Heterogeneity is overcome when the data set
   separates itself into homogeneous sub-populations. Mixture modeling was
   performed using the Mclust mixture cluster program of the statistical
   software package R 5.2.3. Sub-populations were constructed by evaluating
   genotypes according to studied traits and correlation analysis was
   performed using the SPSS software package. The seedlings of 13 melon
   genotypes were harvested two weeks after salt application (0 mM or 50 mM
   NaCl) when symptoms of salt stress were observed. Nutrient contents and
   ratios (K, Ca, Na, K : Na and Ca : Na); superoxide dismutase (SOD),
   catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities malondialdehyde
   (MDA) chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll and carotenoid
   contents were measured. Mixture modeling and correlation analysis were
   used in evaluating the experimental data sets. Differences in responses
   to salt application were observed among genotypes. While all genotypes
   exhibited negative responses in terms of K : Na ratio, which is an
   important parameter of salt tolerance, the smallest decreases in K : Na
   ratios were observed in the YYU-11 (-57.09\%) and YYU-4 (-58.78\%)
   genotypes, indicating them to be the most tolerant to salt stress. In
   general, enzyme activity decreased in response to salt application,
   although the responses varied among genotypes, especially with regard to
   CAT and APX activity. The YYU-29 genotype was notable as the genotype
   with the highest K : Na ratio (1.79) as well as the smallest change in

Title = {{Effectiveness of oral rotavirus vaccination in England against
   rotavirus-confirmed and all-cause acute gastroenteritis}},
Journal = {{VACCINE: X}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{1}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: The monovalent oral rotavirus vaccine Rotarix (R) was
   introduced into the UK infant immunisation programme in 2013. We
   estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the first two years of the
   programme.
   Methods: We used a test-negative case-control design and enhanced
   national surveillance data for 1869 vaccine-eligible children tested for
   rotavirus infection to obtain adjusted odds ratios and VE against
   laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections. Linked anonymised UK primary
   care and hospitalisation data from the Clinical Practice Research
   Datalink (40,723 children) and random-effects Poisson regression were
   used in a cohort study to estimate VE against all-cause acute
   gastroenteritis (AGE) and AGE hospitalisations.
   Results: VE against laboratory-confirmed infection was 69\% (95\%
   Confidence Interval: 40-84\%) for one dose and 77\% (95\%CI: 66-85\%)
   for two doses. Two-dose VE in children aged <12 months and >= 12 months
   was 85\% (95\%CI: 74-91\%) and 54\% (95\%CI: 15-75\%), respectively. In
   contrast, we found no evidence that the vaccine was effective against
   all-cause AGE (VE = -20\%, 95\%CI: -36\% to -5\%), or against AGE
   hospitalisations (VE = 35\%, 95\% CI: -86\% to 77\%).
   Conclusions: In this first detailed assessment of VE of the Rotarix (R)
   vaccine in the English national programme, we show that Rotarix (R) was
   highly effective in preventing laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infection
   in young children. This provides reassurance about the vaccine's
   performance in real-life settings and gives key information for future
   cost-effectiveness analyses. The high VE against rotavirus-specific AGE,
   and the exceptionally successful implementation of the national
   rotavirus vaccine programme (with >90\% vaccine coverage), explains the
   lack of VE against all-cause AGE because most AGE in the post-vaccine
   era would not have been due to rotavirus, although some underestimation
   of VE could also have occurred due to differential healthcare
   utilisation by vaccinated and unvaccinated infants. This highlights the
   importance of using specific vaccine-preventable endpoints for these
   scenarios. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Use of injectable progestin contraception and risk of STI among South
   African women}},
Journal = {{CONTRACEPTION}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study was conducted to determine the association between
   the use of injectable progestin contraception (IPC) and the risk of
   infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT),
   bacterial vaginosis (BV) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) among women in
   South Africa.
   Methods: From August 1999 through May 2001, 643 HTV-1-negative women
   were recruited from family planning clinics in Orange Farm, South
   Africa. IPC {[}norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN) and depot
   medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)] users and nonhormonal contraception
   users were recruited in approximately equal numbers. Eligible
   participants were seen at enrolment and on four follow-up visits over a
   12-month period; 567 returned for at least one follow-up visit.
   Multivariable Poisson regression models with generalized estimating
   equations were used to compute the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for
   infections with GC, CT, BV and TV by use of NET-EN or DMPA relative to
   nonuse during follow-up.
   Results: In multivariable models, the use of DMPA slightly increased the
   risk of infection with CT {[}IRR=1.24; 95\% confidence interval (95\%
   CI=0.80-1.94] and GC (IRR=1.30; 95\% CI=0.58-2.98), although these
   associations were not statistically significant. In contrast, DMPA
   appeared to be protective for TV (IRR=0.35; 95\% CI=0.12-1.01), although
   this estimate was very imprecise. The use of both DMPA and NET-EN was
   associated with a decreased risk of BV.
   Conclusions: The use of DMPA among women in this study population was
   associated with an increased - but not statistically significant risk of
   cervical infection with chlamydia and gonorrhea, and a decreased risk of
   TV and BV. Given the inconsistencies and limitations of the data
   describing an increased risk of CT and GC with IPC use, the potential
   risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) must be balanced against
   the risk of unintended pregnancy and its health consequences, especially
   in developing countries. Women opting to use IPC should be counseled to
   use condoms to protect against STIs and HIV. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Due to the significant luminescent properties of ZnS and the half
   metallic features of Cr doped ZnS (Zn0.75Cr0.25S), many researches have
   been done to make possible the use of these materials in optical and
   spintronic devices. The environmental conditions, such as, high pressure
   and high temperature, are crucial for the device service, however, it is
   difficult to exploit this issue from the experimental aspect. Therefore,
   spin-polarized first-principle calculations were performed to study the
   structural stability, band structure and magnetic properties of
   zincblende ZnS and Zn0.75Cr0.25S under pressure. It is shown that ZnS
   can exist stably under pressure up to 10 GPa, while Zn0.75Cr0.25S
   becomes unstable under a pressure of 5GPa or so. The bulk modulus (B-H),
   Poisson ratio (v) and anisotropic parameter (A) of ZnS and Zn0.75Cr0.25S
   increase with pressure, but the shear modulus (G(H)) decreases. B-H and
   G(H) of Zn0.75Cr0.25S are smaller than those of ZnS, while v and A of
   Zn0.75Cr0.25S are larger than those of ZnS. Both ZnS and Zn0.75Cr0.25S
   behave in a ductile manner, while Zn0.75Cr0.25S is more anisotropic and
   is easier to induce deformation than ZnS. As for ZnS, the direct band
   structure is kept but the band gap increases gradually with the
   pressure. As for Zn0.75Cr0.25S, the half metallic features are
   maintained up to a pressure of 10 GPa, but both the band gap for
   minority spin and the half metallic band gap have the largest values
   under 6 Pa. The spin exchange splitting energy Delta(x)(d) and
   Delta(x)(pd) decrease with the increase of pressure. The negative values
   of Delta(x)(pd) under pressure imply that the effective potential (E-ep)
   of the minority spin is more attractive than that of majority spin. (C)

Abstract = {{Driving status monitoring is highly desirable to ensure safety and
   prevent traffic accidents. Unsafe and inappropriate driving behaviors
   can be identified through the monitoring of the driver's body motion. A
   self-powered smart safety belt composed of two types of triboelectric
   nanogenerators (TENGs) is developed to monitor the forward position and
   turning actions of the driver. An auxetic Polyurethane (APU)-TENG
   integrated in the horizontal strip of the safety belt achieves high
   sensitivity (0.89V/cm(2)) for strain measurements in the large strain
   domain (40\%-100\%), enabling the long range monitoring of the forward
   position of the driver, which correlates to abrupt and aggressive
   deceleration. Two sensor arrays of arch-shaped TENGs (AS-TENGs) attached
   to shoulder and waist location of the diagonal strip in the safety belt
   can measure the turning directions and angles of the driver,
   respectively. The AS-TENGs are designed through the integration of two
   TENGs in the top and bottom arch, respectively, to ensure stable and
   gradually increased contact between the triboelectric layers in both
   arches, which leads to a high displacement measurement sensitivity of
   47.2 V/cm(3) with high linearity. This work demonstrates an effctive
   approach to integrate self-powered TENGs sensors seamlessly into
   existing driving environment for driving status monitoring, expanding
   the applictions of TENGs in wearable electronics.}},

Abstract = {{The population mixing hypothesis proposes that childhood leukaemia (CL)
   might be a rare complication of a yet unidentified subclinical
   infection. Large population influxes into previously isolated rural
   areas may foster localised epidemics of the postulated infection causing
   a subsequent increase of CL. While marked population growth after a
   period of stability was central to the formulation of the hypothesis and
   to the early studies on population mixing, there is a lack of objective
   criteria to define such growth patterns. We aimed to determine whether
   periods of marked population growth coincided with increases in the risk
   of CL in Swiss municipalities. We identified incident cases of CL aged
   0-15 years for the period 1985-2010 from the Swiss Childhood Cancer
   Registry. Annual data on population counts in Swiss municipalities were
   obtained for 1980-2010. As exposures, we defined (1) cumulative
   population growth during a 5-year moving time window centred on each
   year (1985-2010) and (2) periods of `take-off growth' identified by
   segmented linear regression. We compared CL incidence across exposure
   categories using Poisson regression and tested for effect modification
   by degree of urbanisation. Our study included 1500 incident cases and
   2561 municipalities. The incident rate ratio (IRR) comparing the highest
   to the lowest quintile of 5-year population growth was 1.18 (95 \% CI
   0.96, 1.46) in all municipalities and 1.33 (95 \% CI 0.93, 1.92) in
   rural municipalities (p value interaction 0.36). In municipalities with
   take-off growth, the IRR comparing the take-off period (> 6 \% annual
   population growth) with the initial period of low or negative growth (<
   2 \%) was 2.07 (95 \% CI 0.95, 4.51) overall and 2.99 (1.11, 8.05) in
   rural areas (p interaction 0.52). Our study provides further support for
   the population mixing hypothesis and underlines the need to distinguish
   take-off growth from other growth patterns in future research.}},

Title = {{A heteroskedastic error covariance matrix estimator using a first-order
   conditional autoregressive Markov simulation for deriving asympotical
   efficient estimates from ecological sampled Anopheles arabiensis aquatic
   habitat covariates}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autoregressive regression coefficients for Anopheles
   arabiensis aquatic habitat models are usually assessed using global
   error techniques and are reported as error covariance matrices. A global
   statistic, however, will summarize error estimates from multiple habitat
   locations. This makes it difficult to identify where there are clusters
   of An. arabiensis aquatic habitats of acceptable prediction. It is
   therefore useful to conduct some form of spatial error analysis to
   detect clusters of An. arabiensis aquatic habitats based on uncertainty
   residuals from individual sampled habitats. In this research, a method
   of error estimation for spatial simulation models was demonstrated using
   autocorrelation indices and eigenfunction spatial filters to distinguish
   among the effects of parameter uncertainty on a stochastic simulation of
   ecological sampled Anopheles aquatic habitat covariates. A test for
   diagnostic checking error residuals in an An. arabiensis aquatic habitat
   model may enable intervention efforts targeting productive habitats
   clusters, based on larval/pupal productivity, by using the asymptotic
   distribution of parameter estimates from a residual autocovariance
   matrix. The models considered in this research extends a normal
   regression analysis previously considered in the literature.
   Methods: Field and remote-sampled data were collected during July 2006
   to December 2007 in Karima rice-village complex in Mwea, Kenya. SAS
   9.1.4 (R) was used to explore univariate statistics, correlations,
   distributions, and to generate global autocorrelation statistics from
   the ecological sampled datasets. A local autocorrelation index was also
   generated using spatial covariance parameters (i.e., Moran's Indices) in
   a SAS/GIS (R) database. The Moran's statistic was decomposed into
   orthogonal and uncorrelated synthetic map pattern components using a
   Poisson model with a gamma-distributed mean (i.e. negative binomial
   regression). The eigenfunction values from the spatial configuration
   matrices were then used to define expectations for prior distributions
   using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. A set of posterior
   means were defined in WinBUGS 1.4.3 (R). After the model had converged,
   samples from the conditional distributions were used to summarize the
   posterior distribution of the parameters. Thereafter, a spatial residual
   trend analyses was used to evaluate variance uncertainty propagation in
   the model using an autocovariance error matrix.
   Results: By specifying coefficient estimates in a Bayesian framework,
   the covariate number of tillers was found to be a significant predictor,
   positively associated with An. arabiensis aquatic habitats. The spatial
   filter models accounted for approximately 19\% redundant locational

   data. In the residual error estimation model there was significant

Abstract = {{ObjectivesTo examine trends in tuberculosis (TB) incidence and to
   compare demographic and clinical characteristics of nursing home (NH)
   residents and community-dwelling older adults.
   DesignProspective TB surveillance.
   SettingTB cases reported in California from 2000 to 2009.
   ParticipantsTB patients aged 65 and older.
   MeasurementsTrends in TB incidence per 100,000 population were assessed
   using Poisson regression. Demographic and clinical characteristics were
   compared using the chi-square or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Among NH
   residents, risk factors for death during TB treatment were identified
   using logistic regression.
   ResultsFrom 2000 to 2009, TB incidence rates decreased significantly,
   from 15.9/100,000 to 8.4/100,000 (-44\%, 95\% confidence interval
   (CI)=-66\% to -7\%) for NH residents and from 21.2/100,000 to
   15.0/100,000 (-27\%, 95\% CI=-29\% to -24\%) for community-dwelling
   older adults. Overall, 211 TB cases among NH residents and 6,518 cases
   among community-dwelling older adults were reported. NH residents were
   more likely than community-dwelling older adults to be older (median age
   81 vs 75, P<.001), have a negative acid-fast bacilli sputum smear and
   positive culture (37\% vs 28\%, P<.001), and die while undergoing TB
   treatment (44\% vs 14\%, P<.001), and were less likely to have a
   positive tuberculin skin test (TST) (28\% vs 44\%, P<.001) and have TB
   care provided by a health department (20\% vs 59\%, P<.001). In
   multivariable analysis, NH residents who had a positive TST were less
   likely to die while undergoing TB treatment (odds ratio=0.39, 95\%
   CI=0.16-0.96).
   ConclusionTB incidence rates were lower, and reductions in incidence
   were greater among NH residents; community-dwelling older adults had
   higher TB rates and smaller reductions in incidence. Interventions that
   promote timely detection and treatment of TB infection and disease may
   be needed to reduce morbidity and mortality among NH residents.}},

Title = {{CAPACITY AND ERROR EXPONENTS OF STATIONARY POINT PROCESSES UNDER RANDOM

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Consider a real-valued discrete-time stationary and ergodic stochastic
   process, called the noise process. For each dimension n, we can choose a
   stationary point process in R-n and a translation invariant tessellation
   of R-n. Each point is randomly displaced, with a displacement vector
   being a section of length n of the noise process, independent from point
   to point. The aim is to find a point process and a tessellation that
   minimizes the probability of decoding error, defined as the probability
   that the displaced version of the typical point does not belong to the
   cell of this point. We consider the Shannon regime, in which the
   dimension n tends to infinity, while the logarithm of the intensity of
   the point processes, normalized by dimension, tends to a constant. We
   first show that this problem exhibits a sharp threshold: if the sum of
   the asymptotic normalized logarithmic intensity and of the differential
   entropy rate of the noise process is positive, then the probability of
   error tends to 1 with n for all point processes and all tessellations.
   If it is negative then there exist point processes and tessellations for
   which this probability tends to 0. The error exponent function, which
   denotes how quickly the probability of error goes to 0 in n, is then
   derived using large deviations theory. If the entropy spectrum of the
   noise satisfies a large deviations principle, then, below the threshold,
   the error probability goes exponentially fast to 0 with an exponent that
   is given in closed form in terms of the rate function of the noise
   entropy spectrum. This is obtained for two classes of point processes:
   the Poisson process and a Matern hard-core point process. New lower
   bounds on error exponents are derived from this for Shannon's additive
   noise channel in the high signal-to-noise ratio limit that hold for all
   stationary and ergodic noises with the above properties and that match
   the best known bounds in the white Gaussian noise case.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a density-based hierarchical group finding algorithm capable
   of identifying structures and substructures of any shape and density in
   multidimensional data sets where each dimension can be a numeric
   attribute with arbitrary measurement scale. This has applications in a
   wide variety of fields from finding structures in galaxy redshift
   surveys, to identifying halos and subhalos in N-body simulations and
   group finding in Local Group chemodynamical data sets. In general,
   clustering schemes require an a priori definition of a metric (a
   non-negative function that gives the distance between two points in a
   space) and the quality of clustering depends upon this choice. The
   general practice is to use a constant global metric which is optimal
   only if the clusters in the data are self-similar. For complex data
   configurations even the most finely tuned constant global metric turns
   out to be suboptimal. Moreover, the correct choice of metric also
   becomes increasingly important as the number of dimensions increase. To
   address these problems, we present an entropy-based binary space
   partitioning algorithm which uses a locally adaptive metric for each
   data point. The metric is employed to calculate the density at each
   point and a list of its nearest neighbors, and this information is then
   used to form a hierarchy of groups. Finally, the ratio of maximum to
   minimum density of points in a group is used to estimate the
   significance of the groups. Setting a threshold on this significance can
   effectively screen out groups arising due to Poisson noise and helps
   organize the groups into meaningful clusters. For a data set of N
   points, the algorithm requires only O(N) space and O(N(logN)(3)) time
   which makes it ideally suitable for analyzing large data sets. As an
   example, we apply the algorithm to identify structures in a simulated
   stellar halo using the full six-dimensional phase space coordinates.}},

Title = {{Pet-Keeping in Relation to Asthma, Rhinitis, and Eczema Symptoms Among
   Adolescents in Kuwait: A Cross-Sectional Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Background:Findings on the associations between household pet-keeping
   and allergic diseases, including asthma, rhinitis, and eczema, have been
   contradictory, with investigations reporting positive, negative, and
   null associations. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of
   pet-keeping among families in Kuwait and to assess the associations
   between pet-keeping and symptoms of allergic diseases among adolescents.
   Methods:Schoolchildren aged 11-14 years (n= 3,864) were enrolled in this
   cross-sectional study. The children's parents completed questionnaires
   regarding their child's environmental exposures, including pet-keeping
   in the past 12 months, and clinical history and symptoms of allergic
   diseases. Associations were assessed using Poisson regression with
   robust variance estimation, and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and
   their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated.
   Results:Pet-keeping in the past 12 months was reported by 42.8\% of the
   participating families. Birds, cats, rabbits, fish, and dogs were kept
   by 28.3, 13.2, 7.8, 3.9, and 3.1\% of all households, respectively.
   Current cat ownership was significantly associated with current wheezing
   (aPR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.05-1.58), current rhinitis symptoms (aPR 1.18, 95\%
   CI 1.02-1.36), and ever doctor-diagnosed eczema (aPR 1.25, 95\% CI
   1.03-1.50). Current rabbit-keeping was positively associated with
   multiple symptoms of asthma (e.g., study-defined current asthma: aPR
   1.38, 95\% CI 1.04-1.82) and eczema (e.g., severe eczema: aPR 1.94, 95\%
   CI 1.02-3.71). Similarly, current bird-keeping was associated with
   study-defined current rhinitis (aPR 1.19, 95\% CI 1.05-1.41) and current
   itchy rash (aPR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.10-1.46). Conclusions:Household
   pet-keeping is very common and diverse in Kuwait and was found to be
   positively associated with symptoms of allergic diseases among
   adolescents. The findings of associations between rabbit-keeping and
   symptoms of asthma and eczema add to the existing literature and further
   highlight the importance of considering the pet type when assessing such
   associations.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Inequalities in health information seeking behaviors (HISBs) using mass
   media and internet websites (web 1.0) are well documented. Little is
   known about web 2.0 such as social networking sites (SNS) and instant
   messaging (IM) and experiences of HISBs.
   Methods
   We surveyed representative Hong Kong Chinese adults (N = 10143, 54.9\%
   female; 72.3\% aged 25-64 years) on frequency of HISBs using traditional
   sources, internet websites, SNS (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), and IM (e.g.,
   WhatsApp, WeChat) and experiences measured using Information Seeking
   Experience Scale. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for HISBs and
   experiences by sociodemographic and health-related characteristics were
   yielded using multivariable Poisson regression with robust variance
   estimators. aPRs for experiences by HISBs using internet websites, SNS,
   and IM adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related characteristics
   were also yielded.
   Results
   Being female, higher educational attainment, not smoking, and being
   physically active were associated with HISBs using any source (all
   P<0.05). Older age had decreased aPRs for HISBs using traditional
   sources (P for trend = 0.03), internet websites (P for trend<0.001), and
   SNS (P for trend<0.001) but not for IM (aged 45-64 years: aPR = 1.48,
   95\% CI 1.07, 2.03). Lower educational attainment and income were
   associated with negative experiences including feelings of effort and
   difficulties in understanding the information (all P for trend<0.05).
   Older age had increased aPRs for difficulties in understanding the
   information (P for trend = 0.003). Compared with internet websites,
   HISBs using IM was associated with feelings of frustration (aPR = 1.39,
   95\% CI 1.08, 1.79), difficulties in understanding the information (aPR
   = 1.36, 95\% CI 1.12, 1.65), and quality concern (aPR = 1.20, 95\% CI
   1.08, 1.32).
   Conclusions
   We identified correlates of web-based health information seeking and
   experiences in Hong Kong Chinese adults. Providing greater access to and
   improved information environment of web 2.0 to the target groups may
   help address digital inequalities.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Clinical trials and spontaneous reporting systems have
   revealed rare but biologically plausible adverse events following
   varicella immunization. Few post-marketing controlled studies have been
   conducted to assess the relationship between the varicella vaccine and
   these outcomes.
   Objectives: To evaluate the risk of pneumonia, idiopathic
   thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), meningitis, encephalitis and ischemic
   stroke following varicella immunization.
   Materials and methods: This nationwide observational study was based on
   Taiwan National Health Insurance data and National Immunization
   Information System from 2004 through 2014. Primary analysis included
   children aged 12-35 months who received the single varicella vaccine on
   the date of administration. The self-controlled risk interval design
   compared the incidence of pre-specified outcomes during a risk interval
   of 1-42 days post-vaccination and a control interval of 43-84 days. The
   outcomes of interest were defined as admitted pneumonia, ITP,
   meningitis, encephalitis, and ischemic stroke, as well as fracture as a
   negative control. Conditional Poisson regression was used to assess the
   incidence rate ratio (aIRR) with adjustments for age and seasonal
   effects.
   Results: Among 1,194,189 children, who receiving the varicella vaccine,
   there was no observed increase in the risk for ITP (aIRR 1.00; 95\% CI,
   0.76-1.33), meningitis (aIRR 1.21; 95\% CI, 0.49-2.95), encephalitis
   (aIRR 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.62-1.60), or ischemic stroke (aIRR 1.24; 95\% CI,
   0.31-4.95). A clustering feature with pneumonia occurred during days
   36-42 post-vaccination (aIRR 1.10; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.18). An increase in
   the risk for ITP was observed in children receiving the varicella and
   MMR vaccines concomitantly (aIRR 1.70; 95\% CI, 1.19-2.43), but not
   among those receiving the varicella vaccine only.
   Conclusions: We detected a small risk of incidental pneumonia associated
   with varicella vaccine in the 6th week after immunization. There was no
   increase in the risk of other pre-specified adverse events. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Purpose: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has become a public health challenge
   in low-income countries due to changing lifestyle and the food
   environment. However, studies on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome
   and associated factors are limited in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study
   assessed the prevalence of MetS and its associated factors among working
   adults in eastern Ethiopia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 1,164 working
   adults from December 2018 to February 2019. Data were collected
   following the World Health Organization (WHO) STEPwise approach. The
   data collection tools include a structured questionnaire,
   anthropometric, and biochemical measurements. Prevalence was calculated
   using International Diabetes Federation criteria. A Poisson regression
   model with robust variance estimation was used to investigate the
   independent variable's association with MetS. An adjusted prevalence
   ratio with 95\% confidence interval was reported to show associations.
   Results: The prevalence of MetS was 20.1\% (95\% CI=17.8-22.4) among the
   participants. It was more prevalent among females (APR:=1.62, 95\%
   CI=1.31-2.00), those of 35-44 years of age (APR:=3.14, 95\%
   CI=1.19-8.28), 45-54 years of age (APR=4.42, 95\% CI=1.66-11.77), and
   55-64 years of age (APR=6.03, 95\% CI=2.27-16.06), khat chewers
   (APR=1.30, 95\% CI=1.06-1.60), those with 8 or more hours of sedentary
   behavior (APR=2.29, 95\% CI=1.88-2.80), and those consuming alcohol 5-6
   days per week (APR=1.81, 95\% CI=1.20-2.74). The prevalence was
   significantly lower in those eating five or more fruits and vegetables
   servings per day (APR=0.04, 95\% CI=0.01-0.27).
   Conclusion: A high prevalence of MetS was observed among working adults
   in eastern Ethiopia. Strengthening workplace health promotion programs
   is necessary to reduce the negative consequences of MetS in workplaces
   and protect productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite a clear association seen in congenitally infected
   children, the effect of postnatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection during
   early childhood on cognitive development has not yet been determined.
   Methods: CMV-infection status was obtained based on serological
   measurements when children were 7 years old. Using population-based
   longitudinal data, we employed multivariate Poisson regression with a
   robust variance estimator to characterize the relationship between
   childhood CMV infection and adverse neurocognitive outcomes in children.
   Suboptimal neurocognitive outcomes were compared between CMV-positive
   and CMV-negative children using various cognitive assessments from 8 to
   15 years of age. Children were evaluated on the cognitive domains of
   language, reading, memory and general intelligence, with a suboptimal
   score being >2 standard deviations lower than the mean score.
   Approximate Bayes factor (ABF) analysis was used to determine the level
   of evidence for the observed associations.
   Results: With adjustment for potential confounders, we observed that
   early-childhood CMV infection was associated with suboptimal total
   intelligence quotient (IQ) at 8 years of age {[}incidence-rate ratio
   (IRR) = 2.50, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-4.62, ABF =0.08], but
   not with suboptimal total IQ at 15 years of age (IRR =0.97, 95\% CI
   0.43-2.19, ABF = 1.68). Suboptimal attentional control at 8 years (IRR =
   1.74, 95\% CI 1.13-2.68, ABF = 0.18) and reading comprehension at 9
   years (IRR =1.93, 95\% CI 1.12-3.33, ABF = 0.24) were also associated
   with CMV infection. ABF analysis provided strong evidence for the
   association between CMV infection and total IQ at 8 years, and only
   anecdotal evidence for attentional control at 8 years and reading
   comprehension at 9 years. All other cognitive measures assessed were not
   associated with CMV infection.
   Conclusion: In this large-scale prospective cohort, we observed some
   evidence for adverse neurocognitive effects of postnatal CMV infection
   on general intelligence during early childhood, although not with
   lasting effect. If confirmed, these results could support the
   implementation of preventative measures to combat postnatal CMV
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The associations between anemia and household water source
   and sanitation remain unclear.
   Objectives: We aimed to assess the associations between anemia and
   household water source or sanitation in preschool children (PSC; age
   6-59 mo) using population-based surveys from the Biomarkers Reflecting
   Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project.
   Methods: We analyzed national and subnational data from 21 surveys,
   representing 19 countries (n = 35,963). Observations with hemoglobin
   (Hb) and >= 1 variable reflecting household water source or sanitation
   were included. Anemia was defined as an altitude-adjusted Hb
   concentration <110 g/L. Household water source and sanitation variables
   were dichotomized as ``improved{''} or ``unimproved.{''} Poisson
   regressions with robust variance estimates were conducted for each
   survey, adjusting for child sex, age, household socioeconomic status,
   maternal education, and type of residence.
   Results: Access to an improved water source and improved sanitation
   ranged from 29.9\% (Burkina Faso) to 98.4\% (Bangladesh, 2012), and from
   0.2\% (Kenya, 2007) to 97.4\% (Philippines), respectively. Prevalence of
   anemia ranged from 20.1\% (Nicaragua) to 83.5\% (Bangladesh, 2010).
   Seven surveys showed negative associations between anemia and improved
   sanitation. Three surveys showed association between anemia and improved
   water, with mixed directions. Meta-analyses suggested a protective
   association between improved household sanitation and anemia {[}adjusted
   prevalence ratio (aPR) = 0.88; 95\% CI: 0.79, 0.98], and no association
   between improved household water and anemia (aPR = 1.00; 95\% CI: 0.91,
   1.10). There was heterogeneity across surveys for sanitation (P < 0.01;
   I-2 = 66.3\%) and water (P < 0.01; I-2 = 55.8\%).
   Conclusions: Although improved household sanitation was associated with
   reduced anemia prevalence in PSC in some surveys, this association was
   not consistent. Access to an improved water source in general had no
   association with anemia across surveys. Additional research could help
   clarify the heterogeneity between these conditions across countries to
   inform anemia reduction programs.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after liver
   transplantation (LT) has been limited by the lack of a multicenter study
   with detailed clinical information. An integrated database linking
   information from the University HealthSystem Consortium and the Organ
   Procurement and Transplant Network was analyzed using multivariate
   Poisson regression to assess factors associated with 30- and 90-day MACE
   after LT (February 2002 to December 2012). MACE was defined as
   myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation
   (AF), cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, and/or stroke. Of 32 810
   recipients, MACE hospitalizations occurred in 8\% and 11\% of patients
   at 30 and 90 days, respectively. Recipients with MACE were older and
   more likely to have a history of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
   alcoholic cirrhosis, MI, HF, stroke, AF and pulmonary and chronic renal
   disease than those without MACE. In multivariable analysis, age >65
   years (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] 2.8, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}95\% CI] 1.8-4.4), alcoholic cirrhosis (IRR 1.6, 95\% CI 1.2-2.2),
   NASH (IRR 1.6, 95\% CI 1.1-2.4), pre-LT creatinine (IRR 1.1, 95\% CI
   1.04-1.2), baseline AF (IRR 6.9, 95\% CI 5.0-9.6) and stroke (IRR 6.3,
   95\% CI 1.6-25.4) were independently associated with MACE. MACE was
   associated with lower 1-year survival after LT (79\% vs. 88\%, p <
   0.0001). In a national database, MACE occurred in 11\% of LT recipients
   and had a negative impact on survival. Pre-LT AF and stroke
   substantially increase the risk of MACE, highlighting potentially
   high-risk LT candidates.
   Using an integrated database that links information from the University
   HealthSystem Consortium and the OPTN, the authors assess factors
   associated with 30- and 90-day major adverse cardiac events after liver
   transplantation and discover that cardiac events occur in 11\% of liver
   transplant recipients, and that a history of atrial fibrillation and
   stroke are significant predictors of these events.}},

   Implications for Pay for Performance}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Interhospital transfer is frequent, and transferred patients
   can have worse outcomes than direct admissions. We sought to define the
   incidence of interhospital transfer in general surgery and evaluate its
   association with surgical outcomes.
   STUDY DESIGN: The 2011 American College of Surgeons NSQIP database was
   used. Transferred patients were compared with urgent, inpatient direct
   admissions in a series of increasingly complex risk- adjustment models,
   including multiple regression using modified Poisson and negative
   binomial models, as well as propensity scores. Primary outcomes were
   overall complications, mortality, length of stay, and readmission.
   RESULTS: Overall, 7\% of inpatient general surgery cases were
   transferred in. Among urgent cases, there were 6,197 transferred
   patients and 47,267 direct admissions. The most common procedures for
   direct admissions were appendectomy and cholecystectomy, and transfers
   had a more complex and broader range of procedures. On unadjusted
   analysis, transferred patients had a much higher risk for complications
   (risk ratio {[}RR] 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.45-1.52) and mortality (RR = 2.70;
   95\% CI, 2.48-2.94), as well as a longer length of stay (1.74 times
   longer; 95\% CI, 1.69-1.78) and higher risk of readmission (RR = 1.31;
   95\% CI, 1.20-1.44). In the most sophisticated model, the propensity
   score match, the difference in outcomes for transferred patients was
   only modestly higher or equivalent (complications: RR = 1.03; 95\% CI,
   1.00-1.07; mortality: RR = 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.88-1.09; length of stay:
   1.08 times longer; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.11; readmission: RR = 0.97; 95\% CI,
   0.88-1.08).
   CONCLUSIONS: Interhospital transfer is frequent in surgery. Worse
   outcomes seen in transferred patients are largely due to confounding by
   patient characteristics rather than any true harm from transfer. Pay-
   for- performance schemes should adjust for transfer status to avoid
   unfairly penalizing hospitals that frequently accept transfers. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{As the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves increases,
   emergency health serviceutilization, including ambulance service, has
   correspondingly increased across the world. The negative effects of air
   pollution on health complicate these adverse health effects. This
   research work is the first known study to analyze the joint effects of
   heatwaves and air quality on the ambulance service in Western Australia
   (WA). The main objective is to investigate the potential joint effects
   of heatwaves and air quality on the ambulance service for vulnerable
   populations in the Perth metropolitan area. A time series design was
   used. Daily data on ambulance callouts, temperature and air pollutants
   (CO, SO2, NO2, O-3, PM10 and PM2.5) were collected for the Perth
   metropolitan area, WA from 2006 to 2015. Poisson regression modeling was
   used to assess the association between heatwaves, air quality, and
   ambulance callouts. Risk assessments on age, gender, socio-economic
   status (SES), and joint effects between heatwaves and air quality on
   ambulance callouts were conducted. The ambulance callout rate was higher
   during heatwave days (14.20/100,000/day) compared to non-heatwave days
   (13.95/100,000/day) with a rate ratio of 1.017 (95\% confidence interval
   1.012, 1.023). The ambulance callout rate was higher in males, people
   over 60 years old, people with low SES, and those living in coastal
   areas during period of heatwaves. Exposure to CO, SO2, O-3 and P-2.5
   increased risk on ambulance callouts and exposure to NO2 showed joint
   effect with heatwave and increased risk of ambulance callouts by 3\%
   after adjustment of all other risk factors. Ambulance callouts are an
   important indicator for evaluating heatwave-related emergency morbidity
   in WA. As the median concentrations of air pollutants in WA were lower
   than the Australian National Standards, the interactive effects of
   heatwaves and air quality on ambulance service need to be further
   examined, especially when air pollutants exceed the standards. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Background: Depression in the elderly population has been identified as
   a significant public health problem associated with adverse outcomes
   such as decreased quality of life, cognitive decline, and increased
   rates of suicide. We aimed to determine the prevalence and factors
   associated with depressive symptoms among geriatric population in Moshi
   district council, northern Tanzania. Methods: This community-based
   cross-sectional study was conducted in Moshi rural district, northern
   Tanzania, between June and July 2019. A multi-stage sampling technique
   was used to recruit 304 elders aged 60 or more years. We used geriatric
   depression scale (GDS-15) to assess depression. Generalized linear model
   with Poisson family and log link function was used to estimate
   prevalence ratio (PR) and the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals
   for factors associated with geriatric depressive symptoms. Results: A
   total of 304 participants were enrolled, the median age (interquartile
   range) 67 (62-75.5 years), and about half (51\%) were females. The
   prevalence of geriatric depressive symptoms was 44.4\%. Elders with a
   self-reported history of cognitive impairment had higher prevalence of
   depressive symptoms (PR = 1.66, 95\%CI 1.16, 2.38) while elders with
   intermediate (PR = 0.56, 95\%CI 0.38, 0.82) and strong social support
   (PR = 0.27, 95\%CI 0.17, 0.44) were less likely to have depressive
   symptoms compared to those with no available social support.
   Conclusions: Nearly one in every two elders had geriatric depressive
   symptoms. Depressive symptoms were associated with self-reported history
   of cognitive impairment and availability of social support. We recommend
   community screening, awareness creation, and social support
   interventions for early identification and management of depressive
   symptoms in this population.}},

Abstract = {{A passive solid cannot do work on its surroundings through any
   quasistatic cycle of deformations. This property places strong
   constraints on the allowed elastic moduli. In this Article, we show that
   static elastic moduli altogether absent in passive elasticity can arise
   from active, non-conservative microscopic interactions. These active
   moduli enter the antisymmetric (or odd) part of the static elastic
   modulus tensor and quantify the amount of work extracted along
   quasistatic strain cycles. In two-dimensional isotropic media, two
   chiral odd-elastic moduli emerge in addition to the bulk and shear
   moduli. We discuss microscopic realizations that include networks of
   Hookean springs augmented with active transverse forces and
   non-reciprocal active hinges. Using coarse-grained microscopic models,
   numerical simulations and continuum equations, we uncover phenomena
   ranging from auxetic behaviour induced by odd moduli to elastic wave
   propagation in overdamped media enabled by self-sustained active strain
   cycles. Our work sheds light on the non-Hermitian mechanics of two- and
   three-dimensional active solids that conserve linear momentum but
   exhibit a non-reciprocal linear response.
   Active, non-conservative interactions can give rise to elastic moduli
   that are forbidden in equilibrium and enter the antisymmetric part of
   the stiffness tensor. The resulting solids function as distributed
   elastic engines that can perform work on their surroundings through
   quasistatic strain cycles.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Cellular materials such as foams, honeycombs, or auxetic structures are
   an interesting type of structural materials for lightweight
   constructions or dynamic energy absorbers. These microheterogeneous
   materials consist of a hierarchical structure. Foams can be separated
   into a macro scale, meso scale, and micro scale dealing with the entire
   specimen or component, individual pores, and individual struts,
   respectively. As a result, the macroscopic foam properties are strongly
   related to the mesoscopic and microscopic properties as a superposition
   of geometrical structural response and material properties. Whereas the
   geometry can be easily determined, e.g., by computer tomography
   measurements, the evaluation of real micro material properties of
   individual struts or cell walls is still a very challenging task. The
   material properties of these constituents of open-cell or closed-cell
   foams significantly differ from bulk material properties due to changes
   in boundary condition during production and different scaling effects,
   such as different surface-to-volume ratios of oxide layers or different
   cooling conditions due to less material in struts than in the bulk.
   However, the need for reliable micro material properties for the
   realistic forecast of macroscopic properties of components made of foam
   by numerical simulations makes the micromechanical characterization and
   testing of metal foams to an emerging field of research. The present
   contribution deals with the most relevant achievements in the field from
   the beginnings to the present day.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from shock tube experiments on the
   transmitted overpressure through multiple layers of ballistic fabrics
   backed by various foam based flexible blunt trauma pads. The results
   corroborate previous reports that multiple layers of ballistic
   protection fabrics alone are not effective in reducing the occurrence of
   shock/blast wave injury. On the contrary, multiple layers of fabric and
   flexible laminates (Twaron T717, Twaron UD41 and Spectra Shield SA-1211)
   amplified the transmitted shock wave pressure. Moreover, this
   amplification in the transmitted peak pressure increased further when
   more plies were added. Incorporating foam based flexible blunt trauma
   pads behind the Twaron fabric resulted in mixed outcomes on the
   transmitted shock wave depending on the makeup of the blunt trauma pads.
   Adding pads comprising open cell polyurethane foams resulted in further
   and significant amplification of the recorded peak pressure. Attempts
   were made to reduce the pressure amplification by infusing the foams
   with shear thickening fluid. Although successful in reducing the peak
   pressure compared to a system of fabric backed by neat foam padding, the
   transmitted peak pressure was still slightly higher or at best equal to
   a system of fabrics without any padding. It was also found that padding
   made of auxetic foams fared better than conventional foams as they did
   not give rise to the large amplification in peak pressures.}},

   appraisal of the trends to understand the dynamics of evolution of this
   technology in different sub-fields. In light of the aforesaid, this
   paper chronicles the recent progress and presents a snapshot of reported
   resources and processing considerations enabling the accelerated
   adoption of fused deposition modelling (FDM) for polymeric smart
   structures. Sections of the review capture reported processing
   conditions and properties of components fabricated with FDM using either
   piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) polymer along with its
   composites or shape memory polymers/ composites. The review highlights
   applications that range from simple planar structures, lattice/auxetic
   structures, energetic composites, adaptive/shape-morphing metamaterials,
   to thermo-/optical-/hydro-sensitive components. It is surmised that
   while the adoption of FDM in this area has been rapid, more concerted
   efforts are needed concerning the synthesis of smart polymer feedstocks,
   process simulation for defect minimization, tuning of the FDM process,
   and standardization of tests for characterizations of fabricated
   samples.}},

Abstract = {{It has been few years since the preliminary translational research study
   on mechanics performance of autologous pulmonary tissue were published
   to circumvent complication relies to SVD. Several studies reported the
   modification of pulmonary native autograft root subjected to dynamic
   stress strain in long-term outcomes of aortic valve replacement. Our
   multidisciplinary research team firstly describe the weave relationship
   between stress-strain, growth and remodelling in an experimental model
   of Ross Operation. From a biomechanical point of view, the rapid
   absorption of polydioxanone constituting the internal part of the device
   may limit the potential negative effect of excessive stretching and
   improvement of steeper curve in the circumferential response.
   Improvement of longitudinal stretching of pulmonary autograft by
   external component of device are indicative of auxetic effect of e-PTFE.
   Successful reinforcement with semiresorbable device can also be
   favourable to pulmonary autograft function in growing patients needing
   to match somatic growth. The attendant decrease in PA expansion and the
   preserved features of the valve leaflets enhances durability of Ross
   operation. Strengthening of the distal pulmonary root anastomosis using
   external reinforcement, modifying the ascending phase of the
   circumferential stress curve, might be advisable as previously
   described. PA is an ideal substitute for aortic valve replacement not
   only in Mr. Ross's dreams but also from the biomechanical point of view.}},

Title = {{Migration and risk of HIV acquisition in Rakai, Uganda: a
   population-based cohort study}},
Journal = {{LANCET HIV}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Background In sub-Saharan Africa, migrants typically have higher HIV
   prevalence than non-migrants; however, whether HIV acquisition typically
   precedes or follows migration is unknown. We aimed to investigate the
   risk of HIV after migration in Rakai District, Uganda.
   Methods In a prospective population-based cohort of HIV-negative
   participants aged 15-49 years in Rakai, Uganda, between April 6, 1999,
   and Jan 30, 2015, we assessed the association between migration and HIV
   acquisition. Individuals were classified as recent in-migrants (<= 2
   years in community), non-recent in-migrants (>2 years in community), or
   permanent residents with no migration history. The primary outcome was
   incident HIV infection. We used Poisson regression to estimate incidence
   rate ratios (IRRs) of HIV associated with residence status with
   adjustment for demographics, sexual behaviours, and time. Data were also
   stratified and analysed within three periods (1999-2004, 2005-11, and
   2011-15) in relation to the introduction of combination HIV prevention
   (CHP; pre-CHP, early CHP, and late CHP).
   Findings Among 26 995 HIV-negative people who participated in the Rakai
   Community Cohort Study survey, 15 187 (56\%) contributed one or more
   follow-up visits (89 292 person-years of follow-up) and were included in
   our final analysis. 4451 (29\%) were ever in-migrants and 10 736 (71\%)
   were permanent residents. 841 incident HIV events occurred, including
   243 (29\%) among in-migrants. HIV incidence per 100 person-years was
   significantly increased among recent in-migrants compared with permanent
   residents, for both women (1.92, 95\% CI 1.52-2.43 vs 0.93, 0.84-1.04;
   IRR adjusted for demographics 1.75, 95\% CI 1.33-2.33) and men (1.52,
   0.99-2.33 vs 0.84, 0.74-0.94; 1.74, 1.12-2.71), but not among non-recent
   in-migrants (IRR adjusted for demographics 0.94, 95\% CI 0.74-1.19 for
   women and 1.28, 0.94-1.74 for men). Between the pre-CHP and late-CHP
   periods, HIV incidence declined among permanent resident men (p<0.0001)
   and women (p=0.002) and non-recent in-migrant men (p=0.031), but was
   unchanged among non-recent in-migrant women (p=0.13) and recent
   in-migrants (men p=0.76; women p=0.84)
   Interpretation The first 2 years after migration are associated with
   increased risk of HIV acquisition. Prevention programmes focused on
   migrants are needed to reduce HIV incidence in sub-Saharan Africa.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a fast procedure to predict solvation free energies
   for both organic and biological molecules. This solvation model is based
   on weighted solvent accessible surface area (WSAS). Least-squares
   fittings have been applied to optimize the weights of SAS for different
   atom types in order to reproduce the experimental solvation free
   energies. Good agreement with experimental results has been obtained.
   For the 184-molecule set (model I), for which there are experimental
   solvation free energies in 1-octanol, we have achieved an average error
   of 0.36 kcal/mol, better than that of the SM5.42R universal solvation
   model(1) by Li et al. For the 245-molecule set (model II) that has
   experimental aqueous solvation free energies, our WSAS model achieves an
   average error of 0.48 kcal/mol, marginally larger than that of Li's
   model (0.46 kcal/mol). We have used a 401 molecule set, the largest
   training set (model IV) that we know of solvation model development, to
   derive the SAS weights in order to reproduce the experimental solvation
   free energies in water. For this model, we have achieved an average
   unsigned error of 0.54 kcal/mol and an RMS error of 0.79 kcal/mol. The
   advantage of this model lies in its simplicity and independence of
   charge models. We have successfully applied this model to predict the
   relative binding free energies for the five binding modes of
   HIV-1RT/efavirenz. The most favorable binding mode, which has an RMSD of
   1.1 Angstrom (for 54 C-alpha around the binding site) compared to the
   crystal structure, has a binding free energy at least 10 kcal/mol more
   negative than the other binding modes. Moreover, the solvation free
   energies with WSAS have a high correlation (the correlation coefficient
   is 0.92) to the solvation free energies calculated by the
   Poisson-Boltzmann/surface area (PBSA) model. As an efficient and fast
   approach, WASA is also attractive for protein modeling and protein
   folding studies. We have applied this model to predict the solvation
   free energies of the 36-mer villin headpiece subdomain in its native
   structure, a compact folding intermediate, and a random coil. The rank
   order of the solvation free energies and the free energies for the three
   kinds of conformational clusters are in reasonable agreement with those
   found by MM-PBSA, a widely used solvation free energy model.}},

Title = {{CHARACTERIZING LINEAR BIRTH AND DEATH PROCESSES}},

Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{420}},
Pages = {{1183-1187}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This research determined the manner of convergence of certain Markov
   processes to their steady state limiting distributions. This article
   looks at linear birth and death processes with birth rate at each state
   determined by the immigration constant a and the natural growth
   multiplier b; with death rate at each state determined by fixed
   execution constant c and the natural declination multiplier d. All
   parameters are nonnegative. There is a reflective barrier at state 0. It
   is shown that when the natural growth multiplier is less than the
   declination parameter a limiting distribution exists, that is, when the
   multiplier difference is negative. We define a modal indicator as the
   ratio of the sum of the death parameters c and d diminished by
   immigration a to the multiplier difference. It is shown that when the
   modal indicator is negative then the mode occurs at state 0. When the
   indicator is an integer then the process is bimodal with the mode at
   that integral value and at the next larger integer. When the indicator
   is not an integer then the mode occurs at the first integral value
   greater than the modal indicator. Additionally, bounds for the birth
   probabilities and the tail probabilities are derived. These equations
   are applied to an example in the area of computer performance analysis.
   The objective of studying the characteristics of the limiting
   distribution is to understand the difficulties involved when simulating
   these processes. The most extensively studied of these types of Markov
   processes is the M/M/1 process (Poisson arrivals to one server having
   exponential service times). This is a simple case of a linear birth and
   death process where b = d = 0. Researchers have suggested speeding
   convergence by initializing the process in a state other than 0. This
   article reveals that zero is a good choice for the M/M/1 process, but it
   is not the best choice for the general linear birth and death process.
   Also, practitioners have devised empirical methods to decide when the
   number of iterations N is sufficient to declare convergence. This
   article presents bounds on the tail probabilities in order to guide the
   selection of N at the onset of simulation. The sense of the theorems
   proved below can be captured by these statements: 1. The natural growth
   multiplier b must be less than the declination parameter d to insure
   convergence. 2. If the modal indicator is relatively large then
   intitializing the process in the modal state might be wise. 3. Large
   values of the declination parameter d relative to the growth multiplier
   b will result in a better behaved process.}},

Abstract = {{Protein structure is an important field of research, with particular
   significance in its potential applications in biomedicine and
   nanotechnology. In a recent study, we presented a general approach for
   comparing protein structures and origami models and demonstrated it with
   single-domain proteins. For example, the analysis of the a-helical
   barrel of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) suggests that there are
   similar patterns between its structure and the Kresling origami model,
   providing insight into structure-activity relationships. Here we
   demonstrate that our approach can be expanded beyond single-domain
   proteins to also include multi-domain proteins, and to study dynamic
   processes of biomolecules. Two examples are given: (1) The eukaryotic
   chaperonin (TRiC) protein is compared with a newly generated origami
   model, and with an origami model that is constructed from two copies of
   the Flasher origami model, and (2) the CorA Magnesium transport system
   is compared with a newly generated origami model and with an origami
   model that combines the Kresling and Flasher origami models. Based on
   the analysis of the analog origami models, it is indicated that it is
   possible to identify building blocks for constructing assembled origami
   models that are analogous to protein structures. In addition, it is
   identified that the expansion/collapse mechanisms of the TRiC and CorA
   are auxetic. Namely, these proteins require a single motion for
   synchronized folding along two or three axes.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The objective of this study was to examine central venous
   catheter (CVC)-related nosocomial blood stream infection risks of
   umbilical venous, percutaneous and Broviac catheters, as well as
   variations in CVC use and CVC-related risk for nosocomial blood stream
   infection in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
   Methods. A cohort study was performed based on 19 507 infants admitted
   to 17 NICUs in the Canadian Neonatal Network from January, 1996, through
   October, 1997. Information on these subjects was prospectively collected
   by trained abstractors. Incidence of infection was measured as infection
   episodes per 1000 patient days. The risk ratio (RR) of CVC use for
   nosocomial blood stream infection was calculated as the infection rate
   during catheter days divided by the infection rate during noncatheter
   days. Using a Poisson regression model we examined the adjusted RR of
   CVC use for nosocomial blood stream infection, controlling for patient
   characteristics and illness severity at admission. Interinstitutional
   variations in CVC-related infection risks were examined by stratified
   analyses.
   Results. CVC were used in 22.5\% of patients. The incidence of
   nosocomial blood stream infection was 2.9 per 1000 noncatheter days, 7.2
   per 1000 umbilical venous catheter days, 13.1 per 1000 percutaneous
   catheter days and 12.1 per 1000 Broviac catheter days. The RR for
   nosocomial blood stream infection, adjusted for differences in patient
   characteristics and admission illness severity, was 2.5 for umbilical
   venous catheter, 4.6 for percutaneous catheter and 4.3 for Broviac
   catheter (P < 0.05). There were significant (P < 0.05) risk-adjusted
   variations in CVC-related infection risks among NICUs.
   Conclusions. CVC use increased the risk of nosocomial blood stream
   infection. The risk of nosocomial blood stream infection in percutaneous
   and Broviac catheters was 70 to 80\% higher than in umbilical venous
   catheters. There was significant variation in CVC-related infection
   risks among Canadian NICUs.}},

Title = {{Design and analysis of 2D/3D negative hydration expansion Metamaterial
   driven by hydrogel}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{196}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we developed a new design and preparation method of 2D
   and 3D composite metamaterial with adjustable isotropic negative
   hydration expansion (NHE) function based on re-entrant auxetic
   honeycomb. The metamaterial is composed of composite lattice
   microstructure with hydrogel driving layer and re-entrant framework and
   prepared by multi-material 3D printer. Experimental, simulation and
   theoretical investigation were carried out to demonstrate the design
   method and NHE deformation effects of the metamaterial. It was shown
   that the effective NHE coefficient depends on the length of the driving
   layer and the straight bar connecting the lattice microstructures. In
   addition, a non-monotonic relationship was found between the bandings
   angle theta 2 and the length ratio (s/a) due to the constraint effect on
   both ends of the composite beam. Through the parameter design of the
   lattice microstructure, the NHE coefficient of can be adjusted within
   the range of 0-22.4\%. For the 3D sample, the value of the NHE
   coefficient is among the largest achieved in experiments to date. This
   work provides a practical method for obtaining 2D and 3D metamaterial
   with adjustable NHE and can be applied to the design of macro-, microand
   nano-metamaterial. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This

Abstract = {{Straight beams, rods and trusses are common elements in structural and
   mechanical engineering, but recent advances in additive manufacturing
   now also enable efficient freeform fabrication of curved, deformable
   beams and beam structures, such as microstructures, metamaterials and
   conformal lattices. To exploit this new design freedom for applications
   with nonlinear mechanical behavior, we introduce an isogeometric method
   for shape optimization of curved 3D beams and beam structures. The
   geometrically exact Cosserat rod theory is used to model nonlinear 3D
   beams subject to large deformations and rotations. The initial and
   current geometry are parameterized in terms of NURBS curves describing
   the beam centerline and an isogeometric collocation approach is used to
   discretize the strong form of the balance equations. Then, a nonlinear
   optimization problem is formulated in order to optimize the positions of
   the control points of the NURBS curve that describes the beam
   centerline, i.e., the geometry or shape of the beam. To solve the design
   problem using gradient-based algorithms, we introduce semi-analytical,
   inconsistent analytical and fully analytical approaches for calculation
   of design sensitivities. The methods are numerically validated and their
   performance is investigated, before the applicability and versatility of
   our 3D beam shape optimization method is illustrated in various
   numerical applications, including optimization of an auxetic 3D
   metamaterial. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Association of Opioid Agonist Therapy With Lower Incidence of Hepatitis
   C Virus Infection in Young Adult Injection Drug Users}},
Journal = {{JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Injection drug use is the primary mode of transmission for
   hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Prior studies suggest opioid agonist
   therapymay reduce the incidence of HCV infection among injection drug
   users; however, little is known about the effects of this therapy in
   younger users.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether opioid agonist therapy was associated with
   a lower incidence of HCV infection in a cohort of young adult injection
   drug users.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observational cohort study conducted
   from January 3, 2000, through August 21, 2013, with quarterly interviews
   and blood sampling. We recruited young adult (younger than 30 years)
   injection drug users who were negative for anti-HCV antibody and/or HCV
   RNA.
   EXPOSURES Substance use treatment within the past 3 months, including
   non-opioid agonist forms of treatment, opioid agonist (methadone
   hydrochloride or buprenorphine hydrochloride) detoxification or
   maintenance therapy, or no treatment.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident HCV infection documented with a new
   positive result for HCV RNA and/or HCV antibodies. Cumulative incidence
   rates (95\% CI) of HCV infection were calculated assuming a Poisson
   distribution. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fit
   adjusting for age, sex, race, years of injection drug use, homelessness,
   and incarceration.
   RESULTS Baseline characteristics of the sample (n = 552) included median
   age of 23 (interquartile range, 20-26) years; 31.9\% female; 73.1\%
   white; 39.7\% who did not graduate from high school; and 69.2\% who were
   homeless. During the observation period of 680 person-years, 171
   incident cases of HCV infection occurred (incidence rate, 25.1 {[}95\%
   CI, 21.6-29.2] per 100 person-years). The rate ratio was significantly
   lower for participants who reported recent maintenance opioid agonist
   therapy (0.31 {[}95\% CI, 0.14-0.65]; P = .001) but not for those who
   reported recent non-opioid agonist forms of treatment (0.63 {[}95\% CI,
   0.37-1.08]; P = .09) or opioid agonist detoxification (1.45 {[}95\% CI,
   0.80-2.69]; P = .23). After adjustment for other covariates, maintenance
   opioid agonist therapy was associated with lower relative hazards for
   acquiring HCV infection over time (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.39 {[}95\%
   CI, 0.18-0.87]; P = .02).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort of young adult injection drug
   users, recent maintenance opioid agonist therapy was associated with a
   lower incidence of HCV infection. Maintenance treatment with methadone
   or buprenorphine for opioid use disorders may be an important strategy
   to prevent the spread of HCV infection among young injection drug users.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction We aimed to develop an innovative population-based method
   to estimate the health effect of influenza vaccination based on
   electronic medical records collected within a general practitioner
   (GP)-based influenza surveillance system in the Netherlands.
   Methods In each season between 2006/07 and 2015/16, we fitted multilevel
   Poisson regression models to compare GP consultation rates for
   clinically diagnosed influenza, acute respiratory infections (ARI),
   pneumonia, and lower back pain (as a control) between vaccinated vs.
   unvaccinated individuals. Season-specific relative risks and 95\%
   confidence intervals (CI) were pooled into summary risk ratio (SRR)
   through random-effects meta-analysis models. Analyses were stratified by
   patient age (<45, 45-59, 60-74, <greater than or equal to>75 years) and
   medical indication for the vaccine (any vs. none, subjects aged <= 60
   years only).
   Results Overall, 12.6\% and 21.4\% of study subjects were vaccinated
   because of their age only or because of an underlying medical condition.
   Vaccine uptake declined over time, especially among subjects aged <= 74
   years with medical indications for vaccination. Vaccinated individuals
   had significantly higher GP consultation rates for clinically diagnosed
   influenza (SRR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.12-1.38, p-value <0.001), ARI (SRR 1.33,
   95\% CI 1.27-1.39, p-value <0.001), pneumonia (SRR 1.27, 95\% CI
   1.19-1.36, p-value <0.001), and lower back pain (SRR 1.21, 95\% CI
   1.14-1.28, p-value <0.001) compared to unvaccinated individuals.
   Discussion Contrary to expectations, influenza vaccinees have GP
   consultation rates for clinically diagnosed influenza, ARI and pneumonia
   that are 24-33\% higher compared to unvaccinated individuals. The lower
   back pain finding suggests that the increase in consultation rates is
   partially caused by confounding. Importantly, considering the data are
   not laboratory-confirmed, our results cannot be linked directly to
   influenza, but only to respiratory illnesses in general.}},

Abstract = {{Solar steam generation, due to its capability of producing clean water
   directly by solar energy, is emerging as a promising eco-friendly and
   energy-efficient technology to address global challenges of water crisis
   and energy shortage. Although diverse materials and architectures have
   been explored to improve solar energy utilization, high efficiency in
   solar steam generation could be accomplished only with external optical
   and thermal management. For the first time, we report a deployable,
   three-dimensional (3D) origami-based solar steam generator capable of
   near full utilization of solar energy. This auxetic platform is designed
   based on Miura-ori tessellation and is able to efficiently recover
   radiative and convective heat loss as well as to trap solar energy via
   its periodic concavity pattern. The 3D solar steam generator device with
   a nanocarbon composite of graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes being
   photo thermal component in this work shows a very strong dependence
   between its solar energy efficiency and surface areal density. The
   device yields an extraordinary solar energy efficiency close to 100\%
   under 1 sun illumination at a highly folded configuration. The 3D
   origami device can withstand a great number of folding and unfolding
   cycles and shows unimpaired solar steam generation performances. The
   unique structural feature of the 3D origami structure offers a new
   insight into the future development of highly efficient and easily
   deployable solar steam generator.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reports results on the high performance of novel piezo-active
   composites based on relaxor-ferroelectric single crystals (SCs) of
   xPb(In0.5Nb0.5)O3yPb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3(1-x-y)PbTiO3. We present a
   comparative analysis of the electromechanical properties of 22-type
   composites based on single-domain SCs from symmetry classes 3m and mm2.
   The parallel connection of the layers, the presence of an auxetic
   polymer component and the appropriate orientation of the main
   crystallographic axes of the single-crystal layers lead to the
   development of large piezoelectric anisotropy and considerable
   hydrostatic piezoelectric response in comparison to the single-crystal
   component. Effective piezoelectric coefficients d(3j){*} and
   electromechanical coupling factors k(3j){*} of the composites obey the
   conditions d(33){*}/d(31){*}vertical bar >= 10, d(33){*}/vertical bar
   d(32){*}vertical bar >= 10,k(33){*}/vertical bar k(31){*}vertical bar >=
   10, and k(33){*}/vertical bar k(32){*} vertical bar >= 10 at k(33){*}
   approximate to 0.6. Hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficients
   d(h){*}approximate to 470 pC/N and g(h){*} similar to (10(2)10(3))mVm/N
   are one to two orders-of-magnitude larger than those of the
   single-crystal component, which make it attractive for various
   piezotechnical applications. The role of the elastic properties of the
   components is discussed in connection with the large hydrostatic
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Background Associations between HIV and schizophrenia in people with and
   without substance use disorders and the effect on timeliness of HIV
   diagnosis, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and treatment outcomes are
   poorly understood. We aimed to assess the association between HIV and
   schizophrenia and the effect on HIV treatment outcomes in people with
   and without substance use disorders.
   Methods We did a population-based cohort study with data from nationwide
   registries in Denmark to investigate the risk of schizophrenia after a
   diagnosis of HIV and the risk of HIV after a diagnosis of schizophrenia,
   accounting for substance misuse, timeliness of HIV diagnosis, and
   treatment success in relation to schizophrenia. We selected the cohort
   from people born in Denmark between Jan 1, 1955, and Dec 31, 1995, who
   we followed up from their 16th birthday or Jan 1, 1995 (whichever
   occurred last) until their death, emigration from Denmark, onset of
   schizophrenia, or Dec 31, 2011 (whichever came first). We estimated
   incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with Poisson and Cox regression, with
   adjustment for calendar period, and age and its interaction with sex.
   Findings We identified 2 786 286 individuals, of whom we included 2 646
   154 people in analyses of risk of schizophrenia diagnosis and 2 658 662
   people in analyses of risk of HIV diagnosis. In 35 353 633 person-years
   of follow up, HIV was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia
   (IRR 4.09, 95\% CI 2.73-5.83) and acute psychosis (7.15, 4.45-10.8); the
   IRR was highest within the first year of HIV diagnosis for both
   disorders (8.24, 2.95-17.7 and 12.7, 3.15-32.9, respectively).
   Schizophrenia was not associated with an increased risk of HIV in
   individuals without substance misuse disorders (IRR 1.42, 95\% CI
   0.81-2.27). The risk of schizophrenia in individuals with HIV decreased
   after ART (IRR 0.53, 0.32-0.87). The risk of acute psychosis did not
   differ between HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral
   regimens with and without efavirenz (IRR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.32-1.54). We
   recorded no differences in CD4 cell counts, time to ART, or viral
   suppression between individuals with schizophrenia with HIV and those
   without schizophrenia when substance use was taken into account. Between
   1999 and 2011, the mortality rate ratio comparing HIV-infected
   individuals with schizophrenia with HIV-negative individuals without
   schizophrenia was 25.8 (95\% CI 18.8-34.3).
   Interpretation Our findings emphasise the need for interventions to
   prevent HIV in people with schizophrenia, especially for those with
   substance use disorders, and for accessible mental health services for
   individuals with HIV.}},

Abstract = {{Background Indications for adjuvant endocrine treatment of breast cancer
   have gradually increased over the past several years. We aimed to define
   subgroups of patients who may or may not benefit from adjuvant endocrine
   therapy.
   Methods A population-based cohort of systemically untreated breast
   cancer patients (N = 3197) were identified within the registry of the
   Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG). The patients were node
   negative and had estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone
   receptor-positive tumors (except medullary tumors) and were further
   characterized by the following risk factors: aged 35-74 years (grouped
   into 5-year categories) at surgery, tumor size (<= 20 mm), and
   histopathology (grade 1 ductal carcinoma, grade 1 or 2 invasive lobular
   carcinoma, other or unknown histopathology). Standardized mortality
   ratios (SMRs) were calculated based on the mortality rate (observed
   number of deaths per 100 000 person-years) among patients relative to
   the mortality rate in the general population of women (expected number
   of deaths per 100 000 person-years). The association between
   standardized mortality ratio and risk factors were analyzed in
   univariate and multivariable Poisson regression models. All findings
   were validated in a subsequent DBCG cohort of breast cancer patients (N
   = 2710).
   Results The median follow-up after surgery was 14.8 years. In the study
   population there were 970 deaths compared with expected death of 737
   women, which was an excess mortality of 233 deaths (SMR = 1.32, 95\% CI
   = 1.24 to 1.40). Mortality rates were 2356 per 100 000 person-years in
   the study population and 1790 per 100 000 person-years in the general
   population of women. The mortality rate was associated with larger tumor
   size (11-20 mm tumors vs 1-10 mm tumors, SMR = 1.42, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = 1.31 to 1.53 vs SMR = 1.12, 95\% CI = 1.00 to 1.26).
   The mortality rate was also associated with age (35-59 years, SMR > 1)
   compared with that in the general population of age-matched women,
   except for a small subgroup of patients (aged 60-74 years, tumors <= 10
   mm, grade 1 ductal carcinoma, and grade 1 or 2 lobular carcinoma:
   adjusted relative risk = 1.02, 95\% CI = 0.89 to 1.16.).
   Conclusions A small subgroup of breast cancer patients who were 60 years
   or older and had hormone-responsive early-stage tumors up to 10 mm, and
   received no systemic adjuvant therapy, were not at increased risk of
   mortality compared with women in this age-group in the general
   population.}},

Title = {{RESONANCE IN ROCK MASS AS THE KEY REASON OF GEODYNAMIC PHENOMENA}},
Journal = {{MINING OF MINERAL DEPOSITS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{46-58}},
Abstract = {{Purpose is to develop deformation criterion or predecessors of
   geodynamic phenomena within rock mass relying upon the systemized
   experimental data concerning rock behaviour in a volumetric field of
   compressive stress.
   Methods. Experiments as for rock deformation and failure in a volumetric
   stress state were carried out with the help of a device of non-uniform
   volumetric compression. The device was designed by Donetsk Institute for
   Physics and Engineering (DonlPhE) of the NAS of Ukraine. Volumetric
   deformations and share deformations, elastic parameters, parameters of a
   type of deformation state and stress state of Lode Nadai, and Lode
   angles were determined separately for each load grade taking into
   consideration corresponding increase in deformations. Sudden arching and
   its characteristic features were observed in longwall 2 of inclined
   drift of l(1) seam in Kapitalna mine.
   Findings. It has been demonstrated that rock are classic auxetics in
   which elastic factors change their values and signs. It has been
   determined that the characteristic deformations, in terms of which
   elastic characteristics change their values, are quantized and constant
   for each material. Four characteristic stages, inherent to all rocks
   despite their stress state type and comprehensive pressure value, have
   been singled out during deformation. It has been defined that jump of
   amplitude of linear and shear deformations, resulting from double vortex
   and wave resonance in terms of velocity, dimensions of structures and
   frequency (stage 3), is a failure predecessor. Increase in minimum
   relative deformations (i.e. oscillations of a working face of a seam)
   and in maximum relative deformations (i.e. oscillations of roof or walls
   of a mine working) up to several percent have been proposed as the
   failure criterion.
   Originality. It has been determined for the first time that in the
   context of volumetric stress state, deformation increase is of
   alternative nature; elastic characteristics of rocks are not constants
   of a material varying in terms of a value and a sign during mechanical
   loading and shear deformations are of rotational nature.
   Practical implications. Resonance increase in the amplitude of maximum,
   minimum, and shear deformation growth is a criterion of total failure
   and dynamic failure in particular which can be used in practice as a
   predecessor of a failure or its prognostic criterion.}},

Title = {{A two-part mixed-effects model for analyzing clustered time-to-event
   data with clumping at zero}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{187}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objective: In longitudinal epidemiological studies
   consisting of a baseline stage and a follow-up stage, observations at
   the baseline stage may contain a countable proportion of negative
   responses. The time-to-event outcomes of those observations
   corresponding to negative responses at baseline can be denoted as zeros,
   which are excluded from standard survival analysis. Consequently, some
   important information on these subjects is therefore lost in the
   analysis. Furthermore, subjects are often clustered within hospitals,
   communities or health service centers, resulting in correlated
   observations. The framework of the two-part model has been developed and
   utilized widely to analyze semi-continuous data or count data with
   excess zeros, but its application to clustered time-to-event data with
   clumping at zero remains sparse.
   Methods: A two-part mixed-effects modeling approach was proposed. A
   logistic mixed-effects regression model was used in the first part to
   determine factors associated with the prevalence of the baseline event
   of interest. Parametric frailty models (including Weibull, exponential,
   log-logistic and log-normal) were used in the second part to assess
   associations between exposures and time-to-event outcomes. Correlated
   random effects were incorporated within the two regression models to
   accommodate the inherent correlation within each clustering unit and the
   correlation between the two parts. As an illustrative example, the
   method was applied to exclusive breastfeeding data from a
   community-based prospective cohort study in Nepal.
   Results: A significantly positive correlation between the baseline
   prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding
   duration was confirmed (rho =0.67 , P < 0.001). The correlated two-part
   model outperformed the independent two-part model (likelihood ratio test
   statistic =8.6, df =1, P= 0.003).
   Conclusions: The proposed approach makes full use of all available
   information at baseline and during the follow-up, compared to the
   conventional survival analysis. In addition to breastfeeding studies,
   the method can be applied to other research areas where clustered
   time-to-event data with clumping at zero arise. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{With an estimated antibody prevalence of 0.7\% in the low-risk
   population, hepatitis C virus (HCV) endemicity in Switzerland is low. We
   reviewed data from mandatory hepatitis C surveillance for 1988-2015 in
   order to describe the evolution of acute HCV infections and newly
   reported non-acute cases, and their epidemiological features. Crude and
   stratified annual incidence and notification rates and rate ratios were
   calculated using Poisson regression. Acute HCV incidence peaked in 2002
   at 1.8 cases per 100,000 population, then declined sharply, levelling at
   around 0.7/100,000 from 2006. Notification rates for non-acute HCV cases
   peaked in 1999 (38.6/100,000), decreasing to 16.8/100,000 in 2015. Men
   constituted 65.5\% of acute cases and 60.4\% of non-acute cases. During
   the periods 1992-1995 and 2012-2015, the median age of acute cases
   increased from 28 to 37 and of non-acute cases from 32 to 48 years. The
   exposure leading to most acute (90.4\%) and non-acute (71.9\%) cases was
   presumably in Switzerland. Despite a sharp decrease since 2000,
   injecting drugs was the main reported exposure for both acute (63.8\%)
   and non-acute (66.6\%) cases, with a known exposure, followed by sexual
   contact with an infected person (18.9\% and 10.3\% respectively). Among
   all acute cases, the number of men who have sex with men increased
   sharply after the mid-2000s, totalling 41 during 2012-2015 (25.7\%).
   Although the HCV epidemic peaked in 2000 - probably as a result of
   measures to control iatrogenic and percutaneous transmission -
   Switzerland must maintain prevention and surveillance.}},

Title = {{The association between dengue incidences and provincial-level weather
   variables in Thailand from 2001 to 2014}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic pose significant burdens in many tropical
   countries. Dengue incidences have perpetually increased, leading to an
   annual (uncertain) peak. Dengue cases cause an enormous public health
   problem in Thailand because there is no anti-viral drug against the
   dengue virus. Searching for means to reduce the dengue incidences is a
   challenging and appropriate strategy for primary prevention in a dengue
   outbreak. This study constructs the best predictive model from past
   statistical dengue incidences at the provincial level and studies the
   relationships among dengue incidences and weather variables. We
   conducted experiments for 65 provinces (out of 77 provinces) in Thailand
   since there is no dengue information for the remaining provinces.
   Predictive models were constructed using weekly data during 2001-2014.
   The training set are data during 2001-2013, and the test set is the data
   from 2014. Collected data were separated into two parts: current dengue
   cases as the dependent variable, and weather variables and previous
   dengue cases as the independent variables. Eight weather variables are
   used in our models: average pressure, maximum temperature, minimum
   temperature, average humidity, precipitation, vaporization, wind
   direction, wind power. Each weather variable includes the current week
   and one to three weeks of lag time. A total of 32 independent weather
   variables are used for each province. The previous one to three weeks of
   dengue cases are also used as independent variables. There is a total of
   35 independent variables. Predictive models were constructed using five
   methods: Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, quasi
   likelihood regression, ARIMA(3,1,4) and SARIMA(2,0,1)(0,2,0). The best
   model is determined by combinations of 1-12 variables, which are
   232,989,800 models for each province. We construct a total of
   15,144,337,000 models. The best model is selected by the average from
   high to low of the coefficient of determination (R2) and the lowest root
   mean square error (RMSE). From our results, the one-week lag previous
   case variable is the most frequent in 55 provinces out of a total of 65
   provinces (coefficient of determinations with a minimum of 0.257 and a
   maximum of 0.954, average of 0.6383, 95\% CI: 0.57313 to 0.70355). The
   most influential weather variable is precipitation, which is used in
   most of the provinces, followed by wind direction, wind power, and
   barometric pressure. The results confirm the common knowledge that
   dengue incidences occur most often during the rainy season. It also
   shows that wind direction, wind power, and barometric pressure also have
   influences on the number of dengue cases. These three weather variables
   may help adult mosquitos to survive longer and spread dengue. In
   conclusion, The most influential factor for further cases is the number
   of dengue cases. However, weather variables are also needed to obtain
   better results. Predictions of the number of dengue cases should be done
   locally, not at the national level. The best models of different
   provinces use different sets of weather variables. Our model has an
   accuracy that is sufficient for the real prediction of future dengue
   incidences, to prepare for and protect against severe dengue outbreaks.}},

Title = {{Pregnant? Validity of the pregnancy checkbox on death certificates in
   four states, and characteristics associated with pregnancy checkbox
   errors}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Maternal mortality rates in the United States appear to be
   increasing. One potential reason may be increased identification of
   maternal deaths after the addition of a pregnancy checkbox to the death
   certificate. In 2016, 4 state health departments (Georgia, Louisiana,
   Michigan, and Ohio) implemented a pregnancy checkbox quality assurance
   pilot, with technical assistance provided by the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention. The pilot aimed to improve accuracy of the
   pregnancy checkbox on death certificates and resultant state maternal
   mortality estimates.
   OBJECTIVE: To estimate the validity of the pregnancy checkbox on the
   death certificate, and to describe characteristics associated with
   errors using 2016 data from a 4-state quality assurance pilot.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Potential pregnancy-associated deaths were
   identified by linking death certificates with birth or fetal death
   certificates from within 1 year preceding death or by pregnancy checkbox
   status. Death certificates that indicated that the decedent was pregnant
   within 1 year of death via the pregnancy checkbox, but that did not link
   to a birth or fetal death certificate, were referred for active
   follow-up to confirm pregnancy status by either death certifier
   confirmation or medical record review. Descriptive statistics and 95\%
   confidence intervals were used to examine the distributions of
   demographic characteristics by pregnancy confirmation category
   (confirmed pregnant, confirmed not pregnant, and unable to confirm). We
   compared the proportion confirmed pregnant and confirmed not pregnant
   within age, race/ethnicity, pregnancy checkbox category, and certifier
   type categories using a Wald test of proportions. Binomial and Poisson
   regression models were used to estimate prevalence ratios for having an
   incorrect pregnancy checkbox (false positive, false negative) by age
   group, race/ethnicity, pregnancy checkbox category, and certifier type.
   RESULTS: Among 467 potential pregnancy-associated deaths, 335 (72\%)
   were confirmed pregnant via linkage to a birth or fetal death
   certificate, certifier confirmation, or review of medical records. A
   total of 97 women (21\%) were confirmed not pregnant (false positives)
   and 35 (7\%) were unable to be confirmed. Women confirmed pregnant were
   significantly younger than women confirmed not pregnant (P < .001).
   Deaths certified by coroners and medical examiners were more likely to
   be confirmed pregnant than confirmed not pregnant (P = .04). The
   association between decedent age category and false-positive status
   followed a dose-response relationship (P < .001), with increasing
   prevalence ratios for each increase in age category. Death certificates
   of non-Hispanic black women were more likely to be false positive,
   compared with non-Hispanic white women (prevalence ratio, 1.41; 95\%
   confidence interval, 1.01, 1.96). The sensitivity of the pregnancy
   checkbox among these 4 states in 2016 was 62\% and the positive
   predictive value was 68\%.
   CONCLUSION: We provide a multi-state analysis of the validity of the
   pregnancy checkbox and highlight a need for more accurate reporting of
   pregnancy status on death certificates. States and other jurisdictions
   may increase the accuracy of their data used to calculate maternal
   mortality rates by implementing quality assurance processes.}},

Title = {{Multifunctionality of particulate composites via cross-property maps}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{2}},

Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Closed-form analytical expressions for the effective electrical
   (thermal) conductivity and elastic moduli of a wide class of
   three-dimensional isotropic particulate composites (dispersions) for all
   phase contrasts and volume fractions have been previously formulated.
   These property estimates were extracted from exact strong-contrast
   expansions that incorporate complete microstructural information. In
   this paper, we employ these analytical expressions to derive and apply
   ``cross-property maps{''} that connect combinations of pairs of the
   aforementioned effective transport and elastic properties to one another
   for a wide class of dispersions in which the inclusions can have
   different shapes and sizes and are spatially distributed in a matrix
   with varying degrees of order/disorder. We illustrate cross-property
   maps for a variety of cases (e.g., incompressible or compressible
   composites with conducting/insulating inclusions that may be rigid or
   compliant or auxetic) for high inclusion volume fractions. All of the
   cross-property maps that involve the effective conductivity translate
   immediately into equivalent results for the effective dielectric
   constant, magnetic permeability, or diffusion coefficient because they
   are mathematically analogous. We discuss an example that enables us to
   design a disordered dispersion with desired values of the effective
   dielectric constant and effective Young's modulus. Cross-property maps
   and their extensions will facilitate the rational design of particulate
   media with different desirable multifunctional characteristics.
   Moreover, our investigation has implications for the application of
   machine-learning and other data-driven approaches for multifunctional
   materials discovery.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the shape memory and tensile property of 3D-printed
   sinusoidal sample/nylon composite for various thickness and cycles.
   Sinusoidal pattern of five thicknesses: 0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.6 mm, 0.8 mm,
   and 1.0 mm were 3D-printed on nylon fabric by the fused deposition
   modeling (FDM) 3D printer using shape memory thermoplastic polyurethane
   (SMTPU). Afterward, shape memory and tensile property was investigated
   up to 50 shape memory cycles. The study found that 3D-printed sinusoidal
   sample/nylon composite had a 100\% shape recovery ratio for various
   thicknesses up to 50 cycles. The average shape recovery rate gradually
   decreased from 3.0 degrees/s to 0.7 degrees/s whereas the response time
   gradually increased with the increase of a 3D-printed pattern thickness.
   The stress and initial modulus gradually increased with the increase of
   the cycle's number. Thus, the shape memory property had a similar
   tendency for various cycles whereas the tensile property gradually
   increased with the increase of the cycle number. Moreover, this study
   demonstrated that this 3D-printed sinusoidal sample/nylon composite can
   go through more than 50 cycles without losing its tensile or shape
   memory property. This 3D-printed sinusoidal sample/nylon composite has
   vast potential as smart, reinforced, and protective clothing that
   requires complex three-dimensional shapes.}},

Abstract = {{We use molecular dynamics simulations to study attractive interactions
   and the underlying ionic correlations between parallel like-charged rods
   in the absence of additional salt. For a generic bulk system of rods we
   identify a reduction of short-range repulsions as the origin of a
   negative osmotic coefficient. The counterions show signs of a weak
   three-dimensional order in the attractive regime only once the
   rod-imposed charge inhomogeneities are divided out. We also treat the
   case of attraction between a single pair of rods for a few selected line
   charge densities and rod radii, Measurements of the individual
   contributions to the force between close rods are studied as a function
   of Bjerrum length. We find that even though the total force is always
   attractive at sufficiently high Bjerrum length, the electrostatic
   contribution can ultimately become repulsive. We also measure azimuthal
   and longitudinal correlation functions to answer the question how
   condensed ions are distributed with respect to each other and to the
   neighboring rod. For instance, we show that the prevalent image of
   mutually interlocked ions is qualitatively correct, even though
   modifications due to thermal fluctuations are usually strong.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{Natural nonlinear materials, e.g., biological materials and polymers,
   are mechanically weak. It has been a major challenge to develop a
   nonlinear material with potential mechanical applications. Here, we
   develop a nonlinear elastic metamaterial with giant and
   tailorable-nonreciprocal elastic moduli. The metamaterial is designed
   with a microstructural axial asymmetry, which activated nonlinear
   microstructural deforma- tions in the axial direction and
   microstructural residual moments. This gives a robust load dependence of
   the nonlinear elastic modulus (i.e., secant modulus). The nonlinear
   elastic modulus is observed decreasing or increasing depending on, both,
   the direction and magnitude of the applied load. The nonlinear elastic
   modulus is increased by approximately 400\% upon switching the load
   direction and the activation of a microstructural buckling. Thus, the
   nonlinear elastic modulus is generally nonreciprocal, and the
   meta-material disobeys the Maxwell-Betti reciprocal theorem. This
   metamaterial is demonstrated by means of experimental and analytical
   mechanics. Various material samples are experimentally tested and their
   non-reciprocal elastic moduli are measured. In addition, the relation
   between the material's nonreciprocity and its topological mechanics is
   defined. The developed metamaterial can find many important mechanical
   applications such as making mechanical resonators with enhanced mass
   sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Rapidly decreasing cost of next-generation sequencing has led to the
   recent availability of large-scale RNA-seq data, that empowers the
   analysis of gene expression variability, in addition to gene expression
   means. In this paper, we present the MDSeq, based on the coefficient of
   dispersion, to provide robust and computationally efficient analysis of
   both gene expression means and variability on RNA-seq counts. The MDSeq
   utilizes a novel reparametrization of the negative binomial to provide
   flexible generalized linear models (GLMs) on both the mean and
   dispersion. We address challenges of analyzing large-scale RNA-seq data
   via several new developments to provide a comprehensive toolset that
   models technical excess zeros, identifies outliers efficiently, and
   evaluates differential expressions at biologically interesting levels.
   We evaluated performances of the MDSeq using simulated data when the
   ground truths are known. Results suggest that the MDSeq often
   outperforms current methods for the analysis of gene expression mean and
   variability. Moreover, the MDSeq is applied in two real RNA-seq studies,
   in which we identified functionally relevant genes and gene pathways.
   Specifically, the analysis of gene expression variability with the MDSeq
   on the GTEx human brain tissue data has identified pathways associated
   with common neurodegenerative disorders when gene expression means were
   conserved.}},

Title = {{Effective elastic mechanical properties of single layer graphene sheets}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{The elastic moduli of single layer graphene sheet (SLGS) have been a
   subject of intensive research in recent years. Calculations of these
   effective properties range from molecular dynamic simulations to use of
   structural mechanical models. On the basis of mathematical models and
   calculation methods, several different results have been obtained and
   these are available in the literature. Existing mechanical models employ
   Euler-Bernoulli beams rigidly jointed to the lattice atoms. In this
   paper we propose truss-type analytical models and an approach based on
   cellular material mechanics theory to describe the in-plane linear
   elastic properties of the single layer graphene sheets. In the cellular
   material model, the C-C bonds are represented by equivalent mechanical
   beams having full stretching, hinging, bending and deep shear beam
   deformation mechanisms. Closed form expressions for Young's modulus, the
   shear modulus and Poisson's ratio for the graphene sheets are derived in
   terms of the equivalent mechanical C-C bond properties. The models
   presented provide not only quantitative information about the mechanical
   properties of SLGS, but also insight into the equivalent mechanical
   deformation mechanisms when the SLGS undergoes small strain uniaxial and
   pure shear loading. The analytical and numerical results from finite
   element simulations show good agreement with existing numerical values
   in the open literature. A peculiar marked auxetic behaviour for the C-C
   bonds is identified for single graphene sheets under pure shear loading.}},

Abstract = {{Results of systematic numerical studies are presented which suggest that
   suitable alternative wall constructions may lead to elastic
   load-carrying capacities of light-weight structures which significantly
   exceed those of conventional monocoque constructions, and that in

   imperfection-sensitivity. Two kinds of wall modifications are
   considered: a hybrid wall construction where the skin of a light-weight
   structure is coated with a low-density material, and nonhomogeneous - in
   particular lattice and biaxially corrugated - wall constructions. The
   paper focuses on the elastic load-carrying behavior of shell- and
   plate-like structures, and structural efficiency is assessed on the
   basis of their bifurcation buckling resistance while other design
   criteria, such as e.g. stiffness and plasticity, are not taken into

   joint areas}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Developing new generation wearable electronics with skin-like
   stretchability and conformability has become the research hotspot in
   many areas, such as bio-sensoring, communication and robotics. In this
   study, a novel design and manufacturing method was proposed to develop
   wearable electronics, which could perform a similar deformation as the
   target skin surface during the rotation of joint. Considering the
   nonuniform auxetic deformation behaviour of the skin around joint areas,
   the designed electronics should also have the same Poisson's ratio (PR)
   distribution. Re-entrant honeycomb structure was chosen to obtain
   tuneable PR, by changing the interior angel of each unit cell. By
   mapping unit cells with different PR to the target surface, the obtained
   structure would have the same mechanical property and deformation
   behaviour as the covered skin. Consequently, there would be little sheer
   stress at the connection areas between wearable electronics and human
   skin, which would surely increase the attachment stability. Besides, the
   conformability of the device could also be generated. PloyJet process
   was introduced to fabricate the flexible substrate, and silver ink was
   printed directly on the substrate with directink-writing (DIW)
   technology. Conductive wire with `wavy' structure was manufactured by
   this PolyJet-DIW process, and it had shown a much better stretchability
   than the common straight-line structure. Furthermore, wearable
   electronics that suitable for a person-specific elbow was developed.
   Both the conformability and conductivity were tested, and all results
   had shown much better performance than traditional wearable electronics
   with uniform structures.}},

Abstract = {{The chiral effects cannot be described by means of the classical

   generalized plane strain problem in the analysis of thermal stresses in
   chiral elastic beams. First, we investigate the effects of a thermal
   field which is linear in the axial coordinate. It is shown that this
   temperature variation produces extension, bending, torsion, flexure and
   a plane deformation. Then, we study the deformation of the beam when the
   thermal field is a polynomial of degree m (m1) in the axial coordinate.
   The solution is reduced to the solving of some two-dimensional problems.
   The method is used to solve the problem of a circular cylinder subjected
   to a temperature that is independent of the axial coordinate.}},

Title = {{Additive manufacturing assisted investment casting: A low-cost method to
   fabricate periodic metallic cellular lattices}},
Journal = {{ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{33}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Metallic cellular solids are a class of materials known for their high
   specific mechanical properties, being desirable in applications where a
   combination of high strength or stiffness and low density are important.
   These lightweight materials are often stochastic and manufactured by
   foaming or casting. If regular (periodic) lattice structures are
   desired, they may be manufactured by metallic additive manufacturing
   techniques. However, these have characteristic issues, such as un-melted
   powders, porosity and heterogeneous microstructures. This study reports
   a novel low-cost route for producing regular lattice structures by an
   additive manufacturing assisted investment casting technique. Fused
   filament fabrication is used to produce the lattice structure pattern
   which is infiltrated with plaster. The pattern is then burnt off and the
   aluminum is cast in vacuum. In this way we can manufacture
   non-stochastic metallic lattices having fine struts/ribs (0.6 mm
   cross-section using a 0.4 mm nozzle) and relative densities down to
   0.036. X-ray micro computed tomography (mu CT) showed that as-cast A356
   Aluminium alloy frameworks have high dimensional tolerances and fine
   detail control. Frameworks based on units of six connected struts
   ranging from intruding (auxetic) to protruding (hexagonal) strut angles
   are studied. Vertical struts are finer than expected, reducing their
   moment of area which could impact their compressive strength. This new,
   low cost, route for producing high precision metallic cellular lattices
   offers an attractive alternative to other additive manufacturing
   techniques (e.g. selective laser and electron beam melting).}},

   from the Fukushima health management survey}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},

Abstract = {{Background: Socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle-related factors are
   determinants of subjective health. However, changes in SES are
   inevitable in times of natural disaster, while lifestyle-related factors
   remain modifiable. The aim of this study was to use a cross-sectional
   approach to examine lifestyle-related factors that may attenuate the
   negative impact of disaster-induced changes in SES on poor subjective
   health.
   Methods: We analyzed 33,350 men and women aged 20-64 years who were
   living in evacuation zones due to the radiation accident in Fukushima,
   Japan. Disaster-induced changes in SES were defined by living
   arrangements and working conditions. Using Poisson regression analysis
   adjusted for confounders (model 1) and lifestyle-related factors as
   intermediate variables (model 2), we compared the prevalence ratios
   (PRs) of poor subjective health of participants who did not undergo
   disaster-induced changes in SES (did not become unemployed, income did
   not decrease, and living in relative's home/own home) with that of
   participants who did undergo disaster-induced changes in SES (became
   unemployed, decreased income, or lived in an evacuation shelter,
   temporary housing, or rental housing/apartment). We calculated the
   percentage of excess risks explained by lifestyle-related factors as
   follows: ((PRmodel (1) - PRmodel 2)/(PRmodel 1-1)) x 100.
   Results: Disaster-induced changes in SES were significantly associated
   with poor subjective health. The PRs (95\% CIs) among participants who
   underwent disaster-induced changes in SES were 2.02 (1.81-2.24) for men
   and 1.80 (1. 65-1.97) for women. After adjusting for lifestyle-related
   factors, we found that the PRs in men and women were remarkably
   attenuated, decreasing to 1.56 (1.40-1.73) and 1.43 (1.31-1.55),
   respectively. Controlling for lifestyle-related factors resulted in PR
   attenuation by 45.1\% (men) and 46.3\% (women). Satisfaction of sleep
   and participation in recreation and community activity particularly
   contributed to this attenuation.
   Conclusions: While disaster-induced changes in SES are unavoidable,
   lifestyle-related factors have the potential to attenuate the impact of
   these changes on poor subjective health.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   Young women in South Africa are highly affected by sexually transmitted
   infections (STI), like C. trachomatis (CT) and N. gonorrhoeae (NG). We
   aimed to estimate the incidence of CT and NG, and its determinants,
   among young women from the Western Cape, South Africa, participating in
   an HPV vaccine trial (the EVRI study).
   Methods
   HIV-negative women aged 16-24 years were enrolled between October 2012
   and July 2013. At enrolment and month 6 participants were screened for
   CT and NG (Anyplex CT/NG real-time detection method). A questionnaire on
   demographic and sexual history characteristics was completed at
   enrolment and month 7. Treatment for CT and/or NG was offered to
   infected participants. Incidence rates (IR) of CT and NG were estimated.
   Determinants of incident CT and NG infections were assessed using
   Poisson regression.
   Results
   365 women were tested for CT and/or NG at least twice. Prevalence of CT
   and NG at baseline was 33.7\% and 10.4\%, respectively. Prevalence of
   co-infection with CT and NG was 7.1\%. During 113.3 person-years (py),
   48 incident CT infections were diagnosed (IR = 42.4 per 100 py, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 31.9-56.2). Twenty-nine incident NG were
   diagnosed during 139.3 py (IR = 20.8 per 100 py, 95\%CI 14.5-29.9).
   Prevalent CT infection at baseline was associated with incident CT
   (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 5.8, 95\%CI 3.0-11.23. More than
   three lifetime sex partners increased the risk for incident NG (3-4
   partners aIRR = 7.3, 95\%CI 2.1-26.0; >= 5 partners aIRR = 4.3, 95\%CI
   1.1-17.5).
   Conclusions The IR of bacterial STIs among young women in the Western
   Cape is very high. Besides being previously infected and a higher
   lifetime number of sex partners, no other risk factors were found for CT
   and NG, suggesting that the majority of these women were at risk. This
   indicates the need for intensified prevention of STIs as well as
   screening and treatment programs to increase sexual health in this
   region.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundMen who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW)
   are disproportionately impacted by HIV and may face barriers to HIV
   status disclosure with negative ramifications for HIV prevention and
   care. We evaluated HIV status disclosure to sexual partners, HIV
   treatment outcomes, and stigma patterns of MSM and TGW in Abuja and
   Lagos, Nigeria.MethodsPreviously-diagnosed MSM and TGW living with HIV
   who enrolled in the TRUST/RV368 cohort from March 2013 to August 2018
   were asked, ``Have you told your (male/female) sexual partners (MSP/FSP)
   that you are living with HIV?{''} In separate analyses, robust Poisson
   regression models were used to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and 95\%
   confidence intervals (95\% CIs) for characteristics associated with HIV
   status disclosure to MSP and FSP. Self-reported stigma indicators were
   compared between groups.ResultsOf 493 participants living with HIV, 153
   (31.0\%) had disclosed their HIV status to some or all MSP since being
   diagnosed. Among 222 with FSP, 34 (15.3\%) had disclosed to some or all
   FSP. Factors independently associated with disclosure to MSP included
   living in Lagos (RR 1.58 {[}95\% CI 1.14-2.20]) and having viral load
   <50 copies/mL (RR 1.67 {[}95\% CI 1.24-2.25]). Disclosure to FSP was
   more common among participants who were working in entertainment
   industries (RR 6.25 {[}95\% CI 1.06-36.84]) or as drivers/laborers (RR
   6.66 {[}95\% CI 1.10-40.36], as compared to unemployed) and also among
   those married/cohabiting (RR 3.95 {[}95\% CI 1.97-7.91], as compared to
   single) and prescribed ART (RR 2.27 {[}95\% CI 1.07-4.83]). No
   differences in self-reported stigma indicators were observed by
   disclosure status to MSP but disclosure to FSP was associated with a
   lower likelihood of ever having been assaulted (26.5\% versus 45.2\%,
   p=0.042).ConclusionsHIV status disclosure to sexual partners was
   uncommon among Nigerian MSM and TGW living with HIV but was associated
   with improved HIV care outcomes. Disclosure was not associated with
   substantially increased experiences of stigma. Strategies to encourage
   HIV status disclosure may improve HIV management outcomes in these
   highly-marginalized populations with a high burden of HIV infection.}},

Abstract = {{The strategic replacement of the stiff core with compliant cellular
   materials in regions of a composite sandwich panel has the potential to
   integrate a shock absorbing functionality into an otherwise rigid
   structure. This work describes the development and preliminary analysis
   of 3D printed thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) energy absorbing cellular
   architectures.
   A parametric study was undertaken to assess the compressive behaviour
   and energy absorbing characteristics of potential cellular inclusions
   with both hexagonal and multi re-entrant, auxetic topologies. In our
   study, we investigate the effect of varying the size and internal angles
   of unit cells on the compressive response of the global arrays, up to
   strains of 75\%.
   Samples are loaded globally and locally in compression with flat plates
   and cylindrical indenters, respectively; the cell collapse behaviour for
   both cases are captured. The energy absorbing capability of the
   macroscopic cellular structures was analysed through the generation of a
   series of energy absorption diagrams derived directly from the
   stress-strain curves obtained.
   In our study, it was found that by varying the loading conditions on the
   3D printed polyurethane cellular arrays, the cell buckling modes could
   be controlled, with the promotion of different collapse behaviour
   leading to unique energy absorption profiles, at large elastic strains.
   This study has shown the potential for novel 3D printed architectures
   for energy absorption. The ongoing effective characterisation of
   material and structure will ultimately facilitate in the design of
   recoverable, hyperelastic cellular structures with energy absorption
   profiles tailored to specific impact events.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Little is known regarding barriers to hepatitis C virus
   (HCV) treatment among people who inject drugs (PWID) in low-resource
   settings, particularly in the era of direct-acting antiviral therapies.
   Methods: Between March, 2015 August, 2016, a cross-sectional survey was
   administered to community-based PWID in Chennai, India to examine the
   HCV care continuum and associated barriers. Adjusted prevalence ratios
   (APR) were estimated by multivariable Poisson regression with robust
   variance.
   Results: All participants were male (n = 541); 152 participants had HCV
   mono-infection and 61 participants had HIV/HCV co-infection. Only one
   HCV mono-infected and one HIV/HCV co-infected participant was linked to
   HCV care. Overall, there was moderate knowledge of HCV disease but poor
   knowledge of HCV treatment. Higher total knowledge scores were
   negatively associated with HIV/HCV co-infection (vs. HCV
   mono-infection), though this was not statistically significant in
   adjusted analysis (APR = 0.71 {[}95\%CI = 0.47-1.061). Participants >=
   45 years (APR = 0.73 {[}95\%CI = 0.58-0.92]) and participants with
   HIV/HCV co-infection (APR = 0.64 {[}95\%CI = 0.47-0.87]) were less
   willing to take weekly interferon injections for 12 weeks. Willingness
   to undergo HCV treatment improved with decreasing duration of therapy,
   higher perceived efficacy, and use of pills vs. interferon, though
   willingness to use interferon improved with decreasing duration of
   therapy. Most participants preferred daily visits to a clinic for HCV
   treatment versus receiving a month's supply. Participants >= 45 years
   (vs. < 45 years; APR = 0.70 {[}95\%CI = 0.56-0.88]) and participants
   with HIV/HCV co-infection (APR = 0.75 {[}95\%CI = 0.57-0.98]) were less
   likely to intend on seeking HCV care. Common reasons for not having
   already seen a provider for HCV treatment differed by HIV status, and
   included low perceived need for treatment (HCV-mono-infected), competing
   money/health priorities and costs/fears about treatment
   (HIV/HCV-co-infected).
   Conclusion: Residual gaps in HCV knowledge and continuing negative
   perceptions related to interferon-based therapy highlight the need to
   scale-up educational initiatives. Readiness for HCV treatment was
   particularly low among HIV/HCV co-infected and older PWID, emphasizing
   the importance of tailored treatment strategies.}},

   service-delivery to improve health and resilience of adolescents living
   with HIV and their caregivers: Findings from a prospective cohort study
   in Zambia}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Children and youth are profoundly impacted groups in Zambia's HIV
   epidemic. To evaluate delivery of integrated psychosocial, economic
   strengthening, and clinical services to HIV-affected households through
   the Zambia Family (ZAMFAM) Project, a prospective cohort study compared
   socio-economic, psychosocial, and health outcomes among ZAMFAM
   beneficiaries to non-beneficiaries.
   Methods
   In July-October 2017, 544 adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) aged 5-17
   years and their adult caregivers were recruited from Central (ZAMFAM
   implementation sites) and Eastern (non-intervention sites) Provinces.
   Structured interviews at baseline and one-year follow-up assessed
   household characteristics, socio-economic wellbeing, and health service
   utilization. Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations
   measured one-year changes in key health and socio-economic indicators,
   comparing ZAMFAM beneficiaries to non-beneficiaries.
   Results
   Overall, 494 households completed two rounds of assessment (retention
   rate: 91\%) Among ALHIV, improvements in current antiretroviral therapy
   use over time (Adjusted Prevalence Rate Ratio {[}aPRR] = 1.06, 95\%
   Confidence Interval {[}95\% CI]: 1.01-1.11) and reductions in
   non-household labor (aPRR = 0.44, 95\% CI: 0.20-0.99) were significantly
   larger among ZAMFAM beneficiaries than non-beneficiaries. For
   caregivers, receiving ZAMFAM services was associated with significant
   reductions in HIV-related stigma (aPRR = 0.49, 95\% CI: 0.28-0.88) and
   perceived negative community attitudes towards HIV (aPRR = 0.77, 95\%
   CI: 0.62-0.96). Improvements in caregiver capacity to pay for unexpected
   (aPRR = 1.54, 95\% CI: 1.17-2.04) and food-related expenses (aPRR =
   1.48, 95\% CI: 1.16-1.90), as well as shared decision-making authority
   in household spending (aPRR = 1.41, 95\% CI: 1.04-1.93) and
   self-reported good or very good health status (aPRR = 1.46, 95\% CI:
   1.14-1.87), were also significantly larger among ZAMFAM beneficiaries.
   Conclusions
   Significant improvements in caregivers' financial capacity were observed
   among households receiving ZAMFAM services, with few changes in health
   or wellbeing among ALHIV. Integrated service-delivery approaches like
   ZAMFAM may yield observable socio-economic improvements in the
   short-term. Strengthening community-based delivery of psychosocial and
   health support to ALHIV is encouraged.}},

Title = {{Affective and Substance Abuse Disorders Following Abortion by Pregnancy
   Intention in the United States: A Longitudinal Cohort Study}},
Journal = {{MEDICINA-LITHUANIA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Psychological outcomes following termination
   of wanted pregnancies have not previously been studied. Does excluding
   such abortions affect estimates of psychological distress following
   abortion? To address this question this study examines long-term
   psychological outcomes by pregnancy intention (wanted or unwanted)
   following induced abortion relative to childbirth in the United States.
   Materials and Methods: Panel data on a nationally-representative cohort
   of 3935 ever-pregnant women assessed at mean age of 15, 22, and 28 years
   were examined from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to
   Adult Health (Add Health). Relative risk (RR) and incident rate ratios
   (IRR) for time-dynamic mental health outcomes, conditioned by pregnancy
   intention and abortion exposure, were estimated from population-averaged
   longitudinal logistic and Poisson regression models, with extensive
   adjustment for sociodemographic differences, pregnancy and mental health
   history, and other confounding factors. Outcomes were assessed using the
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Version 4, American Psychiatric
   Association (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria or another validated index for
   suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety (affective problems); drug
   abuse, opioid abuse, alcohol abuse, and cannabis abuse (substance abuse
   problems); and summary total disorders. Results: Women who terminated
   one or more wanted pregnancies experienced a 43\% higher risk of
   affective problems (RR 1.69, 95\% CI 1.3-2.2) relative to childbirth,
   compared to women terminating only unwanted pregnancies (RR 1.18, 95\%
   CI 1.0-1.4). Risks of depression (RR 2.22, 95\% CI 1.3-3.8) and
   suicidality (RR 3.44 95\% CI 1.5-7.7) were especially elevated with
   wanted pregnancy abortion. Relative risk of substance abuse disorders
   with any abortion was high, at about 2.0, but unaffected by pregnancy
   intention. Excluding wanted pregnancies artifactually reduced estimates
   of affective disorders by 72\% from unity, substance abuse disorders by
   11\% from unity, and total disorders by 21\% from unity. Conclusions:
   Excluding wanted pregnancies moderately understates overall risk and
   strongly understates affective risk of mental health difficulties for
   women following abortion. Compared to corresponding births, abortions of
   wanted pregnancies are associated with a greater risk of negative
   psychological affect, particularly depression and suicide ideation, but
   not greater risk of substance abuse, than are abortions of unwanted
   pregnancies. Clinical, research, and policy implications are discussed
   briefly.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives In the UK, people of black ethnicity experience a
   disproportionate burden of HIV and STI. We aimed to assess the
   association of ethnicity with sexual behaviour and sexual health among
   women and heterosexual men attending genitourinary medicine (GUM)
   clinics in England.
   Methods The Attitudes to and Understanding of Risk of Acquisition of HIV
   is a cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire study of HIV
   negative people recruited from 20 GUM clinics in England, 2013-2014.
   Modified Poisson regression with robust SEs was used to calculate
   adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for the association between ethnicity
   and various sexual risk behaviours, adjusted for age, study region,
   education and relationship status.
   Results Questionnaires were completed by 1146 individuals, 676 women and
   470 heterosexual men. Ethnicity was recorded for 1131 (98.8\%)
   participants: 550 (48.6\%) black/mixed African, 168 (14.9\%) black/
   mixed Caribbean, 308 (27.2\%) white ethnic groups, 105 (9.3\%) other
   ethnicity. Compared with women from white ethnic groups, black/mixed
   African women were less likely to report condomless sex with a
   non-regular partner (aPR (95\% CI) 0.67 (0.51 to 0.88)), black/mixed
   African and black/mixed Caribbean women were less likely to report two
   or more new partners (0.42 (0.32 to 0.55) and 0.44 (0.29 to 0.65),
   respectively), and black/mixed Caribbean women were more likely to
   report an STI diagnosis (1.56 (1.00 to 2.42)). Compared with men from
   white ethnic groups, black/mixed Caribbean men were more likely to
   report an STI diagnosis (1.91 (1.20 to 3.04)), but did not report risk
   behaviours more frequently. Men and women of black/mixed Caribbean
   ethnicity remained more likely to report STI history after adjustment
   for sexual risk behaviours.
   Discussion Risk behaviours were reported less frequently by women of
   black ethnicity; however, history of STI was more prevalent among
   black/mixed Caribbean women. In black/mixed Caribbean men, higher STI
   history was not explained by ethnic variation in reported risk
   behaviours. The association between STI and black/mixed Caribbean
   ethnicity remained after adjustment for risk behaviours.}},

Title = {{FLUCTUATION SPECTROSCOPY: A NEW PROBE OF OLD STELLAR POPULATIONS}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{797}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a new method to determine the relative contributions of
   different types of stars to the integrated light of nearby early-type
   galaxies. As is well known, the surface brightness of these galaxies
   shows pixel-to-pixel fluctuations due to Poisson variations in the
   number of giant stars. Differential spectroscopy of pixels as a function
   of fluctuation strength ({''}fluctuation spectroscopy{''}) effectively
   measures the spectral variation of stars as a function of their
   luminosity, information that is otherwise difficult to obtain for
   individual stars outside of the Local Group. We apply this technique to
   the elliptical galaxy NGC 4472, using Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced
   Camera for Surveys imaging in six narrow-band ramp filters tuned to
   spectral features in the range 0.8 mu m-1.0 mu m. Pixels with +/- 5\%
   broad-band variations show differential color variations of 0.1\%-1.0\%
   in the narrow-band filters. These variations are primarily due to the
   systematic increase in TiO absorption strength with increasing
   luminosity on the upper giant branch. The data are very well reproduced
   by the same Conroy \& van Dokkum stellar population synthesis model that
   is the best fit to the integrated light, with residuals in the range
   0.03\%-0.09\%. Models with ages or metallicities that are significantly
   different from the integrated-light values do not yield good fits. We
   can also rule out several modifications to the underlying model,
   including the presence of a significant (>3\% of the light) population
   of late M giants. The current observations constitute a powerful test of
   the expected luminosities and temperatures of metal-rich giants in
   massive early-type galaxies. Studies of pixels with much larger
   (negative) fluctuations will provide unique information on main sequence
   stars and the stellar initial mass function.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic geometry relations comprise a classic way to understand
   characteristics of a river. However, environmental changes pose large
   uncertainties for the reliability of such relations. In the current
   study, on the basis of the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) formed
   through linear treatment of the deterministic power-law hydraulic
   geometry relations, a set of stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
   driven by Fractional white noise and Poisson noise are developed to
   simulate the historical dynamic probability distributions of typical
   hydraulic geometry variables such as slope, width, depth, and velocity
   with bankfull discharge variation over time in the lower Yellow River of
   China. One group of possible stochastic average behaviors within the
   next 50 years are calculated under three different design incoming

   annual average sediment discharge). In each part of the lower reaches,

   likelihood estimation (MLE) method, the model is carefully examined
   using Monte Carlo simulation as compared with the deterministic control
   models. The results of this comparison reveal the potential responses of
   hydraulic geometry characteristics to environmental disturbances, and
   the average trends mainly agree with the measurements. Comparisons among
   the three different prediction results reveal the stochastic average
   solution generally is greater than the deterministic solution. The
   results also confirm the severe negative impacts that result from the
   condition of 300 million t of incoming sediment, thus, pointing out the
   need to raise the level of river evolution alert for the lower Yellow
   River of China in the future. Moreover, with the help of the stochastic
   computation, the stream power and hydraulic width/depth ratio could be
   representative of an effective systematic measure for river dynamics.
   The proposed stochastic approach is not only important to development in
   the field of fluvial relations, but also beneficial to the practical
   design and monitoring of a river system according to specified accuracy
   requirements. (C) 2020 International Research and Training Centre on

Abstract = {{Objective To examine the impact of caesarean section on breastfeeding
   indicators-early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding
   under 6 months and children ever breastfed (at least once)-in
   sub-Saharan Africa.
   Design Secondary analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).
   Setting Thirty-three low-income and middle-income countries with a
   survey conducted between 2010 and 2017/2018.
   Participants Women aged 15-49 years with a singleton live last birth
   during the 2 years preceding the survey.
   Main outcome measures We analysed the DHS data to examine the impact of
   caesarean section on breastfeeding indicators using the modified Poisson
   regression models for each country adjusted for potential confounders.
   For each breastfeeding indicator, the within-country adjusted prevalence
   ratios (aPR) were pooled in random-effects meta-analysis.
   Results The within-country analyses showed, compared with vaginal birth,
   caesarean section was associated with aPR for early initiation of
   breastfeeding that ranged from 0.24 (95\% CI 0.17 to 0.33) in Tanzania
   to 0.89 (95\% CI 0.78 to 1.00) in South Africa. The aPR for exclusive
   breastfeeding under 6 months ranged from 0.58 (95\% CI 0.34 to 0.98) in
   Angola to 1.93 (95\% CI 0.46 to 8.10) in Cote d'Ivoire, while the aPR
   for children ever breastfed ranged from 0.91 (95\% CI 0.82 to 1.02) in
   Gabon to 1.02 (95\% CI 0.99 to 1.04) in Gambia. The meta-analysis showed
   caesarean section was associated with a 46\% lower prevalence of early
   initiation of breastfeeding (pooled aPR, 0.54 (95\% CI 0.48 to 0.60)).
   However, meta-analysis indicated little association with exclusive
   breastfeeding under 6 months (pooled aPR, 0.94 (95\% CI 0.88 to 1.01))
   and children ever breastfed (pooled aPR, 0.98 (95\% CI 0.98 to 0.99))
   among caesarean versus vaginally born children.
   Conclusions Caesarean section had a negative influence on early
   initiation of breastfeeding but showed little difference in exclusive
   breastfeeding under 6 months and children ever breastfed in sub-Saharan
   Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We aim to describe rates and risk factors of Hepatitis C
   Virus (HCV) diagnoses, follow-up HCV testing and HCV seroconversion from
   2004-2011 in a cohort of HIV-positive persons in Spain.
   Methods: CoRIS is a multicentre, open and prospective cohort recruiting
   adult HIV-positive patients naive to antiretroviral therapy. We analysed
   patients with at least one negative and one follow-up HCV serology.
   Incidence Rates (IR) were calculated and multivariate Poisson regression
   was used to estimate adjusted Rates Ratios (aIRR).
   Results: Of 2112 subjects, 53 HCV diagnoses were observed, IR=0.93/100py
   (95\% CI: 0.7-1.2). IR increased from 0.88 in 2004-05 to 1.36 in 2010-11
   (aIRR=1.55; 95\% CI: 0.37-6.55). In men who have sex with men (MSM) from
   0.76 to 1.10 (aIRR=1.45; 95\% CI: 0.31-6.82); in heterosexual (HTX)
   subjects from 1.19 to 1.28 (aIRR=1.08; 95\% CI: 0.11-10.24). HCV
   seroconversion rates decreased from 1.77 to 0.65 (aIRR=0.37; 95\% CI:
   0.12-1.11); in MSM from 1.06 to 0.49 (aIRR=0.46; 95\% CI: 0.09-2.31); in
   HTX from 2.55 to 0.59 (aIRR=0.23; 95\% CI: 0.06-0.98). HCV infection
   risk was higher for injecting drug users (IDU) compared to HTX
   (aIRR=9.63; 95\% CI: 2.9-32.2); among MSM, for subjects aged 40-50
   compared to 30 or less (IRR=3.21; 95\% CI: 1.7-6.2); and among HTX, for
   female sex (aIRR=2.35; 95\% CI: 1.03-5.34) and <200 CD4-count
   (aIRR=2.39; 95\% CI: 0.83-6.89).
   Conclusion: We report increases in HCV diagnoses rates which seem
   secondary to intensification of HCV follow-up testing but not to rises
   in HCV infection rates. HCV IR is higher in IDU. In MSM, HCV IR
   increases with age. Among HTX, HCV IR is higher in women and in subjects
   with impaired immunological situation.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To prepare for future HIV prevention trials, we conducted
   prospective cohort studies among women working in food and recreational
   facilities in northern Tanzania. We examined the prevalence and
   incidence of HIV and HSV-2, and associated risk factors.
   Methods: Women aged 18-44 years working in food and recreational
   facilities were screened to determine their eligibility for the studies.
   Between 2008-2010, HIV-negative women were enrolled and followed for 12
   months. At enrolment and 3-monthly, we collected socio-demographic and
   behavioural data, and performed clinical examinations for collection of
   biological specimens that were tested for reproductive tract infections.
   Risk factors for HIV and HSV-2 incidence were investigated using Poisson
   regression models.
   Results: We screened 2,229 and enrolled 1,378 women. The median age was
   27 years (interquartile range, IQR 22, 33), and median duration working
   at current facility was 2 years. The prevalences of HIV at screening and
   HSV-2 at enrolment were 16\% and 67\%, respectively. Attendance at the
   12-month visit was 86\%. HIV and HSV-2 incidence rates were 3.7 (95\%
   confidence interval, CI: 2.8,5.1) and 28.6 (95\% CI: 23.5,35.0)/100
   person-years, respectively. Women who were separated, divorced, or
   widowed were at increased risk of HIV (adjusted incidence rate ratio,
   aRR = 6.63; 95\% CI: 1.97,22.2) and HSV-2 (aRR = 2.00; 95\% CI:
   1.15,3.47) compared with married women. Women reporting >= 3 partners in
   the past 3 months were at higher HIV risk compared with women with 0-1
   partner (aRR = 4.75; 95\% CI: 2.10,10.8), while those who had reached
   secondary education or above were at lower risk of HSV-2 compared with
   women with incomplete primary education (aRR = 0.42; 95\% CI:
   0.22,0.82).
   Conclusions: HIV and HSV-2 rates remain substantially higher in this
   cohort than in the general population, indicating urgent need for
   effective interventions. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of
   conducting trials to test new interventions in this highly-mobile
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Background Tuberculosis (TB) disease is a common opportunistic infection
   among people living with HIV (PLHIV). WHO recommends at least 6 months
   of isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) to reduce the risk of active TB.
   It is important to monitor the six-month IPT completion since a
   suboptimal dose may not protect PLHIV from TB infection. This study
   determined the six-month IPT completion and factors associated with
   six-month IPT completion among PLHIV aged 15 years or more in Dar es
   Salaam region, Tanzania. Methods Secondary analysis of routine data from
   PLHIV attending 58 care and treatment clinics in Dar es Salaam region
   was used. PLHIV, aged 15 years and above, who screened negative for TB
   symptoms and initiated IPT from January, 2013 to June, 2017 were
   recruited. Modified Poisson regression with robust standard errors was
   used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95\% confidence interval
   (CI) for factors associated with IPT completion. Multilevel analysis was
   used to account for health facility random effects in order to estimate
   adjusted PR (APR) for factors associated with IPT six-month completion.
   Results A total of 29,382 PLHIV were initiated IPT, with 21,808 (74\%)
   female. Overall 17,092 (58\%) six-month IPT completion, increasing from
   42\% (773/1857) in year 2013 to 76\% (2929/3856) in 2017. Multilevel
   multivariable model accounting for health facilities as clusters, showed
   PLHIV who were not on ART had 46\% lower IPT completion compared to
   those were on ART (APR: 0.54: 95\%CI: 0.45-0.64). There was 37\% lower
   IPT completion among PLHIV who transferred from another clinic (APR:
   0.63: 95\% CI (0.54-0.74) compared to those who did not transfer. PLHIV
   aged 25-34 years had a 6\% lower prevalence of IPT completion as
   compared to those aged 15 to 24 years (APR:0.94 95\%CI:0.89-0.98).
   Conclusion The IPT completion rate in PLHIV increased over time, but
   there was lower IPT completion in PLHIV who transferred from other
   clinics, who were aged 25 to 34 years and those not on ART.
   Interventions to support IPT in these groups are urgently needed.}},

Title = {{The relationships between cognitive function, literacy and HIV status

Abstract = {{Introduction Although HIV prevalence is exceptionally high in South
   Africa, HIV testing rates remain below targeted guidelines. Older adults
   living with HIV are substantially more likely to remain undiagnosed than
   younger people. Cognitive function and literacy could play key roles in
   HIV status knowledge due to the decision-making processes required
   around weighing the costs and benefits of testing, navigating testing
   logistics and processing results. We aimed to assess the independent
   relationships among each of cognitive function, literacy and education
   with HIV status knowledge in a population-based sample of older adults
   living in a rural South African community with high HIV prevalence.
   Methods We analyzed data from a population-based study of 5059 men and
   women aged 40 years and older in rural South Africa (Health and Aging in
   Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH community (HAALSI)). HAALSI
   surveys, conducted between 2014 and 2015, queried self-reported
   literacy, educational attainment and HIV status knowledge. Laboratory
   tests were conducted to assess true HIV sero-status. Cognitive function
   was assessed with a battery of cognitive tests measuring time
   orientation, immediate and delayed recall, and numeracy and coded using
   confirmatory factor analysis as a z-standardized latent variable. We
   estimated the relationship between the outcome of HIV status knowledge
   and each of three exposures: (1) latent cognitive z-score, (2) literacy
   and (3) education, using confounder-adjusted modified Poisson regression
   models in the study population overall and stratified by HIV
   sero-status.
   Results We found that HIV status knowledge was higher among those with
   higher cognitive z-scores (adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR) (95\% CI):
   1.18 (1.14, 1.21) per standard deviation unit), and among literate
   participants (aPR (95\% CI): 1.24 (1.16, 1.32) vs. non-literate
   participants). Taken together, the associations with literacy and
   cognitive function completely attenuated the otherwise positive
   association between educational attainment and HIV status knowledge. The
   magnitudes of effect were generally similar among laboratory-confirmed
   HIV-negative and HIV-positive participants.
   Conclusions Campaigns that target older adults in rural South Africa
   with HIV testing messages should carefully consider the cognitive and
   literacy levels of the intended audience. Innovations to ease the
   cognitive load associated with HIV testing could prove fruitful to
   increase HIV status knowledge.}},

Title = {{Prevalence of sexual coercion and its association with unwanted

   based cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{BMC WOMENS HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Sexual coercion is associated with sexually transmitted
   infections and unwanted pregnancies with consequential unsafe abortions
   and increased maternal morbidity and mortality. Current literature
   focuses mainly on its risk factors but less on its resultant deleterious
   health effects. We conducted a study to determine the prevalence of
   sexual coercion and its association with unwanted pregnancies among
   young pregnant women.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study, four hundred and sixteen (416)
   consenting pregnant females aged 15-24 years attending antenatal clinics
   in Lubaga division Kampala district in Uganda were enrolled using
   systematic sampling. Quantitative and qualitative data on sexual
   coercion were collected by female interviewers. Adjusted Prevalence
   Proportion Ratios (Adj. PPRs) of unwanted pregnancy and associated 95 \%
   confidence intervals were estimated by generalized linear models with
   log link function and Poisson family distribution using robust variance
   estimator. Quantitative data were analyzed using Stata version 10.0,
   while qualitative data were analyzed using manifest content analysis.
   Results: Prevalence of sexual coercion was 24 \% and was higher among
   those who had non consensual sexual debut (29.0 \%) compared with those
   who had consensual sexual debut (22.6 \%). The prevalence of unwanted
   pregnancy was 18.3 \% and was higher among participants who had been
   sexually coerced relative to their counterparts (p < 0.001). History of
   sexual coercion in the past 12 months and non consensual sexual debut
   were associated with unwanted pregnancy {[}adj.PPR = 2.23, 95 \% CI:
   (1.49-3.32)] and 1.72, 95 \% CI: (1.16-2.54)] respectively. Qualitative
   results indicated that different forms/contexts of sexual coercion, such
   as deception, transactional sex and physical force influenced unwanted
   pregnancies.
   Discussion: This study highlights that a quarter of our participants in
   our quantitative study had experienced sexual coercion in the past
   twelve months and nearly a third of these, had history of non consensual
   sexual debut. Unwanted pregnancy was higher among the sexually coerced
   and those who had non consensual sexual debut.
   Conclusion: Sexual coercion among pregnant women aged 15-24 years in
   Kampala, Uganda is high and is significantly associated with unwanted
   pregnancy. Comprehensive sex education targeting young people (< 25
   years), along with availability and access to youth friendly centers may
   be useful in addressing sexual coercion and its negative outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Although the association between alcohol consumption and HIV risk is
   well documented, few studies have examined the magnitude of new HIV
   infections that could be prevented by controlling alcohol use. We report
   the population attributable fraction (PAF) of incident HIV infections
   due to alcohol consumption among the HIV high-risk population of fishing
   communities along Lake Victoria, Uganda.
   Methods
   In a community-based cohort study, 1607 HIV sero-negative participants
   aged 18-49 years were enrolled from eight fishing communities along Lake
   Victoria, Uganda. At follow up 12 months later, 1288 (80.1\%) were seen
   and interviewed. At baseline and follow-up visits, participants
   completed interviewer-administered questionnaires on alcohol
   consumption, demographics, and sexual risk behavior, and were tested for
   HIV infection. HIV incidence and adjusted incident rate ratios (adjusted
   IRRs) were estimated using Poisson regression models; the crude and
   adjusted PAFs of incident HIV infections associated with alcohol
   consumption were calculated using the Greenland and Drescher method for
   cohort studies.
   Results
   Among the 1288 participants seen at follow up, 53.5\% reported drinking
   alcohol of whom 24.4\% drank occasionally (2 days a week or less) and
   29.1\% drank regularly (3-7 days a week). Forty eight incident HIV
   infections occurred giving an incidence rate of 3.39/100 person years
   at-risk (pyar) (95\% CI, 2.55-4.49). Compared to non-drinkers, the
   adjusted IRR of HIV was 3.09 (1.13-8.46) among occasional drinkers and
   5.34 (2.04-13.97) among regular drinkers. The overall adjusted PAF of
   incident HIV infections due alcohol was 64.1 (95\% CI; 23.5-83.1);
   ranging from 52.3 (11.9-74.2) among Muslims to 71.2 (32.6-87.7) for
   participants who reported >= 2 sexual partners in the past 12 months.
   Conclusion
   In fishing communities along Lake Victoria, Uganda, 64\% of new HIV
   infections can be attributed to drinking alcohol. Interventions to
   reduce alcohol consumption should be integrated in HIV/AIDS prevention
   activities for populations in whom both HIV and alcohol consumption are
   highly prevalent.}},

   trial, we report pregnancy incidence during and after the vaccination
   period and identify factors, measured at screening, associated with
   incident pregnancy.
   Methods: To enrol in the trial, women agreed and were supported to avoid
   pregnancy until 1 month after their third and final vaccination
   ({''}vaccination period{''}), corresponding to the first 7 months of
   follow-up. Unsterilized women, pooled across study arms, were analyzed.
   Poisson regression compared pregnancy rates during and after the
   vaccination period. Cox proportional hazards regression identified
   associations with first pregnancy.
   Results: Among 352 women (median age 23 yrs; median follow-up 1.5 yrs),
   pregnancy incidence was 9.6/100 women-years overall and 6.8/100 w-yrs
   and 11.3/100 w-yrs during and after the vaccination period, respectively
   {[}Rate Ratio = 0.60 (0.32-1.14), p = 0.10]. In multivariable analysis,
   pregnancy was reduced among women who: enrolled at sites providing
   contraception on-site {[}HR = 0.43, 95\% CI (0.22-0.86)]; entered the
   trial as injectable contraceptive users {[}HR = 0.37 (0.21-0.67)] or as
   consistent condom users (trend) {[}HR = 0.54 (0.28-1.04)]. Compared with
   women with a single partner of HIV-unknown status, pregnancy rates were
   increased among women with: a single partner whose status was
   HIV-negative {[}HR = 2.34(1.16-4.73)] and; 2 partners both of
   HIV-unknown status {[}HR = 4.42(1.59-12.29)]. Women with 2 more of these
   risk factors: marijuana use, heavy drinking, or use of either during
   sex, had increased pregnancy incidence {[}HR = 2.66 (1.24-5.72)].
   Conclusions: It is possible to screen South African women for pregnancy
   risk at trial entry. Providing injectable contraception for free on-site
   and supporting consistent condom use may reduce incident pregnancy.
   Screening should determine the substance use, partnering, and HIV status
   of both members of the couple for both pregnancy and HIV prevention.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Introduction. The elderly population is growing fast worldwide, and
   therefore, investigation of health outcomes peculiar to these
   individuals is a public health priority nowadays. The decade between
   2000 and 2010 is denominated as the Bone and Joint Decade, and
   researchers are encouraged to quantity the burden of musculo-skeletal
   disorders worldwide. This is particularly relevant to developing
   countries. where the burden of these diseases is not well known. This
   Study aims to evaluate the prevalence of fractures (lifetime and
   previous year) and its association with socio-demographic variables and
   medical diagnosis of osteoporosis.
   Materials and methods. Population-based cross-sectional study including
   a multiple-stage sample of individuals aged 20 years or more living in
   Pelotas. a southern Brazilian city. Both the lifetime prevalence of
   fractures and the proportion of fractures in the year prior to the
   interview were investigated. Sex, age, skin color, socioeconomic level,
   schooling level and medical diagnosis of osteoporosis were used as
   independent variables. After descriptive and crude analyses, a Poisson
   regression was carried Out in order to provide prevalence ratios
   including adjustment for confounding.
   Results. The lifetime prevalence of fractures was 28.3\%, and 2.3\% of
   the individuals broke a bone in the year prior to the interview. Among
   men, most fractures were Caused by sports practice and happened in
   leisure-time outside home. Among women, most fractures occurred inside
   home and were caused by falls. The lifetime prevalence of fractures was
   positively associated with male sex and white or mixed skin color. The
   prevalence of fractures in the year prior to the inter-view was greater
   among poor individuals and those with a medical diagnosis of
   osteoporosis. Among all fractures happened in older adults (60 years or
   more) in the 12 months prior to the interview, 83.3\% were caused by
   falls.
   Conclusions. Data of this investigation might help policy makers to
   reduce the burden of fractures, particularly among women and older
   adults, by stimulating prevention against household falls and
   osteoporosis. Special attention should be given to the poorest
   individuals, who have a greater likelihood of developing several
   negative health outcomes and presented a higher risk of fractures in the
   present study. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two kinds of innovative re-entrant and hexagonal cell honeycomb sandwich
   structures filled with reactive powder concrete were proposed, and the
   ballistic resistance and energy absorption of the sandwich structures
   were investigated by numerical simulations. The deformation and failure
   modes of the different structures were analyzed and evaluated in detail.
   The honeycomb sandwich structures filled with reactive powder concrete
   prisms improved the capacity of ballistic resistance and energy
   absorption significantly, compared to the normal reactive powder
   concrete plates and sandwich structures without reactive powder concrete
   prisms. The analysis shows that the auxetic re-entrant cell honeycomb
   sandwich structures have a better ballistic performance than the
   hexagonal cell honeycomb sandwich structures. The sandwich structures
   were subjected to impact by three kinds of projectiles: flat,
   hemispherical and conical nosed. The ballistic limit of the flat nosed
   projectile is the highest, while the impact performance of the conical
   and hemispherical nosed projectiles is obviously different from the flat
   nosed projectile, especially in a relative high velocity range. The
   sharper nose leads to a higher value of exit velocity and mass loss. In
   addition, effects of different design parameters on ballistic resistance
   were also studied by changing the thickness of honeycomb cell and face
   plates. Results indicate that the thickness of honeycomb walls and face
   plates have significant effect on the ballistic resistance and energy
   absorption in a relative low velocity range, while there are no big
   differences when the initial impact velocity exceeds 400m/s.}},

Title = {{Determinants and outcomes of access-related blood-stream infections
   among Irish haemodialysis patients; a cohort study}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundInfections are the second leading cause of death and
   hospitalisation among haemodialysis (HD) patients. Rates of
   access-related bloodstream infections (AR-BSI) are influenced by patient
   characteristics and local protocols. We explored factors associated with
   AR-BSI in a contemporary cohort of HD patients at a tertiary nephrology
   centre.MethodsA retrospective cohort of 235 chronic HD patients was
   identified from a regional dialysis programme between Jan 2015 and Dec
   2016. Data on demographics, primary renal disease, comorbid conditions
   and dialysis access type were obtained from the Kidney Disease Clinical
   Patient Management System (KDCPMS). Data on blood cultures were captured
   from the microbiology laboratory. Poisson regression with robust
   variance estimates was used to compare infection rates and relative risk
   of AR-BSI according to the site and type of vascular access.ResultsThe
   mean age was 65 ( 15) years, 77\% were men, and the median follow up was
   19months (IQR: 10-24months), accumulating 2030 catheter-months and 1831
   fistula-months. Overall rates of AR-BSI were significantly higher for
   central venous catheter (CVC) compared to arteriovenous fistula (AVF),
   (2.22, 95\% (CI): 1.62-2.97) versus 0.11 (0.01-0.39) per 100
   patient-months respectively), with a rate ratio of 20.29 (4.92-83.66),
   p<0.0001. This pattern persisted across age, gender and diabetes
   subgroups. Within the CVC subgroup, presence of a femoral CVC access was
   associated with significantly higher rates of AR-BSI (adjusted RR 4.93,
   95\% CI: 2.69-9.01). Older age (75+ versus <75years) was not associated
   with significant differences in rates of AR-BSI in the unadjusted or the
   adjusted analysis. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (61\%) and
   Staphylococcus aureus (23\%) were the predominant culprits. AR-BSIs
   resulted in access loss and hospitalisation in 57 and 72\% of events
   respectively, and two patients died with concurrent AR-BSI.Conclusions
   Rates of AR-BSI are substantially higher in CVC than AVF in contemporary
   HD despite advances in catheter design and anti-infective protocols.
   This pattern was consistent in all subgroups. The policy of AVF
   preference over CVC should continue to minimise patient morbidity while
   at the same time improving anti-infective strategies through better care
   protocols and infection surveillance.}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) programmes have been
   initiated in sub-Saharan Africa to prevent HIV acquisition in key
   populations at increased risk. However, data on PrEP uptake and
   retention in high-risk African communities are limited. We evaluated
   PrEP uptake and retention in HIV hyperendemic fishing villages and
   trading centres in south-central Uganda between April 2018 and March
   2019.
   MethodsPrEP eligibility was assessed using a national risk screening
   tool. Programme data were used to evaluate uptake and retention over 12
   months. Multivariable modified Poisson regression estimated adjusted
   prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95\% Confidence intervals (CIs) of uptake
   associated with covariates. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate
   retention and multivariable Cox regression to estimate adjusted relative
   hazards (aRH) and 95\% CIs of discontinuation associated with
   covariates.
   Results and discussionOf the 2985 HIV-negative individuals screened;
   2750 (92.1 \%) were eligible; of whom 2,536 (92.2\%) accepted PrEP. Male
   (aPR = 0.91, 95\% CI = 0.85 to 0.97) and female (aPR = 0.85, 95\% CI =
   0.77 to 0.94) fisher folk were less likely to accept compared to
   HIV-discordant couples. Median retention was 45.4 days for both men and
   women, whereas retention was higher among women (log rank, p < 0.001)
   overall. PrEP discontinuation was higher among female sex workers (aRH =
   1.42, 95\% CI = 1.09 to 1.83) and female fisher folk (aRH = 1.99, 95\%
   CI = 1.46 to 2.72), compared to women in discordant couples. Male fisher
   folk (aRH = 1.37, 95\% CI = 1.07 to 1.76) and male truck drivers (aRH =
   1.49, 95\% CI = 1.14 to 1.94) were more likely to discontinue compared
   to men in discordant couples. Women 30 to 34 years tended to have lower
   discontinuation rates compared to adolescents 15 to 19 years (RH = 0.78
   {[}95\% CI = 0.63 to 0.96]).
   ConclusionsPrEP uptake was high, but retention was very low especially
   among those at the highest risk of HIV: fisher folk, sex workers and
   truck drivers and adolescent girls. Research on reasons for PrEP
   discontinuation could help optimize retention.}},

Title = {{The perception of Italian pregnant women and new mothers about their

Abstract = {{BackgroundIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, drastic measures for
   social distancing have been introduced also in Italy, likely with a
   substantial impact in delicate conditions like pregnancy and puerperium.
   The study aimed to investigate the changes in lifestyle, access to
   health services, and mental wellbeing during the first Italian lockdown
   in a sample of Italian pregnant women and new mothers.MethodsWe carried
   out a web-based survey to evaluate how pregnant women and new mothers
   were coping with the lockdown. We collected data about healthy habits
   (physical exercise and dietary habits), access to health services (care
   access, delivery and obstetric care, neonatal care, and breastfeeding),
   and mental wellbeing (psychological well-being and emotive support).
   Descriptive analysis was performed for both groups of participants,
   whereas a Poisson analysis was used to measure the association between
   some structural variables (age, education, socio-economic data, partner
   support, contact, free time, previous children, and pregnancy trimester)
   and anxiety or depression, difficulties in healthy eating and reduction
   in physical activity after lockdown started. Chi2 and Adjusted
   Prevalence Ratios were estimated only for pregnant women.ResultsWe
   included 739 respondents (response rate 85.8\%), 600 were pregnant
   (81.2\%), and 139 (18.8\%) had delivered during lockdown (new mothers).
   We found a high score for anxiety and depression in 62.8\% of pregnant
   women and 61.9\% of new mothers. During the lockdown, 61.8\% of pregnant
   women reduced their physical exercise, and 44.3\% reported eating in a
   healthier way. 94.0\% of new mothers reported to have breastfed their
   babies during the hospital stay. Regarding the perceived impact of
   restrictive measures on breastfeeding, no impact was reported by 56.1\%
   of new mothers, whereas a negative one by 36.7\%.ConclusionsThe high
   prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in pregnant women and new
   mothers should be a public health issue. Clinicians might also recommend
   and encourage ``home{''} physical exercise. On the other hand, about
   half of the sample improved their approach towards healthy eating and a
   very high breastfeeding rate was reported soon after birth: these data
   are an interesting starting point to develop new strategies for public
   health.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cooling may reduce infarct size and improve neurological
   outcomes in patients with ischaemic stroke. In phase II trials, cooling
   awake patients with ischaemic stroke has been shown to be feasible and
   safe, but the effects in functional outcomes has not yet been
   investigated in an adequately sized randomised clinical trial.
   Methods/design: The EuroHYP-1 trial is a multinational, randomised,
   superiority phase III clinical trial with masked outcome assessment
   testing the benefits and harms of therapeutic cooling in awake adult
   patients with acute ischaemic stroke. The outcomes dealt with here
   include the primary outcome the Rankin score (mRS) at day 91 +/-14 days
   after randomisation. The secondary and exploratory outcomes at day 91
   +/-14 days unless otherwise stated encompassing: (1) death or
   dependency, defined as mRS score > 2; (2) death; (3) National Institutes
   of Health Stroke Score; (4) brain infarct size at 48 +/-24 hours; (5)
   EQ-5D-5 L score, and (6) WHODAS 2.0 score. Other outcomes are: the
   primary safety outcome serious adverse events; and the incremental
   cost-effectiveness, and cost utility ratios. The analysis sets include
   (1) the intention-to-treat population, and (2) the per protocol
   population. The sample size is estimated to 800 patients (5\% type 1 and
   20\% type 2 errors). All analyses are adjusted for the
   protocol-specified stratification variables (nationality of centre), and
   the minimisation variables. In the analysis, we use ordinal regression
   (the primary outcome), logistic regression (binary outcomes), general
   linear model (continuous outcomes), and the Poisson or negative binomial
   model (rate outcomes).
   Discussion: Major adjustments compared with the original statistical
   analysis plan encompass: (1) adjustment of analyses by nationality; (2)
   power calculations for the secondary outcomes; (3) to address the
   multiplicity problem using of a fixed-sequence testing procedure
   starting with the primary outcome followed by the secondary outcomes
   ordered according to falling power; (4) assignment of worst possible
   score to patients who are not alive at the planned date of measurement
   of the continuous scores; (5) improved imputations; (6) outline of a
   supplementary exploratory analysis of the temperature measurements and
   time to death; and (7) substantial reduction of sample size.}},

Abstract = {{21 well-distributed teleseisms (30 degrees to 100 degrees distance) were
   recorded by mixed broad-band (BB) and short-period (SP) seismic arrays
   at Mineral King (MK) and Horseshoe Meadow (HM) in the southern Sierra
   Nevada and at Darwin Plateau (DP) between the Inyo and Argus ranges.
   These arrays permit identification and separation of direct P and S
   arrivals, reflections from topography, scattered energy, and arrivals
   from different back azimuths (multipath arrivals). P-to-S conversions
   can be identified from beamed BE or SP seismograms. Least squares time
   domain processing recovered single-event receiver functions from these
   beamed seismograms. Converted phases attributable to the Moho are clear
   and uncomplicated at DP; Ps-P times of 3.9-4.2 s correspond to crustal
   thicknesses of 31-33 km, assuming a mean P crustal velocity of 6.2 km/s
   and a Poisson's ratio (v) of 0.255. Ps-P times at HM (eastern Sierra)
   are 3.9-4.6 s (32-37 km) excepting some unusual seismograms from events
   at back azimuths of 225 degrees-239 degrees. MK (western Sierra) times
   for Ps-P show a strong E-W asymmetry: 3.9-4.1 s (31-33 km) from the
   east, and 4.8-5.3 s (39-42 km) from the west. The MK arrivals from the
   east are multiple and substantially weaker by comparison with HM and DP.
   These results confirm the absence of a thick crust under the southern
   High Sierra inferred from both a refraction experiment coincident with
   this experiment and some earlier studies. At DP the Moho event follows
   an intracrustal negative polarity event defining the top of an S wave
   low-velocity zone. This feature dips west under the Sierran crest at HM
   but is absent farther west at MK. This feature appears to be a
   manifestation of extensional strain and thus indicates that the
   surficially undeformed Sierra overlies a tectonized lower crust.
   Sub-Moho energy is absent under the Basin and Range (DP) but is
   conspicuous under the High Sierra at positive arrivals similar to 7.3 s
   (MK) and similar to 9 s (HM) after the P. These arrivals might be from
   the base of a low-velocity, low-density upper mantle body supporting the
   Sierra.}},

Abstract = {{Background Anemia in women of reproductive age is a major public health
   challenge for low- and middle-income countries with a long-term negative
   impact on the health of women, their children, and the economic growth
   of the society. Even though the world health organization targeted a
   50\% global reduction of anemia among women of reproductive age by 2025,
   with the current trend it is unlikely to achieve this goal. Objective
   This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of
   anemia among women of reproductive age in eastern Africa. Methods A
   secondary data analysis, using demographic and health survey (DHS) data
   of 10 eastern African countries, was conducted. For our study, a total
   weighted sample of 101524 women of reproductive age was used. We
   employed a multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear model (using
   Poisson regression with robust error variance). Both unadjusted and
   adjusted prevalence ratios with their 95\% confidence interval were
   reported. Results The prevalence of anemia in eastern Africa was 34.85
   (95\%CI: 34.56-35.14) ranging from 19.23\% in Rwanda to 53.98\% in
   Mozambique. In the multivariable multilevel analysis, being older age,
   having primary and above education, being from households with second to
   highest wealth quantiles, being currently working, not perceiving
   distance as a big problem, use of modern contraceptive methods, and
   rural residence was associated with a lower prevalence of anemia. While,
   being married and divorced/separated/widowed, women from female-headed
   households, women from households with unimproved toilet facility and
   unimproved water source, ever had of a terminated pregnancy, having high
   parity, and being from large household size was associated with a higher
   prevalence of anemia. Conclusion The prevalence of anemia in eastern
   Africa was relatively high. Both individual level and community level
   factors were associated with the prevalence of anemia in women of
   reproductive age. Therefore, giving special attention to those women who
   are at a higher prevalence of anemia such as younger women, those who
   are from households with low socioeconomic status, unimproved toilet
   facility, and source of drinking water, as well as pregnant women could
   decrease anemia in women of reproductive age.}},

Abstract = {{Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes a fast-spreading, highly contagious
   infectious disease in several bird species. Commercial poultry farms in
   Brazil were considered free of virulent NDV. Data on NDV infection
   levels in backyard poultry flocks and the epidemiology of the disease
   are limited. The aim of this study was to perform a NDV survey in
   backyard poultry from households flocks located around one of the main
   wintering sites for migratory wild birds in Brazil, and to identify
   potential risk factors associated with NDV. Backyard poultry may be
   sentinels and a source of infection for commercial poultry, since they
   may have as much contact with these birds as with migratory wild birds.
   Data were collected from 48 randomly selected households using an
   epidemiological questionnaire. Serum samples from poultry were tested
   for NDV antibodies using an ELISA, and tracheal and cloacal swabs were
   collected for NDV molecular detection. The risk factors were assessed
   using a multivariate Poisson regression with robust variance. The ELISA
   showed that 33.8\% of the serum samples were positive for anti-NDV
   antibodies and in 42 households (87.5\%) at least one NDV-positive bird
   was found. Tracheal and cloacal swabs were negative for NDV by real time
   RT-PCR, possible because within this region there might flow a low
   pathogenicity NDV strain, which can induce seroconversion with
   innaparent clinical findings. The prevalence ratio (PR) increased when
   farmers used their own replacement poultry to restock their flock (PR =
   1.64; 95\% CI: 1.11-2.42). Furthermore, the increasing distance of the
   household flock from the ``Laguna do Peixe{''} estuary was associated
   with decreasing NDV seropositivity (PR = 0.94; 95\% CI: 0.90-0.99). This
   is the first study in Brazil evaluating the presence of NDV and the
   associated risk factors in households with backyard poultry flocks. The
   great number of farms with seropositive birds indicates that the virus
   circulates in backyard flocks, and this breeding system may be a source
   of NDV. These data can be used to establish appropriate biosecurity and
   husbandry measures for this type of breeding system to prevent NDV
   spread in Brazil. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Comparison group (diarrhea patients negative for TS) was randomly
   selected from the database (1:3 ratio). Two poisson regression models
   were investigated for modelling seasonal effects on the number of cases.
   Results: Salmonella Typhi was more frequently isolated in Dhaka than
   Matlab (57\% vs. 5\%, p < 0.001); while Salmonella Paratyphi was more
   frequent in Matlab than Dhaka (96\% vs. 43\%; p < 0.001). Fever {[}adj.
   OR-5.86 (95\% CI: 2.16, 15.94)], antimicrobial use at home {[}5.08
   (2.60, 9.90)], and fecal red blood cells {[}2.53 (1.38, 4.64)] were
   significantly associated with detection of TS in stool of patient from
   Dhaka. For Matlab, the correlates were, vomiting {[}1.88 (1.35, 2.64)],
   fecal macrophage {[}1.89 (1.29, 2.74)] in addition to fever and duration
   of diarrhea and antimicrobial use. At Dhaka, all Salmonella Typhi
   isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone; while in Dhaka and Matlab
   however, for ciprofloxacin it was 45\% and 91\%, respectively.
   Susceptibility to chloramphenicol, ampicillin,
   trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and nalidixic acid ranged from 12\%-58\%.
   Salmonella Paratyphi were susceptible to ceftriaxone (99\%). A
   significant seasonal trend and year difference (before and after 2007)
   for Matlab was observed (p < 0.001 for all effects). Dhaka does not show
   significant year or seasonal effects (p = 0.07 for years and p = 0.81
   and p = 0.18 for the cos and sin components, respectively). While not
   significant, two seasonal peaks were observed in Dhaka (January-February
   and September-November); while a single peak (August-November) was
   observed in Matlab.
   Conclusions: Proportion of serovar distribution of TS and their clinical
   characteristics, antimicrobial susceptibility and seasonal pattern were
   different among diarrhea patients in urban Dhaka and rural Matlab of
   Bangladesh.}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric foams are used for impact protection due to their ability to
   absorb large amounts of strain energy. In this work, the compressive
   response of an open cell polyurethane foam currently used as liner in
   the advanced combat helmet is examined across strain rates. A
   traditional load frame is used to investigate the quasi-static behavior,
   and two different modifications of a conventional Kolsky
   (split-Hopkinson) bar configuration are used to probe the dynamic
   response. A unique, independent method not relying on strain gage
   signals is presented that leverages high-speed full-field imaging to
   track the velocity on each side of the sample-bar interface and used to
   extract the dynamic stress-strain response; the results are compared
   against traditional strain gage measurements. X-ray tomography is used
   to examine the global morphological characteristics of the foam. The
   foam is found to be strongly rate dependent, where the characteristic
   properties vary logarithmically with strain rate. An analytical
   expression is presented to describe the rate dependency that collapses
   all stress-strain curves on a master curve. Full-field kinematic data
   from digital image correlation taken during loading is used to extract a
   nonlinear Poisson's ratio as a function of strain, which is found to be
   strain rate insensitive. A tangent Poisson function is used to explore
   the foam's auxetic behavior. These findings provide insight on
   physically-based constitutive modeling of foams, crucial to predictive
   brain injury simulations, as well as motivate the need to probe local
   heterogenous behavior across strain rates moving forward.}},

Title = {{Effects of tablet waviness on the mechanical response of architected
   multilayered materials: Modeling and experiment}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{195}},

Abstract = {{The excellent mechanical properties that biological materials possess
   are greatly influenced by the geometrical properties of their small
   scale constituents. Nacre, also known as Mother of Pearl, is an
   organic-inorganic composite material that makes up the inner layer of
   seashells. Nacre is observed for its impressive combination of
   stiffness, strength, and toughness which can be attributed to its
   waviness and the layering pattern of the brick and mortar structure of
   ceramic and protein that allows nacre to exhibit great mechanical energy
   and dissipate it over a large volume. In this study, the effect of this
   waviness on a model architected multilayered material system is analyzed
   numerically and experimentally in order to understand its effects on the
   stiffness, strength, and toughness of nacre. 3-D printed composites with
   auxetic and nacreous structure were created and tested in tensile
   boundary conditions. Finite element analysis was used to study the
   stress distribution and mechanical response of these composites. Results
   from the finite element models and the mechanical tests results show
   that increasing the tablet's waviness increases the stiffness, however,
   there is an optimum value of tablet waviness for the highest strength
   and tensile toughness. Increasing waviness level can improve the elastic
   modulus by about 23\%, strength by about 65\% and toughness by about
   42\%. Using the proposed modeling approach, more detailed studies can be
   done on the toughening mechanisms of composite multilayered materials.
   These results can be used as a guide to design super-tough composites
   with multilayered structures.}},

Abstract = {{An epidemiological cohort study of Cryptosporidium scophthalmi in
   cultured turbot Psetta maxima L of Northwestern Spain was conducted
   along a four-year period. Four different ongrowing cohorts were
   monitored monthly from introduction into the ongrowing tanks (10-50 g)
   until reaching market size (400-1400 g). The association of host and
   environmental factors with five categories of parasite abundance was
   assessed using a multivariable regression framework. Epidemiological
   factors assessed here were water temperature. weight, length, month of
   collection, season, age, origin, condition factor, water filtration. and
   status to the myxozoan Enteromyxum scophthalmi infection. E scophthalmi
   was included into the analysis because it targets the same organ than C
   scophthalmi and it was prevalent in the studied population The
   multivariable analysis demonstrated the statistically significant
   association between several factors and parasite abundance. C.
   scophthalmi abundance was associated (P < 0.05) with age, condition
   factor, season, and status to E scophthalmi infection. Young animals.
   with poor condition factor, during spring or summer. and not infected
   with the myxozoan were most likely to be highly infected by C
   scophthalmi. Inclusion of these four variables significantly (P < 0.05)
   improved the model, compared to the model that did not include any of
   these epidemiological factors. Increasing levels of C scophthalmi
   abundance were associated (P < 0.01) with higher severity of C
   scophthalmi-compatible lesions. The frequency of distribution of C
   scophthalmi abundance was clearly right-skewed and fitted a negative
   binomial distribution, whereas the intensity of infection fitted a
   Poisson distribution. The quantification of the variance-to-mean ratio
   stratified by age demonstrated over-dispersion for 8-16 months old fish,
   although this bivariate association is likely affected by several other
   factors, as suggested by the results of the multivariable analysis. The
   negative relation between C scophthalmi abundance and status to E
   scophthalmi infection suggests differences in the transmission. onset.
   and course of both infections The coarse filtration used in some cohorts
   did not significantly affect the levels of infection. C scophthalmi was
   probably introduced into the ongrowing tanks mainly with carrier fish,
   though the involvement of infective oocysts from the water supply cannot
   be disregarded. Infection prevalence and mean intensity decreased with
   fish age and a seasonal distribution was found. Results presented here
   will help to understand the epidemiology of C scophthalmi in turbot, to
   estimate the expected levels of infection associated with presence or
   absence of epidemiological factors, and to quantify the impact that the
   disease may have on susceptible turbot populations. The multivariable
   model used here is more powerful than the visual inspection of graphics
   for exploring associations in cooperative processes and can be easily
   extended to the assessment of epidemiological associations in other
   population and parasitic diseases. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Relative age effect and second-tiers: No second chance for later-born
   players}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{The main objective of this research was to determine the existence of
   relative age effect (RAE) in five European soccer leagues and their
   second-tier competitions. Even though RAE is a well-known phenomenon in
   professional sports environments it seems that the effect does not
   decline over the years. Moreover, additional information is required,
   especially when taking into account second-tier leagues. Birthdates from
   1,332 first-tier domestic players from France, England, Spain, Germany
   and Italy and birthdates from 1,992 second-tier domestic players for the
   2014/2015 season were taken for statistical analysis. In addition to
   standard statistical tests, the data were analyzed using econometric
   techniques for count data using Poisson and negative binomial
   regressions. The results obtained confirmed a biased distribution of
   birthdates in favor of players born earlier in the calendar year. For
   all of the five first-tier soccer leagues there was an unequal
   distribution of birthdates (France chi(2) = 40.976, P<0.001; England
   chi(2) = 21.892, P = 0.025; Spain chi(2) = 24.690, P = 0.010; Germany
   chi(2) = 22.889, P = 0.018; Italy chi(2) = 28.583, P = 0.003). The
   results for second-tier leagues were similar (France chi(2) = 46.741,
   P<0.001; England chi(2) = 27.301, P = 0.004; Spain chi(2) = 49.745,
   P<0.001; Germany chi(2) = 30.633, P = 0.001; Italy chi(2) = 36.973,
   P<0.001). Econometric techniques achieved similar results: estimated
   effect of month of birth, i.e., long-term RAE on players'
   representativeness, is negative (statistically significant at the 1\%
   level). On average, one month closer to the end of the year reduces the
   logs of expected counts of players by 6.9\%. Assuming this effect as
   linear, being born in the month immediately before the cut-off date
   (i.e., December/August), reduces the logs of expected counts of players
   by approximately 75.9\%. Further, ID (index of discrimination, that is,
   the ratio between the expected counts of players born in the middle of
   the first and the twelfth month of the selection year) is 2.13 and 2.22
   for the first-and second-tier, respectively. In other words, in the top
   five European first-tier and second-tier leagues, one should expect the
   number of players born in the first month of the calendar year to be
   twice the number of those born in the last month. The RAE in the
   second-tiers is the same as in the first-tiers, so it appears that there
   is no second chance for later born players. This reduces the chances to
   recover talented players discarded in youth simply because of lower
   maturity.}},

Title = {{A microstructure-based model for time-dependent mechanics of
   multi-layered soft tissues and its application to intervertebral disc
   annulus}},

Abstract = {{In recent experimental studies an unusual time-dependent transversal
   behavior of the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc mainly
   caused by the coupling between mechanics and electro-chemical activity
   was disclosed. In this contribution, a microstructure-based model is
   proposed to connect structural features, intrinsic mechanics and
   electro-chemical properties of multi-layered soft tissues with a special
   attention to disc annulus. A hybrid experimental/modeling decoupling
   strategy is proposed to obtain the constitutive representation of each
   layer of the disc annulus thanks to full-field strain data. The layers
   are then reconnected to each other to get the overall time-dependent
   response considering inter-layer ionic diffusion as well as
   stress/strain continuity along the interfaces. The final constitutive
   model is shown to describe the experimentally observed behavior of
   bovine tissues under free swelling immediately followed by quasi-static
   stretching, deviating from chemical equilibrium and provoking
   auxeticity, and then relaxation, allowing equilibrium return. The
   model/experiments comparison demonstrates that the evaluation of the
   overall time-dependent response involves considering stress, volumetric
   change and auxetic feature simultaneously in relation to
   diffusion-mechanics and structural features in terms of collagen
   orientation/content, interlamellar matrix inter-spacing fiber-reinforced
   layers and gradual thickness of layers. The effective contribution of
   fiber-reinforced and unreinforced interlamellar layers on the coupling
   is discussed with respect to the model. Using the model, microstructure
   and coupling effects are independently investigated in order to
   highlight their role on the damage-related annulus shearing.}},

   mesh}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Often wetting is considered from the perspective of a single surface of
   a rigid substrate and its topographical properties such as roughness or
   texture. However, many substrates, such as membranes and meshes, have
   two useful surfaces. Such flexible substrates also offer the potential
   to be formed into structures with either a double-sided surface (e.g. by
   joining the ends of a mesh as a tape) or a single-sided surface (e.g. by
   ends with a half-twist). When a substrate possesses holes, it is also
   possible to consider how the spaces in the substrate may be connected or
   disconnected. This combination of flexibility, holes and connectedness
   can therefore be used to introduce topological concepts, which are
   distinct from simple topography. Here, we present a method to create a
   Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surface (SLIPS) coating on flexible
   conformable doubled-sided meshes and for coating complex geometries. By
   considering the flexibility and connectedness of a mesh with the surface
   properties of SLIPS, we show it is possible to create double-sided SLIPS
   materials with high droplet mobility and droplet control on both faces.
   We also exemplify the importance of flexibility using a mesh-based SLIPS
   pipe capable of withstanding laminar and turbulent flows for 180 and 90
   minutes, respectively. Finally, we discuss how ideas of topology
   introduced by the SLIPS mesh might be extended to create completely new
   types of SLIPS systems, such as Mobius strips and auxetic metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper deals with the implementation of an optimization
   algorithm for periodic problems which alternates shape and topology
   optimization; the theoretical background about shape and topological
   derivatives was developed in Part I (Barbarosie and Toader, Struct
   Multidiscipl Optim, 2009). The proposed numerical code relies on a
   special implementation of the periodicity conditions based on
   differential geometry concepts: periodic functions are viewed as
   functions defined on a torus. Moreover the notion of periodicity is
   extended and cases where the periodicity cell is a general parallelogram
   are admissible. This approach can be adapted to other frameworks (e.g.
   Bloch waves or fluid dynamics). The numerical method was tested for the
   design of periodic microstructures. Several examples of optimal
   microstructures are given for bulk modulus maximization, maximization of
   rigidity for shear response, maximization of rigidity in a prescribed
   direction, minimization of the Poisson coefficient.}},

Title = {{Gender-Specific Determinants and Patterns of Online Health Information
   Seeking: Results From a Representative German Health Survey}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Online health information-seeking behavior (OHISB) is
   currently a widespread and common behavior that has been described as an
   important prerequisite of empowerment and health literacy. Although
   demographic factors such as socioeconomic status (SES), age, and gender
   have been identified as important determinants of OHISB, research is
   limited regarding the gender-specific motivational determinants of OHISB
   and differences between women and men in the use of online resources for
   health information purposes.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to identify gender-specific
   determinants and patterns of OHISB by analyzing data from a
   representative German sample of adults (N=1728) with special attention
   to access and frequency of use as well as topics and sources of OHISB.
   Methods: We employed a 2-step analysis, that is, after exploring
   differences between users and nonusers of online health information
   using logistic regression models, we highlighted gender-specific
   determinants of the frequency of OHISB by applying zero-truncated
   negative binomial models.
   Results: Age (odds ratio, OR for females=0.97, 95\% CI 0.96-0.99) and
   degree of satisfaction with one's general practitioner (GP) (OR for
   males=0.73, 95\% CI 0.57-0.92) were gender-specific determinants of
   access to OHISB. Regarding the frequency of OHISB, daily Internet use
   (incidence rate ratio, IRR=1.67, 95\% CI 1.19-2.33) and a strong
   interest in health topics (IRR=1.45, 95\% CI 1.19-1.77) were revealed to
   be more important predictors than SES (IRR for high SES=1.25, 95\% CI
   0.91-1.73).
   Conclusions: Users indicate that the Internet seems to be capable of
   providing a valuable source of informational support and patient
   empowerment. Increasing the potential value of the Internet as a source
   for health literacy and patient empowerment requires need-oriented and
   gender-specific health communication efforts, media, and information
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{A self-developed rotary multi-cutter device cuts stainless steel wire
   ropes into segments to fabricate twisted wires. Stainless steel porous
   twisted wire materials (PTWMs) with a spatial composite intertexture
   structure are produced by the compaction and subsequent vacuum
   solid-phase sintering of twisted wires. The stainless steel PTWMs show
   two types of typical uniaxial tensile failure modes, i.e., a 45 degrees
   angle fracture mode and an auxetic failure mode (the PTWMs expand along
   the direction perpendicular to the tension). The effects of the
   sintering parameters, porosities, wire diameters, and sampling direction
   on the tensile properties of the PTWMs are carefully investigated. By
   increasing the sintering temperature from 1130 degrees C to 1330 degrees
   C, the tensile strength of the PTWMs with 70\% target porosity increased
   from 7.7 MPa to 28.6 MPa and the total failure goes down to 50\%. When
   increasing the sintering time from 90 min to 150 min, the tensile
   strength increases from 12.4 MPa to 19.1 MPa and the total failure
   elongation drops to 78.6\%. The tensile strength of the PTWMs increases
   from 28.9 MPa to 112.7 MPa with decreasing porosity from 69.5\% to
   46.0\%, and the total failure elongation also increases from 14.8\% to
   40.7\%. The tensile strength and the failure strain of the PTWMs with
   fine wires are higher than those of the PTWMs with coarse wires under
   the same porosity. Sampling direction has a small influence on the
   tensile properties of the PTWMs.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale In aging HIV-infected populations comorbid diseases are
   important determinants of morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary diseases
   have not been systematically assessed in the combination antiretroviral
   therapy (ART) era.
   Objectives: To determine the incidence of pulmonary diseases in
   HIV-infected persons compared with HIV-uninfected persons.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study Virtual
   Cohort, consisting of 33,420 HIV-infected veterans and 66,840 age, sex,
   race and ethnicity, and site-matched HIV-uninfected veterans. Using
   Poisson regression, incidence rates and adjusted incidence rate ratios
   were calculated to determine the association of HIV with pulmonary
   disease. The Virtual Cohort was merged with the 1999 Veterans Large
   Health Survey to adjust for self-reported smoking in a nested sample
   (14\%).
   Measurements and Main Results: Incident chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease, lung cancer, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary fibrosis, as
   well as pulmonary infections, were significantly more likely among
   HIV-infected patients compared with uninfected patients in adjusted
   analyses, although rates of asthma did not differ by HIV status.
   Bacterial pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the
   two most common incident pulmonary diseases, whereas opportunistic
   pneumonias were less common. Absolute rates of most pulmonary diseases
   increased with age, although the relative differences between those with
   and without HIV infection were greatest in younger persons. Chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, as well as pulmonary
   infections, were less likely in those with lower HIV RNA levels and use
   of ART at baseline.
   Conclusions: Pulmonary diseases among HIV-infected patients receiving
   care within the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System in the combination
   ART era reflect a substantial burden of non AIDS-defining and chronic
   conditions, many of which are associated with aging.}},

Title = {{Changes in Use of Respiratory Support for Preterm Infants in the US,
   2008-2018}},
Journal = {{JAMA PEDIATRICS}},
Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE In preterm infants, mechanical ventilation (MV) is associated
   with adverse pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Multiple
   randomized clinical trials over the past 2 decades have shown the
   effectiveness of early noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in decreasing the
   use of MV in preterm infants. The epidemiologic factors associated with
   respiratory support in US preterm infants and any temporal changes after
   these trials is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate temporal changes in MV and noninvasive respiratory
   support in US preterm infants.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a cohort design, 2 large national
   data sets (Pediatrix Clinical Data Warehouse for the clinical cohort and
   National Inpatient Sample for the national cohort) were used to collect
   data on preterm infants (<35 weeks' gestation) without congenital
   anomalies who received active intensive care and were discharged home or
   died in the birth hospital from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018.
   Data analysis was conducted from December 10, 2019, to December 16,
   2020.
   EXPOSURE Discharge year.
   MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES In the clinical cohort, detailed respiratory
   support data were generated, including days of MV and NIV modalities,
   and temporal trends were evaluated using multivariable modified Poisson
   or negative binomial regression models with discharge year as a
   continuous variable. In the national cohort, observed and expected
   national MV use were calculated.
   RESULTS Among 259 311 infants (47.2\% female) in 359 neonatal intensive
   care units in the clinical cohort, decreases were noted in the use (from
   29.4\% of infants in 2008 to 18.5\% in 2018, relative risk for annual
   change, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.95-0.96) and duration (mean days, from 10.3 in
   2008 to 9.7 in 2018; rate ratio for annual change, 0.98; 95\% CI,
   0.97-0.98) of MV. Noninvasive ventilation use increased from 57.9\% of
   infants in 2008 to 67.4\% in 2018 (adjusted relative risk for annual
   change, 1.02; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.03), and mean NIV duration increased by
   3.2 days (95\% CI, 2.9-3.6 days). With increased use of continuous
   positive airway pressure and nasal intermittent positive-pressure
   ventilation as the main factors in the increase, the mean duration of
   respiratory support increased from 13.8 to 15.4 days (adjusted rate
   ratio for annual change, 1.03; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.04) from 2008 to 2018.
   Among 1 169 441 infants in the national cohort, MV use decreased from
   22.0\% in 2008 to 18.5\% in 2018, with an estimated 29 700 fewer
   ventilated infants and 142 000 fewer days of MV than expected during
   this period.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that preterm
   respiratory support changed significantly from 2008 to 2018, with
   decreased use and duration of MV, increased use and duration of NIV, and
   an overall increase in respiratory support duration.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives-To identify and quantify any relations between occupational
   exposure to cadmium oxide fume and mortalities from lung cancer and from
   chronic nonmalignant diseases of the respiratory system.
   Methods-The mortality experience of 347 copper cadmium alloy workers,
   624 workers employed in the vicinity of copper cadmium alloy work
   (vicinity workers), and 521 iron and brass foundry workers (all men) was
   investigated for the period 1946-92. All subjects were first employed in
   these types of work in the period 1922-78 and for a minimum period of
   one year at one of two participating factories. Two analytical
   approaches were used, indirect standardisation and Poisson regression.
   Results-Compared with the general population of England and Wales,
   mortality from lung cancer among copper cadmium alloy workers was close
   to expectation (observed deaths 18, expected deaths 17 . 8, standardised
   mortality ratio (SMR) 101, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 60 to
   159). A significant excess was shown for lung cancer among vicinity
   workers but not among iron and brass foundry workers (vicinity workers:
   observed 55, expected 34 . 3, SMR 160, 95\% CI 121 to 209, P < 0 . 01;
   iron and brass foundry workers: observed 19, expected 17 . 8, SMR 107,
   95\% CI 64 to 167). Increased SMRs for non-malignant diseases of the
   respiratory system were shown for each of the three groups (alloy
   workers: observed 54, expected 23 . 5, SMR 230, 95\% CI 172 to 300, P <
   0 . 001; vicinity workers: observed 71, expected 43 . 0, SMR 165, 95\%
   CI 129 to 208, P < 0 . 001; iron and brass foundry workers: observed 34,
   expected 17 . 1, SMR 199, 95\% CI 137 to 278, P < 0 . 01). Work
   histories of the copper cadmium alloy workers were combined with
   independent assessments of cadmium exposures over time to develop
   individual estimates of cumulative exposure to cadmium; this being a
   time dependent variable. Poisson regression was used to investigate
   risks of lung cancer and risks of chronic non-malignant diseases of the
   respiratory system in relation to three levels of cumulative cadmium
   exposure (< 1600, 1600-4799, greater than or equal to 4800 mu g . m(-3).
   y). After adjustment for age, year of starting alloy work, factory, and
   time from starting alloy work, there was a significant positive trend (P
   < 0 . 01) between cumulative exposure to cadmium and risks of mortality
   from chronic non-malignant diseases of the respiratory system. Relative
   to a risk of unity for the lowest exposure category, risks were 4 . 54
   (95\% CI 1 . 96 to 10 . 51) for the middle exposure category and 4 . 74
   (95\% CI 1 . 81 to 12 . 43) for the highest exposure category. There was
   a non-significant negative trend between cumulative cadmium exposure and
   risks of mortality from lung cancer. Relative to a risk of unity for the
   lowest exposure category, risks were 0 . 85 (95\% CI 0 . 27 to 2 . 68)
   for the middle exposure category and 0 . 81 (95\% CI 0 . 18 to 3 . 73)
   for the highest exposure category. Similar findings were obtained when
   adjustment was made for age only.
   Conclusions-The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that
   exposure to cadmium oxide fume increases risks of mortality from chronic
   non-malignant diseases of the respiratory system. The findings do not
   support the hypothesis that exposure to cadmium oxide fume increases
   risks of mortality for lung cancer.}},

   and the characteristics of larval distribution among parous flies. The
   variance over mean ratio (VMR) indicated that in all cases this
   distribution departed from Poisson and was strongly aggregated (VMR >
   1). The negative binomial was found to be an adequate model with a small
   value of the aggregation parameter k, but the degree of larval
   overdispersion increased as the mean larval load decreased, invalidating
   the use of a common k, value. A lineal relationship between it and the
   mean (mu) was established, k(mu) = k(1)mu, which permitted exploration
   of the relationship between the observed proportion of infected flies,
   p, and the estimated mean larval bur den per fly, m (all larval stages
   in parous flies). This would allow mean numbers of larvae per parous fly
   to be predicted from presence-absence data (e.g., from infection rates
   provided by polymerase chain reaction methods applied to pools of
   flies), assuming that k(1) is a known parameter. Given that both, and m
   are naturally low in S. ochraceum, their relationship was practically
   linear within the range of observed values. Predictions were tested with
   the Mexican data from which the clumping parameter was estimated as well
   as for Guatemalan data for which this information was not available.
   Results showed a highly satisfactory degree of agreement between
   predictions and observations. The sample sizes required to estimate mean
   larval loads from prevalence data for fixed levels of precision (defined
   as the ratio between SE{[}m] and m) were calculated for realistic S.
   ochraceum infection rates (those found in published pre- and postcontrol
   field surveys as well as in this work). For the special case in which
   the relationship between k and. the mean is linear and goes through the
   origin, k(mu) = k(1)mu, the number of flies to be examined for O.
   volvulus infections does not explicitly depend on the aggregation
   parameter, but rather on the unknown proportion of infected flies.
   Practical recommendations for the calculation of sample sizes are
   discussed. For infection levels <0.2\%, a minimum number between 6,000
   and 13,000 parous flies would have to be examined to estimate the mean
   larval load with a precision between 0.20 and 0.30. The linearity
   between onchocercal infection rare and infection intensity in the fly
   population indicates that relationships between the former and
   onchocerciasis patterns in the human population should be further
   explored. for the purposes of monitoring the impact of ivermectin
   control programs through entomological evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Obesity increases the risk of hypertension and other chronic
   diseases, which are little known in rural China. This study aimed to
   investigate the epidemiologic features and the association with
   hypertension of obesity in rural Chinese women.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted during 2004 through
   2006, which used a multistage cluster sampling method to select a
   representative sample in Liaoning Province, China. In total 23 178 rural
   participants at least 35 y of age were examined (the percentage of
   subjects > 64 y old was 14.5\%). Data on demographic variables (age,
   sex, and race), smoking status, use of alcohol, physical activity, and
   education level were obtained by interview. Overweight and obesity were
   defined according to the World Health Organization classification.
   Hypertension was defined according to the criteria established by the
   Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee, and untreated
   hypertensive subjects were further classified into three subtypes:
   isolated systolic hypertension, isolated diastolic hypertension, and
   systolic and diastolic hypertension. Multivariable models and performed
   Poisson logistic regression analysis were used to determine associations
   among body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and variables.
   Results: Overall, the prevalences of overweight and obesity were 24.4\%
   and 2.7\%, respectively, as defined by BMI, whereas the prevalences were
   48.6\% and 4.9\% as defined by waist circumference. Poisson regression
   revealed that high levels of physical activity (defined by BMI,
   moderate: prevalence ratio {[}PR] 0.976,95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   0.965-0.988, high: PR 0.985,95\% CI 0.971-0.999; defined by waist
   circumference, moderate: PR 0.955, 95\% CI 0.944-0.965, high: PR 0.973,
   95\% CI 0.960-0.985) and current smoking status (defined by BMI. PR
   0.950, 95\% CI 0.938-0.962; defined by waist circumference, PR 0.966,
   95\% CI 0.954-0.978) were protective factors and ethnicity was a risk
   factor (defined by BMI. Mongolian nationality: PR 1.042, 95\% CI
   1.030-1.054; defined by waist circumference. PR 1.043,95\% CI
   1.033-1.054) for overweight or obese participants. There were other risk
   factors for overweight or obese participants such as high levels of
   education defined by BMI (PR 1.033, 95\% CI 1.010-1.058) and diet score
   defined by waist circumference (PR 1.004, 95\% CI 1.000-1.008). After
   adjustment, BMI and waist circumference were associated with the
   greatest likelihood of systolic and diastolic hypertension (for BMI >=
   30 kg/m(2), PR 2.455, 95\% CI 1.786-3.374; for waist circumference >= 88
   cm, PR 1.517, 95\% CI 1.133-2.031). BMI was more related to isolated
   diastolic hypertension than to isolated systolic hypertension, whereas
   waist circumference was more related to isolated systolic hypertension
   than to isolated diastolic hypertension.
   Conclusion: Although the prevalence of overweight and obesity as defined
   by BMI was low, it was relatively high as defined by waist circumference
   in rural Chinese women. High levels of physical activity and current
   smoking status had negative relations to overweight or obesity, whereas
   ethnicity, high levels of education, and diet score showed positive
   relations. Obese women defined by BMI or waist circumference had an
   increased risk of hypertension. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The discovery of novel materials with superior tailored properties is
   highly attractive for nano- and optoelectronics. Inspired by penta
   graphene, we introduce a novel family of two-dimensional group-IV
   materials with C-2 dimers, namely penta carbides. The first-principles
   calculations reveal that the unitary, binary, and ternary penta carbides
   have excellent energetic, dynamical, thermal, and mechanical stability
   with remarkable properties. The unitary penta carbide displays auxetic
   behavior whereas the binary and ternary penta carbides posses near zero
   and positive Poisson's ratio. The phonon dispersion curves of penta
   carbides indicate a remarkable phononic gap, which can be tuned by alloy
   engineering and hydrogenation. They are semiconductor in nature with
   band-gap energy ranging from 1.35 and 2.39 eV. Alloying and strain
   engineering enable the direct modification of atomic bonding and thereby
   tuning of electronic band gap of penta carbides. Such novel tunable
   electronic and phononic properties of penta carbides can find
   applications in the field of nanoelectronics, sensors, and frequency
   filter applications. The band edge positions of penta carbides (except
   for Sn-based ones) straddle the redox potentials of water. Remarkably,
   penta carbides exhibit very high optical absorption in the visible and
   ultraviolet regions (up to 10(-6) cm(-1)). They have small and
   anisotropic carrier effective masses, indicating fast carrier transport
   characteristics and promoting the photo-generated electron-hole
   separation efficiency. The high specific surface areas, suitable and
   sizable band gaps, appropriate band edges, small effective carrier
   masses, and excellent optical absorption capability, all these exotic
   properties taken together, make penta carbides promising candidates for
   photocatalytic water splitting.}},

Title = {{Optical spatial solitons in supercooled aqueous solutions}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{66}},

Month = {{MAY 5}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, nonlocal spatial solitons have attracted a great deal
   of attention. Optical spatial solitons result from the suppression of
   beam diffraction by the light-induced perturbed refractive index. For
   spatial nonlocal solitons, the light-induced perturbed refractive index
   of medium depends on the light intensity nonlocally, namely, the
   perturbed refractive index at a point is determined not only by the
   light intensity at that point but also by the light intensity in its
   vicinity. Such a spatial nonlocality may originate from heat transfer,
   like the nonlocal bright solitons in lead glass and dark solitons in
   liquids or gases. The perturbed refractive index. Delta n of lead glass
   or liquid is direct proportional to the light-induced temperature
   perturbation Delta t, i.e. Delta n = beta(1). Delta t. The proportional
   coefficient beta(1) is positive (negative) for lead glass (liquid), and
   the light-induced temperature perturbation. Delta t is determined by the
   Poisson equation del(2)(Delta t) = -DI, where I is the light intensity
   and D is a coefficient. In this paper, we investigate another type of
   thermal nonlinear effect, in which the perturbed refractive index. Delta
   n depends on the light-induced temperature perturbation. Delta t in a
   new way that Delta n = beta(1)Delta t + beta(2)(Delta t)(2). It has been
   indicated previously that the refractive index of a supercooled aqueous
   solution depends on the temperature, specifically n(t) = n(0) -
   beta(2)(t - t(0))(2), where n(0) = 1 : 337733 for 501 nm light wave,
   t(0) = -0.1 degrees C and beta(2) = 3 x 10(-6) K-2. So for t < t(0), the
   refractive index of aqueous solution increases with temperature rising,
   while t > t(0), it decreases with temperature increasing. In this paper,
   we use the numerical simulation method to investigate the propagation
   and interaction properties of optical solitons propagating in a
   supercooled aqueous solution, whose temperature on boundary is
   maintained at some value below t(0), with the aqueous solution placed in
   a thermostatic chamber. Obviously, the inner temperature of the solution
   rises, owing to absorbing some optical energies of the light beam
   propagating in it, and as a consequence the inner refractive index
   changes according to n(t) = n(0) - beta(2)(t - t(0))(2). For a soliton
   with a low power, the inner temperature t of the solution is always kept
   below t(0), so the refractive index at a point with a higher t is larger
   than that at another point with a lower t. In this case, the solution
   behaves as a self-focusing medium. A soliton with a higher power has a
   narrower beam width and a larger propagation constant, and the soliton
   takes a bell shape. However, for a soliton with a rather high power, the
   temperature in the core will be higher than t(0) while the temperature
   in the periphery is still below t(0). Therefore, the part of the
   solution in the core behaves as a self-defocusing medium while the part
   in the periphery behaves as a self-focusing medium. For such a case, the
   higher the power of the soliton, the larger the radius of the core is
   and the larger the beam width of the soliton, so the soliton takes a
   crater shape with a saturated propagation constant. Finally we also
   investigate the interaction between two solitons in a supercooled
   aqueous solution.
   For two neighboring beams with a rather high total power, they cannot
   maintain their individualities any more during the interaction, but
   merge into an expanding crater.}},

Title = {{Rates of cardiovascular disease following smoking cessation in patients

Journal = {{HIV MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{412-421}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   The aim of the study was to estimate the rates of cardiovascular disease
   (CVD) events after stopping smoking in patients with HIV infection.
   Methods
   Patients who reported smoking status and no previous CVD prior to
   enrolment in the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:
   A: D) study were included in this study. Smoking status is collected at
   each visit as current smoker (yes/no) and ever smoker (yes/no). Time
   since stopping smoking was calculated for persons who had reported
   current smoking during follow-up and no current smoking subsequently.
   Endpoints were: myocardial infarction (MI); coronary heart disease (CHD:
   MI plus invasive coronary artery procedure or death from other CHD); CVD
   (CHD plus carotid artery endarterectomy or stroke); and all-cause
   mortality. Event rates were calculated for never, previous and current
   smokers, and smokers who stopped during follow-up. Incidence rate ratios
   (IRRs) were determined using Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex,
   cohort, calendar year, family history of CVD, diabetes, lipids, blood
   pressure and antiretroviral treatment.
   Results
   A total of 27136 patients had smoking status reported, with totals of
   432, 600, 746 and 1902 MI, CHD, CVD and mortality events, respectively.
   The adjusted IRR of CVD in patients who stopped smoking during follow-up
   decreased from 2.32 within the first year of stopping to 1.49 after >3
   years compared with those who never smoked. Similar trends were observed
   for the MI and CHD endpoints. Reductions in risk were less pronounced
   for all-cause mortality.
   Conclusion
   The risk of CVD events in HIV-positive patients decreased with
   increasing time since stopping smoking. Smoking cessation efforts should
   be a priority in the management of HIV-positive patients.}},

Abstract = {{Meta-biomaterials are designer biomaterials with unusual and even
   unprecedented properties that primarily originate from their geometrical
   designs at different (usually smaller) length scales. This concept has
   been primarily used in the context of orthopedic biomaterials with the
   ultimate aim of improving the bone tissue regeneration performance of
   implants and decreasing the risk of implant-associated infections. In
   this paper, we review the ways though which geometrical design at the
   macro-, micro-, and nanoscales combined with advanced additive
   manufacturing techniques (3D printing) could be used to create the
   unusual properties of meta-biomaterials. Due to their intended
   applications in orthopedics, metallic and hard polymeric biomaterials
   have received the most attention in the literature. However, the
   reviewed concepts are, at least in principle, applicable to a wide range
   of biomaterials including ceramics and soft polymers. At the macroscale,
   we discuss the concepts of patient-specific implants, deployable
   meta-implants, and shape-morphing implants. At the microscale, we
   introduce the concept of multi-physics meta-biomaterials while also
   covering the applications of auxetic meta-biomaterials for improving the
   longevity of orthopedic implants. At the nanoscale, the different
   aspects of the geometrical design of surface nanopatterns that
   simultaneously stimulate the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells
   and kill bacteria are presented. The concept of origami-based
   meta-biomaterials and the applications of self-folding mechanisms in the
   fabrication of meta-biomaterials are addressed next. We conclude with a
   discussion on the available evidence regarding the superior performance
   of meta-biomaterials and suggest some possible avenues for future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present an innovative three-dimensional (3D)
   hierarchical design strategy to systematically summarize the
   configuration characteristics of existing cellular structures and
   propose a novel class of mechanical metamaterials based on topology
   analysis, which have tailored Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus.
   Theoretical, numerical and experimental analyses were conducted to
   reveal the basic mechanical properties of the metamaterials. And these
   results agree very well which validate the correctness of the theories.
   Samples of the proposed structures made of Nylon were fabricated through
   3D printing technology to carry out compression tests and finite element
   analysis (FEA) were performed to give an insight into the mechanical
   response. Experimental and numerical results revealed that the proposed
   3D second-order hierarchical metamaterials can achieve a series of
   special combinations of Poisson's ratio in three perpendicular
   directions. The sign and magnitude of Poisson's ratio can be tailored by
   appropriately adjusting the first and second order configurations and
   their geometrical parameters. Meanwhile, systemic analysis and
   comparison reveal that relative Young's modulus is contingent on
   deformation pattern, i.e., axial-deformation dominated stiffness is much
   higher than bending-dominated stiffness. Similar to Poisson's ratio, the
   magnitude of Young's modulus can be tailored by geometrical parameters
   and first and second order configurations in a relative large range in
   the case of given Poisson's ratio (sign and magnitude). This work can
   provide useful reference for the design, fabrication and analysis of 3D
   metamaterials with novel properties and functions, particularly with
   auxetic behavior, which are promising in some technical applications.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{(Fe81-xCoxGa19)(80)B-20 ribbons, with x = 0, 7, 11, 19, and 23, were
   made by the single-roller quenching method. The x-ray diffraction
   patterns showed the A2, D0(19), and L1(2) diffraction peaks coexisting
   with the amorphous matrix background. When Fe was replaced by Co, i.e.,
   when x was increased, the first crystallization temperature (T-X1) and
   Curie temperature (T-C1) rose greatly. With a sufficiently heavy load
   (or weight) stretching the ribbon downward, the magnetization MS was
   pulled along the vertical direction (i.e., the tension-axis). Then, by
   applying a horizontal field (H-E) up to 6 KOe, we determined the sign
   and magnitude of the saturation magnetostriction (lambda(S)). The
   Young's modulus (E-S) at magnetization saturation and Delta E effect was
   estimated from the stress-strain curve. We discovered that the
   stress-strain curve of (Fe81Ga19)(80)B-20 exhibits the auxetic (or

Abstract = {{This chapter begins with a general discussion of the future needs for
   large space reflectors (lighter, larger, foldable), leading to the
   concept of adaptive thin polymer shell reflector. Next, a comparison
   between an adaptive plate covered with a layer of piezoelectric material
   and a similar spherical shell is conducted to point out the fundamental
   difference of behavior of a shell with double curvature (because of the
   large hoop stiffness). A multi-electrode spherical shell is considered,
   and the relationship between the surface figure error and the electrode
   size, the shell curvature and thickness is derived (for various Zernike
   modes). Then, the control of adaptive shell involving a very large
   number (thousands) of independent electrodes is examined and, based on
   Saint-Venant's principle, a hierarchical control approach is derived to
   solve the ill-conditioning of the Jacobian. Finally, petal
   configurations are considered as away to increase the controllability
   and improve the folding capability. The chapter concludes with a
   reference list.}},

   Costs in Patients with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus requires continuous medical care and
   patient self-management in order to prevent short-term complications and
   decrease the risk of long-term complications, which can result in
   substantial increases in the total economic burden of the disease.
   Findings from randomized clinical trials have shown that improved
   glycemic control may reduce the risk of long-term complications as long
   as a target for hemoglobin A1c is not set below 7\% for intensive
   glycemic control. However, limited data from clinical practice are
   available regarding the relationship between glycemic control and
   medical costs associated with diabetes care
   OBJECTIVE. To assess the potential relationships between glycemic
   levels, diabetes-related hospitalizations, and hospital costs among
   adult patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus who were
   assigned to a primary care provider (PCP) in a clinic that was
   affiliated with a managed care organization (MCO).
   METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using data from
   approximately 200,000 members of the Fallon Clinic Health Plan who were
   assigned to a clinic PCP at any time during a 5-year study period
   beginning January 1, 2002, and ending December 31, 2006. Patients aged
   30 years or older with at least 2 medical claims with any listed
   diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (ICD-9-CM code 250.xx) during the study
   period and 2 or more A1c values within 1 year of each other during the
   study period (mean 7.6 tests over 39 months; median=6.8), were
   identified and stratified into 1 of 5 groups defined by 1\% increments
   of A1c, based on their mean A1c values during the entire study period.
   A1c data were available only for tests ordered by a clinic provider,
   tests ordered by other specialists in the MCO's network were absent from
   the database. The study follow-up period started with each patient's
   first A1c test (index date) and continued until plan disenrollment,
   death, or December 31, 2006, whichever was earlier (end date),
   regardless of when the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was made. Study
   measures included the proportion of patients with 1 or more
   diabetes-related hospitalizations, number of diabetes-related inpatient
   stays, and the associated estimated hospitalization costs over the
   follow-up period Diabetes-related hospitalizations were identified based
   on a diagnosis, in any of 10 diagnosis fields, for 1 of 16 selected
   complications of diabetes identified by the authors. Hospital costs were
   estimated using discharge data (diagnoses and costs calculated from
   cost-to-charge ratios) contained in the 2004 Healthcare Cost and
   Utilization Project (HCUP) database and inflated to 2007 dollars using
   the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. Multivariate
   models controlled for age, sex, number of A1c tests, diagnosis of
   cancer, and follow-up time A multivariate logistic regression analysis
   was conducted with the occurrence of at least 1 diabetes-related
   hospital admission as the dependent variable In the logistic regression
   analysis, follow-up time was defined as time from the index date to the
   date of the first diabetes-related hospitalization, plan disenrollment,
   death, or the study end date, whichever occurred first. A generalized
   linear model with a Poisson distribution and a log link was employed to
   estimate the rate of hospital admissions In the Poisson regression
   analysis, follow-up time was defined as duration of the entire study
   follow-up period and was an offset variable. Costs were estimated using
   a 2-part model. first, we calculated the probability of having a
   hospitalization, as determined by the logistic regression above; second,
   a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution and a
   log link was used to predict the mean cost of diabetes-related
   hospitalizations only for patients with an inpatient stay, with the
   duration of the entire study follow-up period as an offset variable. We
   calculated the mean per patient cost of diabetes-related
   hospitalizations by multiplying the probability of having a
   hospitalization (as determined by the first part of the model) by the
   mean costs for patients who had such admissions (as determined by the
   second part of the model).
   RESULTS: 9,887 patients met study selection criteria Mean A1c level was
   <7\% for 5,649 (57.1\%) patients, 7\% to <8\% for 2,747 (27 8\%), 8\% to
   <9\% for 1,002 (10.1\%), 9\% to <10\% for 312 (3.2\%), and 10\% or more
   for 177 (1 8\%). Over a mean (median) 40 (40) months of follow-up
   (interquartile range= 30-50 months), 287\% (n=2,838) of patients had 1
   or more diabetes-related hospital admissions In the logistic regression
   analysis, odds of having at least 1 diabetes-related hospital stay did
   not significantly differ for patients with mean A1c of <7\% compared
   with patients in most higher mean A1c categories (7\% to <8\%, 8\% to
   <9\%, or 9\% to <10\%), however, odds of having a diabetes-related
   hospitalization were significantly higher for patients with mean A1c of
   10\% or more compared with patients with mean A1c of <7\% (odds
   ratio=2.13, 95\% confidence interval =1.36-3.33). In the negative
   binomial regression analysis of those with at least 1 hospital
   admission, estimated costs per hospitalized patient increased by mean
   A1c level. In the Poisson regression analysis, the rate of
   diabetes-related hospitalizations significantly increased by A1c level
   (13 per 100 patient-years for patients with mean A1c of <7\% vs. 30 per
   100 patient-years for mean A1c of 10\% or more when covariates were held
   at mean levels, P<0.001) In the 2-part model results, adjusted mean
   estimated costs of diabetes-related hospitalizations per study patient
   were \$2,792 among those with mean A1c of <7\% and \$6,759 among those
   with mean A1c of 10\% or more.
   CONCLUSIONS. In this managed-care plan, the odds of having at least 1
   diabetes-related hospitalization were not significantly associated with
   higher mean A1c except for patients with mean A1c of at least 10\%.
   However, higher mean A1c levels were associated with significantly
   higher estimated hospitalization costs among those with at least 1
   hospitalization and with higher rates of diabetes-related hospital
   utilization per 100 patient-years.}},

Abstract = {{Research activities in smart materials and structures represent a
   significant potential for technological innovation in mechanics and
   electronics. The necessity of controlling vibroacoustic behavior of
   industrial systems motivates a broad research effort for introducing
   active or passive technologies to control noise and vibrations. New
   processes are now available which allow active transducers and their
   driving electronics to be directly integrated into otherwise passive
   structures. This new approach could allow fine control of the material
   physical behavior for implementing new functional properties that do not
   exist in nature. In this sense, we can speak of ``'integrated
   distributed adaptive metacomposite{''}' that merges the notion of
   programmable materials with periodic structures and metamaterial. One of
   the main features associated to the periodic distribution of mechanical
   devices, the ability to design Bragg or resonant band gaps, is improved
   by using smart transducers and adaptive electronic circuits. Early
   developments of these technologies were based on analytical techniques;
   therefore many results are available for simple coupled systems (MDOF,
   beams, and plates). More recently, the combination of periodicity
   theories with the finite element method has allowed designers to handle
   complex geometries, smart materials and electronic components for
   optimizing waves diffusion in complex damped and coupled media. In this
   talk, after some reminders concerning historical aspects, the main
   methodologies for the design of periodic structures will be given,
   before showing two applications combining periodicity and smart
   structures (auxetic materials, semi-active and active strategies, waves
   in damped media) for vibroacoustic applications. All practical aspects
   will be discussed, from the numerical tools for design and optimization,
   to the practical implementation for experimental validation, together
   with robustness issues.}},

Pages = {{278-287}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is the production of mechanical meta-material
   samples by rapid prototyping (RP) and replica technique for
   patient-specific skin graft or cranial implant applications in tissue
   engineering.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Positive moulds (patterns) were produced by stereolithography-based RP.
   Impression moulding method was used for the production of silicone
   products (skin grafts). Alginate was used as a moulding material
   (negative mould). Room temperature vulcanising silicone was poured into
   the cavity of alginate mould and then products were produced. TiO2
   powder and carbon fibres were used as reinforcement. Meta-material
   structured polyurethane reinforced silicone composites were also
   produced. Liquid components (diisocyanate and polyol) were poured into
   the mould and then polyurethane was produced. Then, polyurethane was
   immersed in the liquid silicone.
   Findings
   It is found that non-destructive ultrasonic test is a fast and reliable
   method. Meta-material-based composites show dome-shaped
   tensile/synclastic surface properties which are important for the skin
   graft and cranial implants. Increasing the amounts of cross-linking
   agent and TiO2 particles increased the hardness and elastic modulus.
   Carbon fibre addition enhanced the elastic modulus.
   Originality/value
   Although there are studies on the meta-materials, there is limited study
   on the RP of the meta-materials for patient-specific implants (skin
   grafts). Auxetic surface shows perfect fit to curved surface of the
   skull. Although there are studies on the silicone and polyurethane
   composites, there is limited study on the characterisation of mechanical
   properties by ultrasonic tests and strain gauge analysis.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Although animal experiments have shown that cadmium exposure
   results in severe dental caries, limited epidemiologic data are
   available on this issue.
   OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the relationship between environmental
   cadmium exposure and dental caries in children 6-12 years of age.
   METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data, including urine cadmium
   concentrations and counts of decayed or filled tooth surfaces, from the
   Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We used logistic
   and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression to estimate the
   association between urine cadmium concentrations and caries experience,
   adjusting these analyses for potential confounders including
   environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).
   RESULTS: Urine cadmium concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 3.38 ng/mL.
   Approximately 56\% of children had experienced caries in their deciduous
   teeth, and almost 30\% had been affected by caries in their permanent
   dentition. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in creatinine-corrected
   cadmium concentrations (0.21 mu g/g creatinine) corresponded to a 16\%
   increase in the odds of having experienced caries in deciduous teeth
   {[}prevalence odds ratio (OR) = 1.16; 95\% confidence interval (CI),
   0.96-1.40]. This association was statistically significant in children
   with low ETS exposure (prevalence OR = 1.30; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.67). The
   results from the ZINB regression indicated that, among children with any
   caries history in their deciduous teeth, an IQR increase in cadmium was
   associated with 17\% increase in the number of decayed or filled
   surfaces. We observed no association between cadmium and caries
   experience in permanent teeth.
   CONCLUSIONS: Environmental cadmium exposure may be associated with
   increased risk of dental caries in deciduous teeth of children.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether abnormal plasma placental growth factor
   (PlGF) level is associated with adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes.
   METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of the Preeclampsia Triage by
   Rapid Assay Trial (PETRA), a prospective, multicenter, observational
   study that enrolled women with suspected preeclampsia. Our analysis
   included women age 18-45 years with a singleton pregnancy between 20 and
   41 weeks of gestation. Plasma collected at enrollment was used for PlGF
   measurement. Abnormal PlGF was defined as low (100 pg/mL or less) or
   very low (less than 12 pg/mL). The primary outcomes were composite
   adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes. We used multivariable Poisson
   regression models to examine the association between PlGF and outcomes.
   RESULTS: Of 1,112 women who met the inclusion criteria, plasma PlGF was
   low in 742 (67\%) and very low in 353 (32\%). In the cohort, the overall
   rates of the composite adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes were 6.4\%
   and 4.8\%, respectively. Compared with normal PlGF (more than 100
   pg/mL), low PlGF was significantly associated with an increased risk of
   the composite neonatal outcome (9.2\% vs 0.8\%; adjusted relative risk
   {[}aRR] 17.2, 95\% CI 5.2-56.3), and the composite maternal outcome
   (6.2\% vs 1.9\%; aRR 3.6, 95\% CI 1.7-8.0). Very low PlGF was also
   significantly associated with both neonatal and maternal outcomes. The
   sensitivity and specificity of low PlGF were 95.8\% and 35.3\%,
   respectively, for the composite neonatal outcome, and 86.8\% and 34.3\%
   for the composite maternal outcome. Although the positive predictive
   values were low (9.2\% and 6.2\%, respectively), the negative predictive
   value of low PlGF for neonatal and maternal outcomes was 99.2\% and
   98.1\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Among women being evaluated for
   preeclampsia, those with abnormal PlGF are significantly more likely to
   experience adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes. These outcomes occur
   infrequently when the PlGF is normal. These findings suggest that PlGF
   may be useful for risk stratification of women with suspected
   preeclampsia. FUNDING SOURCE: No funding was received for this study.

Abstract = {{In statistical modelling, it is often of interest to evaluate
   non-negative quantities that capture heterogeneity in the population
   such as variances, mixing proportions and dispersion parameters. In
   instances of covariate-dependent heterogeneity, the implied homogeneity
   hypotheses are nonstandard and existing inferential techniques are not
   applicable. In this paper, we develop a quasi-score test statistic to
   evaluate homogeneity against heterogeneity that varies with a covariate
   profile through a regression model. We establish the limiting null
   distribution of the proposed test as a functional of mixtures of
   chi-square processes. The methodology does not require the full
   distribution of the data to be entirely specified. Instead, a general
   estimating function for a finite dimensional component of the model,
   that is, of interest is assumed but other characteristics of the
   population are left completely unspecified. We apply the methodology to
   evaluate the excess zero proportion in zero-inflated models for count
   data. Our numerical simulations show that the proposed test can greatly
   improve efficiency over tests of homogeneity that neglect covariate
   information under the alternative hypothesis. An empirical application
   to dental caries indices demonstrates the importance and practical
   utility of the methodology in detecting excess zeros in the data.}},

Abstract = {{The HET-MN assay (hen's egg test for micronucleus induction) is
   different from other in vitro genotoxicity assays in that it includes
   toxicologically important features such as absorption, distribution,
   metabolic activation, and excretion of the test compound. As a promising
   follow-up to complement existing in vitro test batteries for
   genotoxicity, the HET-MN is currently undergoing a formal validation. To
   optimize the validation, the present study describes a critical analysis
   of previously obtained HET-MN data to check the experimental design and
   to identify the most appropriate statistical procedure to evaluate
   treatment effects. Six statistical challenges (I-VI) of general
   relevance were identified, and remedies were provided which can be
   transferred to similarly designed test methods: a Williams-type trend
   test is proposed for overdispersed counts (II) by means of a square-root
   transformation which is robust for small sample sizes (I), variance
   heterogeneity (III), and possible downturn effects at high doses (IV).
   Due to near-to-zero or even zero-count data occurring in the negative
   control (V), a conditional comparison of the treatment groups against
   the mean of the historical controls (VI) instead of the concurrent
   control was proposed, which is in accordance with US-FDA
   recommendations. For the modified Williams-type tests, the power can be
   estimated depending on the magnitude and shape of the trend, the number
   of dose groups, and the magnitude of the MN counts in the negative
   control. The experimental design used previously (i.e. six eggs per dose
   group, scoring of 1000 cells per egg) was confirmed. The proposed
   approaches are easily available in the statistical computing environment
   R, and the corresponding R-codes are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Tuberculosis among health care workers in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: a
   retrospective cohort analysis}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is an occupational hazard for health care
   workers (HCWs) who are at greater risk of developing TB than the general
   population. The objective of this study was to compare the difference in
   TB incidence among HCWs with versus without a history of working in TB
   wards, to estimate the incidence of TB among HCWs, and to identify risk
   factors for TB disease in HCWs.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study (January 2006 to December 2010)
   was conducted in three district hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal, South
   Africa. Data were abstracted via chart review from occupational health
   medical records. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed
   using a Poisson multilevel mixed model.
   Results: Of 1,313 (92\%) medical charts reviewed with data on location
   of work documented, 112 (9\%) cases of TB were identified. Among HCWs
   with TB 14 (13\%) had multidrug-resistant TB. Thirty-six (32\%) were
   cured, 33 (29\%) completed treatment, and 13 (12\%) died. An increased
   incidence of TB was reported for HCWs with a history of working in TB
   wards (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] 2.03, 95\% CI 1.11-3.71), pediatric
   wards (IRR 1.82 95\% CI 1.07-3.10), outpatient departments (IRR 2.08
   95\% CI 1.23-3.52), and stores/workshop (IRR 2.38 95\% CI 1.06-5.34)
   compared with those without such a history. HCWs living with HIV had a
   greater incidence of TB (IRR 3.2, 95\% CI 1.54-6.66) than HIV-negative
   HCWs. TB incidence among HCWs was approximately two-fold greater than
   that of the general population over the study period.
   Conclusions: HCWs working in a TB ward had an increased incidence of TB.
   However, a greater incidence of TB was also found in HCWs working in
   other wards including pediatric wards, outpatient departments and
   stores. We also identified a greater incidence of TB among HCWs than the
   general population. These findings further support the need for improved
   infection control measures not only in TB or drug-resistant TB wards or
   areas perceived to be at high-risk but also throughout hospitals to
   protect HCWs. Additionally, it is recommended for occupational health
   services to routinely screen HCWs for TB and provide HCWs with access to
   care for TB and HIV.}},

Abstract = {{The 121 mining method of longwall mining first proposed in England has
   been widely used around the world. This method requires excavation of
   two mining roadways and reservation of one coal pillar to mine one
   working face. Due to considerable excavation of roadway, the mining
   roadway is generally destroyed during coal mining. The stress
   concentration in the coal pillar can cause large deformation of
   surrounding rocks, rockbursts and other disasters, and subsequently a
   large volume of coal pillar resources will be wasted. To improve the
   coal recovery rate and reduce excavation of the mining roadway, the 111
   mining method of longwall mining was proposed in the former Soviet Union
   based on the 121 mining method. The 111 mining method requires
   excavation of one mining roadway and setting one filling body to replace
   the coal pillar while maintaining another mining roadway to mine one
   working face. However, because the stress transfer structure of roadway
   and working face roof has not changed, the problem of stress
   concentration in the surrounding rocks of roadway has not been well
   solved. To solve the above problems, the conventional concept utilizing
   high-strength support to resist the mining pressure for the 121 and 111
   mining methods should be updated. The idea is to utilize mining pressure
   and expansion characteristics of the collapsed rock mass in the goaf to
   automatically form roadways, avoiding roadway excavation and waste of
   coal pillar. Based on the basic principles of mining rock mechanics, the
   ``equilibrium mining{''} theory and the ``short cantilever beam{''}
   mechanical model are proposed. Key technologies, such as roof
   directional presplitting technology, negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   high-prestress constant-resistance support technology, and gangue
   blocking support technology, are developed following the ``equilibrium
   mining{''} theory. Accordingly, the 110 and N00 mining methods of an
   automatically formed roadway (AFR) by roof cutting and pressure
   releasing without pillars are proposed. The mining methods have been
   applied to a large number of coal mines with different overburdens, coal
   seam thicknesses, roof types and gases in China, realizing the
   integrated mode of coal mining and roadway retaining. On this basis, in
   view of the complex geological conditions and intelligent mining demand
   of coal mines, an intelligent and unmanned development direction of the
   ``equilibrium mining{''} method is prospected. (C) 2021 Institute of

Abstract = {{Introduction: The co-occurrence of alcohol use and smoking during
   pregnancy has been shown to have a negative synergistic effect on fetal
   and perinatal risks. The objectives were to: 1) obtain an estimate of
   the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy in Canada by province and
   territory from 2003 to 2011/12; 2) determine if the prevalence of
   smoking during pregnancy has increased or decreased over time; 3)
   investigate whether smoking status is differentially associated with
   alcohol use during pregnancy; and 4) examine the risk factors predictive
   of alcohol use only, smoking only, and the co-occurrence of alcohol use
   and smoking during pregnancy. Methods: Secondary data analysis was
   conducted using five cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey
   (CCHS; 2003, 2005, 2007/08, 2009/10 and 2011/12). The prevalence of
   smoking during pregnancy, and 95\% confidence interval (CI) was
   calculated by province and territory and by year. The likelihood ratio
   test was used to determine if the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy
   has increased or decreased over time. The relationship between smoking
   status and alcohol use during pregnancy was explored using a
   quasi-Poisson regression model. A mulfinomial logistic regression model
   was utilized to determine which factors were predictive of alcohol use
   only, smoking only, and the co-occurrence of alcohol use and smoking
   during pregnancy. Results: In Canada, between 2003 and 2011/12, the
   weighted pooled prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was 143\% (95\%
   Cl: 13.6\%-15.0\%). Women who smoked daily during pregnancy,
   occasionally during pregnancy, or had a lifetime history of smoking (but
   did not smoke while pregnant) were 2.54 (95\% CI: 2.11-3.06, P <
   0.0001), 2.71 (95\% CI: 2.25-327, P < 0.0001), and 2.09 (95\% CI:
   1.85-237, P < 0.0001), respectively, times more likely to have consumed
   alcohol during pregnancy, compared to pregnant women who were lifetime
   non-smokers when controlling for age, household income, ethnicity and
   CCHS cycle. Risk factors that predicted alcohol use only, smoking only,
   and the co-occurrence of alcohol use and smoking during pregnancy
   differed. Conclusion: It is apparent that smoking in any capacity,
   whether during pregnancy or not, increases the likelihood that a woman
   consumed alcohol while pregnant. Ascertaining smoking status among

Abstract = {{Background Universal antiretroviral therapy (ART), as per the 2015 WHO
   recommendations, might reduce population HIV incidence. We investigated
   the effect of universal test and treat on HIV acquisition at population
   level in a high prevalence rural region of South Africa.
   Methods We did a phase 4, open-label, cluster randomised trial of 22
   communities in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We included
   individuals residing in the communities who were aged 16 years or older.
   The clusters were composed of aggregated local areas (neighbourhoods)
   that had been identified in a previous study in the Hlabisa subdistrict.
   The study statisticians randomly assigned clusters (1:1) with MapInfo
   Pro (version 11.0) to either the control or intervention communities,
   stratified on the basis of antenatal HIV prevalence. We offered
   residents repeated rapid HIV testing during home-based visits every 6
   months for about 4 years in four clusters, 3 years in six clusters, and
   2 years in 12 clusters (58 cluster-years) and referred HIV-positive
   participants to trial clinics for ART (fixed-dose combination of
   tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz) regardless of CD4 cell count
   (intervention) or according to national guidelines (initially <= 350
   cells per mu L and <500 cells per mu L from January, 2015; control).
   Participants and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation.
   We used dried blood spots once every 6 months provided by participants
   who were HIV negative at baseline to estimate the primary outcome of HIV
   incidence with cluster-adjusted Poisson generalised estimated equations
   in the intention-to-treat population after 58 cluster-years of
   follow-up. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number
   NCT01509508, and the South African National Clinical Trials Register,
   number DOH-27-0512-3974.
   Findings Between March 9, 2012, and June 30, 2016, we contacted 26 518
   (93\%) of 28 419 eligible individuals. Of 17 808 (67\%) individuals with
   a first negative dried blood spot test, 14 223 (80\%) had subsequent
   dried blood spot tests, of whom 503 seroconverted after follow-up of 22
   891 person-years. Estimated HIV incidence was 2.11 per 100 person-years
   (95\% CI 1.84-2.39) in the intervention group and 2.27 per 100
   person-years (2.00-2.54) in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio
   1.01, 95\% CI 0.87-1.17; p=0.89). We documented one case of suicidal
   attempt in a woman following HIV seroconversion. 128 patients on ART had
   189 life-threatening or grade 4 clinical events: 69 (4\%) of 1652 in the
   control group and 59 (4\%) of 1367 in the intervention group (p=0.83).
   Interpretation The absence of a lowering of HIV incidence in universal
   test and treat clusters most likely resulted from poor linkage to care.
   Policy change to HIV universal test and treat without innovation to
   improve health access is unlikely to reduce HIV incidence.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction The timing of cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis has
   been debated with most studies favoring early cholecystectomy (< 72 h of
   onset). However, most reported studies are from single institution
   studies with only a few population-based studies. The purpose of this
   study is to compare clinical outcomes of patients undergoing
   cholecystectomy within 72 h of emergency department (ED) presentation to
   patients undergoing cholecystectomy following 72 h in a large statewide
   database. Methods The New York SPARCS administrative database was used
   to identify all adult patients presenting to the ED with a diagnosis of
   acute cholecystitis from 2005 to 2016. Patients aged < 18, missing data,
   or other biliary diagnoses were excluded from the analysis. Early
   cholecystectomy was defined as within 72 h of presentation to the
   emergency department. Early vs late groups were compared in terms of
   overall complications, bile duct injury (BDI), hospital length of stay
   (LOS), 30-days ED visits and readmissions. The linear trends of yearly
   early/late cholecystectomies were examined using a log-linear Poisson
   regression models. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to
   compare complications, BDI, and 30-day readmission/ED visits after
   controlling for confounding factors. Multivariable generalized linear
   regression for a negative binomial distributed count data was used to
   compare LOS. Results Following the application of the
   inclusion/exclusion criteria, there were 109,862 patients who presented
   to an ED with the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The majority of
   patients underwent early cholecystectomy (n = 93,761, 85.3\%), whereas
   only 16,101 patients underwent late cholecystectomy (14.7\%). There was
   an increasing trend of early cholecystectomy from 2005 (81.1\%) to 2016
   (87.8\%). On multivariable regression, patients with early
   cholecystectomy were less likely to have complications (OR 0.542, 95\%
   CI 0.518-0.566), had shorter LOS (ratio 0.461, 95\% CI 0.458-0.465),
   were less likely to have 30-day readmission (OR 0.871, 95\% CI
   0.816-0.928), 30-day ED visits (OR 0.909, 95\% CI 0.862-0.959), and bile
   duct injury (OR 0.654, 95\% CI 0.444-0.962) compared to late
   cholecystectomy patients. Conclusion Early cholecystectomy (< 72 h) is
   associated with fewer complications, specifically BDI, shorter LOS, and
   fewer 30-day readmissions and ED visits. For patients presenting to the
   ED for acute cholecystitis, early cholecystectomy should be preferred.}},

Abstract = {{Northern Italy has been the first European area affected by the COVID-19
   pandemic and related social restrictive measures. We sought to evaluate
   the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on PICU admissions in Northern
   Italy, using data from the Italian Network of Pediatric Intensive Care
   Units Registry. We included all patients admitted to 4 PICUs from
   8-weeks-before to 8-weeks-after February 24(th), 2020, and those
   admitted in the same period in 2019. Incidence rate ratios (IRR)
   evaluating incidence rate differences between pre- and post-COVID-19
   periods in 2020 (IRR-1), as well as between the post-COVID-19-period
   with the same period in 2019 (IRR-2), were computed using zero-inflated
   negative binomial or Poisson regression modeling. A total of 1001
   admissions were included. The number of PICU admissions significantly
   decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to pre-COVID-19 and
   compared to the same period in 2020 (IRR-1 0.63 {[}95\%CI 0.50-0.79];

   Unplanned and medical PICU admissions significantly decreased during
   COVID-19 outbreak, especially those for respiratory failure. What is
   Known: center dot Northern Italy has been the first European area
   affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. center dot Although children are
   relatively spared from the severe COVID-19 disease, the pediatric care
   system has been affected by social restrictive measures, with a reported
   73-88\% reduction in pediatric emergency department admissions. What is
   New: center dot Unplanned and medical PICU admissions significantly
   decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to pre-COVID-19 and to
   the same period in 2019, especially those for respiratory failure.
   Further studies are needed to identify associated factors and new

Abstract = {{Introduction Over the last decade, a number of delivery units have been
   closed in Sweden, justified by both economic incentives and patient
   safety issues. However, concentrating births to larger delivery units
   naturally increases travel time for some parturient women, which may
   lead to unintended negative consequences. We aimed to investigate the
   association between travel time to delivery unit and unplanned
   out-of-hospital birth, and subsequent infant morbidity and mortality.
   Material and methods We performed a population-based cohort study
   including 365 604 women in the Swedish Pregnancy Register, giving birth
   between 2014 and 2017. Modified Poisson regression was used to
   investigate the association between travel time from home address to
   actual delivery unit, based on geographic information system analysis,
   and risk of an unplanned out-of-hospital birth. Analyses were stratified
   by parity and urban/rural residence. Lastly, the associations between an
   unplanned out-of-hospital birth and severe infant morbidity, stillbirth,
   peripartum, perinatal and neonatal mortality were investigated.
   Results Of those with an unplanned out-of-hospital birth (n = 2159),
   65\% had a travel time up to 30 minutes. A travel time between 31 and 60
   minutes was associated with a doubled risk of unplanned out-of-hospital
   birth (adjusted risk ratio {[}RR] 1.96, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   1.74-2.22) and women with a travel time of more than 1 hour had an
   adjusted RR of 3.19 (95\% CI 2.64-3.86), compared with those with a
   travel time of <30 minutes. No difference in results was seen when
   stratified for parity and urban/rural residence. No association was
   found between unplanned out-of-hospital birth and severe infant
   morbidity. Significant associations were found in crude analyses for
   stillbirth (RR 1.85, 95\% CI 1.09-3.13), peripartum (RR 1.93, 95\% CI
   1.18-3.16), perinatal (RR 2.03, 95\% CI 1.28-3.23) and neonatal
   mortality (RR 3.08, 95\% CI 1.27-7.46), although neonatal mortality was
   very rare (2.3/1000 out-of-hospital births). Similar effect estimates
   were found in the adjusted analyses, though no longer significant.
   Conclusions Although the majority of unplanned out-of-hospital births
   occurred in the group of women with a travel time of 0-30 minutes,
   increasing travel time to a delivery unit is associated with unplanned
   out-of-hospital birth, which may increase the risk of mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in
   reducing the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma, HIV-infected individuals who
   have responded to treatment continue to be diagnosed with Kaposi
   sarcoma. We examine factors associated with the incidence of Kaposi
   sarcoma among cART-treated HIV-infected homosexual men and changes in
   their survival after its diagnosis over calendar time.
   Data were from HIV-infected homosexual men with well-estimated dates of
   HIV seroconversion (ie, change in status from being HIV negative to
   having HIV antibodies detected). Incidence of Kaposi sarcoma was
   calculated. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to determine survival after
   Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis in three calendar periods: before 1996,
   1996-2000, and 2001-2006. Poisson models were used to examine the effect
   of risk factors such as current and nadir CD4 cell count (ie, the lowest
   CD4 cell count ever recorded for a person), duration of infection, and
   age at diagnosis for Kaposi sarcoma incidence in cART-treated men. All
   statistical tests were two-sided.
   Among the 9473 men, 555 were diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma in the period
   1986-2006, of whom 319 died. The percentage surviving 24 months after
   Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis rose statistically significantly during the
   study period from 35\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 29\% to 42\%)
   before 1996 to 84\% (95\% CI = 76\% to 90\%) in 1996-2000 and to 81\%
   (95\% CI = 70\% to 88\%) in 2001-2006 (P < .001). Seventy men were
   diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma after starting cART. Current (ie, within 6
   months) CD4 cell count was associated with incidence of Kaposi sarcoma
   among cART-treated men (rate ratios {[}RRs] = 18.91, 95\% CI = 8.50 to
   42.09, for CD4 level category < 200 cells per cubic millimeter; RR =
   3.55, 95\% CI = 1.40 to 9.00, for 200-349 cells per cubic millimeter;
   and RR = 4.11, 95\% CI = 1.74 to 9.70, for 350-499 cells per cubic
   millimeter; all compared with >= 500 cells per cubic millimeter). After
   adjustment for current CD4 cell count, HIV infection duration, age, or
   nadir CD4 cell count was not associated with Kaposi sarcoma incidence.
   Among cART-treated HIV-infected homosexual men, current CD4 cell count
   was the factor most strongly associated with the incidence of Kaposi
   sarcoma. Survival estimates after Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis have improved
   over time.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Ukraine has the second largest European HIV epidemic. This study aimed
   to describe stigma, demographic and social factors and their association
   with anxiety among perinatally and behaviourally-HIV-infected (PHIV;
   BHIV) young people in Kiev and Odessa.
   Methods
   104 PHIV and 100 BHIV young people aged 13-25 years completed a
   confidential tablet-based survey. Survey tools included the Hospital
   Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (anxiety sub-scale scores of 8-10
   indicating mild and >= 11 moderate/severe symptoms in last 7 days),
   Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and HIV Stigma Scale (HSS) (short
   version, composite of disclosure, negative self-image and public
   attitudes sub-scales). Unadjusted Poisson regression models were fitted
   to explore factors associated with moderate/severe anxiety symptoms.
   Results
   PHIV and BHIV young people were of median age 15.5 {[}IQR 13.9-17.1] and
   23.0 {[}21.0-24.3] years, having registered for HIV care a median 12.3
   {[}10.3-14.4] and 0.9 {[}0.2-2.4] years previously; 97\% (97/100) and
   66\% (65/99) respectively were on ART. Overall 43\% (95\% CI 36-50\%)
   reported any and 13\% (95\% CI 9-19\%) moderate/severe anxiety symptoms,
   with no difference by HIV acquisition mode (p = 0.405) or gender (p =
   0.700). 42\% (75/180) reported history of an emotional health problem
   for which they had not been referred/attended for care. Moderate/severe
   anxiety symptoms were associated with HIV-related stigma (prevalence
   ratio (PR) 1.24 95\% CI 1.14-1.34 per HSS unit increase), lower
   self-esteem (PR 0.83 95\% CI 0.78-0.90 per RSES point increase), CD4 <=
   350 cells/mm(3) (PR 2.29 95\% CI 1.06-4.97), having no-one at home who
   knew the respondent's HIV status (PR 9.15 95\% CI 3.40-24.66 vs all
   know) and, among BHIV, less stable living situation (PR 6.83 95\% CI
   1.99-23.48 for >= 2 vs no home moves in last 3 years) and history of
   drug use (PR 4.65 95\% CI 1.83-11.85).
   Conclusions
   Results indicated unmet need for psychosocial support. Further work is
   needed to explore strategies for mental health support, particularly
   around disclosure, self-esteem and stigma.}},

Abstract = {{Time-resolved photoion and photoclectron velocity mapped images from NO2
   excited close to its first dissociation limit {[}to NO(X-2 Pi) +
   O(P-3(2))] have been recorded in a two colour pump-probe experiment,
   using the frequency-doubled and frequency-tripled output of a
   regeneratively amplified titanium-sapphire laser. At least three
   processes are responsible for the observed transient signals; a negative
   pump-probe signal (corresponding to a 266 nm pump), a very short-lived
   transient close to the cross-correlation of the pump and probe pulses
   but on the 400 nm pump side, and a longer-lived positive pump-probe
   signal that exhibits a signature of wavepacket motion (oscillations).
   These transients have two main origins; multiphoton excitation of the
   Rydberg states of NO2 by both 266 and 400 nm light, and electronic
   relaxation in the 1(2)B(2) state of NO2, which leads to a
   quasi-dissociaied NO2 high in the 1(2)A(1) electronic ground state and
   just below the dissociation threshold. The wavepacket motion that we
   observe is ascribed to states exhibiting free rotation of the O atom
   about the NO moiety. These states, which are common for loosely bound
   systems such as a van der Waals complex but unusual for a
   chemically-bound molecule, have previously been observed in the
   frequency domain by optical double resonance spectroscopy but never
   before in the time domain.}},

Abstract = {{We have measured the count probability distribution function (CPDF) in a
   series of 10 volume-limited sub-samples of a deep redshift survey of
   IRAS galaxies. The CPDF deviates significantly from both the Poisson and
   Gaussian limits in all but the largest volumes. We derive the
   volume-averaged 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5 point correlation functions from the
   moments of the CPDF and find them all to be reasonably well described by
   power laws. Weak systematic effects with the sample size provide
   evidence for stronger clustering of galaxies of higher luminosity on
   small scales. Nevertheless, remarkably tight relationships hold between
   the correlation functions of different order. In particular, the
   `'normalized'' skewness defined by the ratio S3 = xi3BAR/xi2(2)BAR
   varies at most weakly with scale in the range 0.1 < xi2BAR < 10. That
   is, S3 is close to constant (= 1.5 +/- 0.5) from weakly to strongly
   nonlinear scales. On small scales, this is consistent with previous
   determinations of the three-point correlation function zeta = xi3. On
   larger scales, this conforms with the hypothesis of the growth of
   observed structures by gravitational clustering of initially Gaussian
   density fluctuations. We similarly find that xi4BAR is proportional to
   the third power Of xi2BAR in the same range of xi2BAR, and there is weak
   evidence that xi5BAR is proportional to the fourth power of xi2BAR.
   Furthermore, we find that the void probability function obeys a scaling
   relation with density to great precision, in accord with the
   scale-invariance hypothesis (xi(N)BAR is-proportional-to xi2N-1BAR)). 
   Double-counting cluster galaxies in order to match the cluster
   overdensities seen in optically selected samples of galaxies increases
   greatly the derived value Of S3 and S4, although the scaling between the
   correlations of different orders remains. Unfortunately, the relative
   sparseness of the IRAS sample precludes using it to make the most
   demanding tests of scale invariance, which rely on the overall shape of
   the CPDF at different scales. In this sparse limit, various models for
   the CPDF become degenerate and fit the IRAS data nearly equally well.
   Indeed, the CPDF is well fitted by both the negative binomial
   distribution, and the thermodynamical model of Saslaw \& Hamilton, and
   to a somewhat lesser extent by the log-normal distribution. All three
   models fit the data poorly for the densest subsample of IRAS galaxies
   examined, but this may be more a reflection of finite volume effects
   than of the inadequacy of the models.}},

   treated without SVR), and 2503 HCVseronegative controls. After a mean
   follow-up of 8.2 years, we observed (HCV seropositive and HCV
   seronegative, respectively) 107 and 18 liver events, 41 and 14 kidney
   events, 230 and 121 osteoporosis/fractures, 82 and 94 diabetes mellitus,
   114 and 129 cardiovascular events, 119 and 147 non-AIDS malignancies,
   162 and 126 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV category B/C
   events, 106 and 10 liver-related deaths, and 227 and 218
   non-liver-related deaths. Compared with HCV-negative controls,
   HCV-seropositive participants had an increased risk of liver events
   (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR], 6.29 {[}95\% confidence interval \{CI\},
   3.52-11.22]), liver-related death (IRR, 8.24 {[}95\% CI, 3.61-18.83]),
   kidney events (IRR, 2.43 {[}95\% CI, 1.11-5.33]), and osteoporosis/
   fracture (IRR, 1.43 {[}95\% CI, 1.03-2.01]). Among HCV-seropositive
   individuals, treated participants without SVR vs those with SVR had a
   higher risk of liver events (IRR, 6.79 {[}95\% CI, 2.33-19.81]),
   liver-related death (IRR, 3.29 {[}95\% CI, 1.35-8.05]), and diabetes
   mellitus (IRR, 4.62 {[}95\% CI, 1.53-13.96]). Similar but not
   statistically significant differences were found between untreated HCV
   RNA-positive patients and those with SVR.
   Conclusions. While HCV exposure was associated with an increased risk of
   kidney disease and osteoporosis/fracture, this risk did not seem to be
   dependent of persistent HCV RNA. Successful HCV treatment was associated
   with a lower incidence of liver disease, liver-related death, and
   diabetes mellitus, whereas the other conditions studied were less
   affected.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of a flexible coarse-grained model are used to study silica
   aerogels. This model, introduced in a previous study (J. Phys. Chem. C
   2007, 111, 15792), consists of spherical particles which interact
   through weak nonbonded forces and strong interparticle bonds that may
   form and break during the simulations. Small-deformation simulations are
   used to determine the elastic moduli of a wide range of material models,
   and large-deformation simulations are used to probe structural evolution
   and plastic deformation. Uniaxial deformation at constant transverse
   pressure is simulated using two methods: a hybrid Monte Carlo approach
   combining molecular dynamics for the motion of individual particles and
   stochastic moves for transverse stress equilibration, and isothermal
   molecular dynamics simulations at fixed Poisson ratio. Reasonable
   agreement on elastic moduli is obtained except at very low densities.
   The model aerogels exhibit Poisson ratios between 0.17 and 0.24, with
   higher-density gels clustered around 0.20, and Young's moduli that vary
   with aerogel density according to a power-law dependence with an
   exponent near 3.0. These results are in agreement with reported
   experimental values. The models are shown to satisfy the expected
   homogeneous isotropic linear-elastic relationship between bulk and
   Young's moduli at higher densities, but there are systematic deviations
   at the lowest densities. Simulations of large compressive and tensile
   strains indicate that these materials display a ductile-to-brittle
   transition as the density is increased, and that the tensile strength
   varies with density according to a power law, with an exponent in
   reasonable agreement with experiment. `Auxetic behavior is observed at
   large tensile strains in some models. Finally, at maximum tensile stress
   very few broken bonds are found in the materials, in accord with the
   theory that only a small fraction of the material structure is actually
   load-bearing.}},

Title = {{Effect of roflumilast on exacerbations in patients with severe chronic

Abstract = {{Background Roflumilast reduces exacerbations in patients with severe
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Its effect in patients using
   fixed combinations of inhaled corticosteroids and longacting beta(2)
   agonists is unknown. We postulated that roflumilast would reduce
   exacerbations in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease at risk for exacerbations, even in combination with inhaled
   corticosteroid and longacting beta(2) agonist treatment.
   Methods For this 1-year double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
   group, multicentre, phase 3-4 trial, the Roflumilast and Exacerbations
   in patients receiving Appropriate Combination Therapy (REACT) study, we
   enrolled patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from
   203 centres (outpatient clinics, hospitals, specialised pulmonologists,
   and family doctors) in 21 countries. Eligible patients were 40 years of
   age or older with a smoking history of at least 20 pack-years and a
   diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with severe airflow
   limitation, symptoms of chronic bronchitis, and at least two
   exacerbations in the previous year. We used a computerised central
   randomisation system to randomly assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to the
   two treatment groups: roflumilast 500 mu g or placebo given orally once
   daily together with a fixed inhaled corticosteroid and longacting
   beta(2) agonist combination. Background tiotropium treatment was
   allowed. All patients and investigators were masked to group assignment.
   The primary outcome was the rate of moderate to severe chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations per patient per year,
   analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with
   ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT01329029.
   Findings Between April 3, 2011, and May 27, 2014, we enrolled 1945
   eligible participants and randomly assigned 973 to the roflumilast group
   and 972 to the placebo group. The rate of moderate-to-severe chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations was 13.2\% lower in the
   roflumilast group than in the placebo group according to a Poisson
   regression analysis (roflumilast 0.805 vs placebo 0.927; rate ratio
   {[}RR] 0.868 {[}95\% CI 0.753-1.002], p=0.0529), and 14.2\% lower
   according to a predefined sensitivity analysis using negative binomial
   regression (0.823 vs 0.959; 0.858 {[}0.740-0.995], p=0.0424). Adverse
   events were reported by 648 (67\%) of 968 patients receiving roflumilast
   and by 572 (59\%) of 967 patients in the placebo group; adverse
   event-associated patient withdrawal from the study was also more common
   in the roflumilast group (104/968 {[}11\%]) than in the placebo group
   (52/967 {[}5\%]). The most frequently reported serious adverse events
   were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and pneumonia,
   and 17 (1.8\%) deaths occurred in the roflumilast group compared with 18
   (1.9\%) in the placebo group.
   Interpretation Our findings suggest that roflumilast reduces
   exacerbations and hospital admissions in patients with severe chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis who are at risk of
   frequent and severe exacerbations despite inhaled corticosteroid and
   longacting beta(2) agonist therapy, even in combination with tiotropium.}},

Title = {{Molecular dynamics simulation of electro-osmotic flows in rough wall
   nanochannels}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{5, 1}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We performed equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics
   simulation to study electro-osmotic flows inside charged nanochannels
   with different types of surface roughness. We modeled surface roughness
   as a sequence of two-dimensional subnanoscale grooves and ridges (step
   function-type roughness) along the flow direction. The amplitude,
   spatial period, and symmetry of surface roughness were varied. The
   amplitude of surface roughness was on the order of the Debye length. The
   walls have uniform negative charges at the interface with fluids. We
   included only positive ions (counterions) for simplicity of computation.
   For the smooth wall, we compared our molecular dynamics simulation
   results to the well-known Poisson-Boltzmann theory. The density profiles
   of water molecules showed ``layering{''} near the wall. For the rough
   walls, the density profiles measured from the wall are similar to those
   for the smooth wall except near where the steps are located. Because of
   the layering of water molecules and the finite size effect of ions and
   the walls, the ionic distribution departs from the Boltzmann
   distribution. To further understand the structure of water molecules and
   ions, we computed the polarization density. Near the wall, its z
   component dominates the other components, indicating the preferred
   orientation ({''}ordering{''}) of water molecules. Especially, inside
   the groove for the rough walls, its maximum is 10\% higher (stronger
   ordering) than for the smooth wall. The dielectric constant, computed
   with a Clausius-Mosotti-type equation, confirmed the ordering near the
   wall and the enhanced ordering inside the groove. The residence time and
   the diffusion coefficient, computed using the velocity autocorrelation
   function, showed that the diffusion of water and ions along the
   direction normal to the wall is significantly reduced near the wall and
   further decreases inside the groove. Along the flow direction, the
   diffusion of water and ions inside the groove is significantly lowered
   while it is similar to the bulk value elsewhere. We performed
   nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation to compute electro-osmotic
   velocities and flow rates. The velocity profiles correspond to those for
   overlapped electric double layers. For the rough walls, velocity inside
   the groove is close to zero, meaning that the channel height is
   effectively reduced. The flow rate was found to decrease as the period
   of surface roughness decreases or the amplitude of surface roughness
   increases. We defined the zeta potential as the electrostatic potential
   at the location of a slip plane. We computed the electrostatic potential
   with the ionic distribution and the dielectric constant both from our
   molecular dynamics simulation. We estimated the slip plane from the
   velocity profile. The zeta potential showed the same trend as the flow
   rate: it decreases with an increasing amplitude and a decreasing period
   of surface roughness.}},

Title = {{Motor impairments in transient ischemic attack increase the odds of a

Journal = {{RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{37}},

Pages = {{509-521}},
Abstract = {{Background: Unilateral motor impairment is a key symptom used in the
   diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA). Diffusion-weighted imaging
   (DWI) is a promising diagnostic tool for detecting ischemic lesions.
   While both motor impairments and DWI abnormalities are linked to the
   diagnosis of TIA, the association between these prognostic factors is
   not well understood.
   Objective: To examine the association between unilateral motor
   impairments and the odds of a positive DWI in TIA. Further, to determine
   whether the time between symptom onset and neuroimaging (delay to scan)
   influences the odds of a positive DWI.
   Methods: We used PRISMA guidelines to conduct a systematic search from
   1989 to 2018. We included studies that reported number of individuals
   with/without unilateral motor symptoms and a positive/negative DWI.
   Results: Twenty-four studies from North America, Australia, Asia, and
   Europe were submitted to a meta-analysis. A pooled odds ratio of 1.80
   (95\% CI, 1.45-2.24, p = 0.00; I-2 = 57.38) suggested that the odds of a
   positive DWI are greater in TIA individuals who experience motor
   symptoms as compared with those who experience no motor symptoms.
   Further, increasing the time delay to scan from the symptom onset (>2
   days) did not influence the odds of a positive DWI as compared with an
   earlier scan (<= 2 days).
   Conclusions: The current meta-analysis provides cumulative evidence from
   6710 individuals with TIA that the presence of motor symptoms increases
   the odds of a positive DWI by two-folds. These findings transform the
   clinical perception into evidence-based knowledge that motor impairments
   elevate the risk for brain tissue damage. Unilateral motor impairments
   in a cerebrovascular event should increase a physician's suspicion of
   detecting brain infarctions. These findings may influence the clinical
   management of TIA by generating faster response to motor impairments in
   TIA and accelerating referral to specialized stroke clinic.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, metal additive manufacturing (AM) are widely employed
   for industrial applications, such as: biomedical, aerospace, automotive,
   marine and offshore sections. AM demonstrated superior manufacturing
   efficiencies and economic advantages for advanced lightweight industrial
   components with unlimited arbitrary topological layouts and complex
   internal microstructures, and are also employed for fabrication of
   auxetic materials and structures. In this paper, damage
   characterizations and mechanical behaviors of selective laser melting
   (SLM) fabricated 3D re-entrant lattices are investigated based on
   in-situ interrupted micro-CT test, and simulation based on geometric
   reconstructed models are performed for exploring the underlying failure
   mechanisms. Firstly, theoretical models for predicting the mechanical
   properties of 3D re-entrant lattice are developed, such as stiffness,
   Poisson's ratio and strength, etc. Secondly, the geometrical errors and
   fabrication defects of 3D reentrant lattices are analyzed based on 3D
   micro-CT scanning, in-situ micro-CT interrupted compression tests are
   performed for studying the deformation process and failure mechanisms.
   Finally, image finite element models with the detailed information of
   the shape, position and distribution of defects of the 3D reentrant
   lattices are constructed from 3D tomographic images, and numerical
   simulations are performed for studying the effects of the defects on the
   mechanical performances of the SLM additive manufactured 3D re-entrant
   lattice structures. It is shown that the failure behavior of the
   reentrant lattice is governed not only by its topology, but also by the
   geometric defects and surface defects. Moreover, the proposed
   interrupted in-situ micro-CT mechanical loading experiments and image
   finite element approaches can also shed lights on the relations between
   fracture failure around the edge and the powder adhesion. The damage
   evolution process is compared with the numerical simulation results to

Abstract = {{Polyriboadenylates of alkali metals were obtained from (1) K+-poly (A)
   (salts I) and (2) H+-poly (A) (salts II) by the ion-exchange method. The
   conductivity of these salts as well as of H+-poly (A) were studied.
   Salts I and II of the same counterion were shown to have significantly
   different conductivity coefficients (f) and polyion conductances
   (lambda-p(o)). The charge density parameter (xi) was 1.3 and 2.5,
   respectively, with lambda-p(o) equal to 44 and 83 ohm-1 cm2 mole-1 for
   poly (A)-I and poly (A)-II salts, respectively. This is credited to the
   difference in the conformations of corresponding polyions. The linear
   dependence of equivalent conductivity on the square root of polymer
   concentration (Kohlrausch coordinates), earlier obtained for DNA, is
   also satisfied for the studied polynucleotides. A comparison of the
   slopes of straight lines in Kohlrausch coordinates for poly (A), simple
   electrolytes, and for earlier studied polyribouridylic acid salts lends
   credence to the concepts, developed by a number of authors, that DNA can
   act as a ``buffer{''} against the ion-ion interaction in concentrated
   electrolyte solutions. Using the approximation that the polyion
   conductance is independent of the counterion nature, parameter f
   (agreeing in this case with Eisenberg parameter-phi) has been shown to
   decrease as the polynucleotide concentration is increased; the decrease
   is caused by the relaxation effect. The transference numbers of
   counterions, which have negative values in poly (A)-II solutions, grow
   with the increase in polymer concentration; the higher the xi, the more
   apparent is this increase. This is explained by the increase in the
   fraction of conductivity along the polyion chains ({''}surface{''}
   conductivity) with the growth of polyelectrolyte concentration.}},

Title = {{Multifractal Analysis for Images: The wavelet Leaders contribution}},
Journal = {{TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{47-65}},
Abstract = {{1. Motivation
   Scale invariance has been observed in numerous applications involving
   data of various and very different natures. It can be operationally
   defined as the power law behavior with respect to scale of the structure
   functions, which are given by the empirical moments of the absolute
   value of the multiresolution coefficients of the data at a given scale
   (cf. Eq. (1)). The estimation of the exponents characterizing these
   power laws - termed scaling exponents - constitutes the ultimate goal of
   the practical analysis of scale invariance (also called scaling
   analysis). These scaling exponents are then commonly involved in
   standard signal processing tasks, such as detection, identification, or
   classification. In practice, scaling analysis is often conducted within
   the theoretical framework of multifractal analysis.
   In a nutshell, multifractal analysis aims at characterizing the
   fluctuation (in time or space) of the local regularity of the process
   under analysis through analysis of the (power law) behavior of the
   structure functions in the limit of fine scales, Though multifractal
   analysis can theoretically be extended to dimensions higher than 1
   without technical difficulties, most practical implementations remain
   restricted to one dimensional signals. This is mainly due to the fact
   that multifractal analysis requires the use of a range of both positive
   and negative empirical moments, hence demanding for multiresolution
   quantities with adequate properties. To date, the only practically
   available procedure for the multifractal analysis of 2D signals, hence
   images, is the so called Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM)
   procedure (based on the skeleton of a continuous wavelet transform
   (CWT)). Yet, the WTMM procedure suffers from a number of theoretical and
   practical drawbacks: It has a high computational cost; The calculation
   of the 2D CWT skeleton requires involved theoretical definitions as well
   as a cumbersome practical procedure; It is still lacking a theoretical
   support. Therefore, in numerous applications where the data are
   naturally images, multifractal analysis remains restricted to 1D slices
   of the data and hence incomplete.
   In the present contribution, elaborating on previous results obtained
   for (1D) signals, we propose a practical multifractal analysis method
   for (2D) images based on two key features: The use of a 2D Discrete
   Wavelet Transform (DWT) (instead of a 2D CWT); The replacement of
   wavelet coefficients with wavelet Leaders. This yields two major
   benefits:
   The computation cost is very low; Wavelet Leaders have been shown to
   yield a complete and rigorous analysis of the multifractal analysis of
   bounded functions. This is because wavelet Leaders consist of monotonous
   increasing quantities that finely account for the irregularities of the
   analyzed function. The aims of the present contribution are twofold:
   First, studying the necessary theoretical elements, validity and
   limitations of a wavelet Leader based multifractal analysis of images,
   and second, the evaluation of its practical statistical performance.
   2. Multifractal Analysis: Theory
   Multifractal analysis of a bounded function consists of describing the
   fluctuation of its local regularity with respect to space.
   The local regularity is measured by the Holder exponent. The variability
   of the Holder exponents with respect to space is characterized by the
   multifractal spectrum. It is defined as the Hausdorff dimension of the
   ensemble of points at which the function has the same Holder exponent.
   Practical multifractal analysis essentially aims at obtaining the
   multifractal spectrum from a single finite size image. The corresponding
   theoretical elements are given in Section 2.1. Since the multifractal
   spectrum is numerically not directly accessible, so-called multifractal
   formalisms have to be used: They recast the estimation to quantities
   that can actually be numerically calculated in practice and allow -
   under certain mathematical hypotheses - the estimation of the
   multifractal spectrum, For functions that are uniform Holder (i.e.,
   functions whose minimal regularity exponent, as defined in Eqs. (3) and
   (4), is positive), it has been shown that the wavelet Leaders locally
   reproduce the Holder exponent through a power law behavior in the limit
   of fine scales. They should hence constitute the key ingredient for the
   wavelet Leader multifractal formalism for images. Wavelet Leaders are
   defined as the supremum of the coefficients of a discrete wavelet
   transform in a small (time or space) neighborhood over all finer scales.
   First, the wavelet Leader structure functions are calculated from the
   image, both for positive and negative moments, and the corresponding
   scaling exponents are estimated. By taking their Legendre transform, one
   obtains the Legendre spectrum. The multifractal formalism consists now
   of stating that the Legendre spectrum is identical with the multifractal
   spectrum. This is described in Section 2.2. A practical procedure to
   measure the minimal regularity exponent is given in Eq. (5).
   This interpretation of the Legendre spectrum as the multifractal
   spectrum of the image is however not of general validity. Yet, it has
   been proven to be valid for self-similar finite variance stationary
   increments processes, and is conjectured for multiplicative martingale
   based processes. Also, it has be shown that the Legendre spectrum is
   independent of the choice of the mother wavelet, and hence provides an
   intrinsic characterization of the data, regardless of its
   interpretation. It is shown in Section 2.3 that the multifractal
   formalism holds without further hypothesis only for monofractal
   processes, i.e., when both the Legendre and multifractal spectra reduce
   to a point. Also, it is shown that one can always construct a process
   with any admissible Legendre spectrum, whose multifractal and Legendre
   spectra do not coincide.
   3. Positive measures and tractional integration
   Numerical images can naturally be modeled with positive measures. This
   violates the uniform Holder assumptions, and the wavelet Leader
   multifractal formalism can not be directly applied: Theoretically,
   wavelet Leaders become infinite; In practice, they are always finite,
   yet their use would yield meaningless results.
   This difficulty can be related to the existence of negative Holder
   exponents in the data (explicit definition detailed in Section 3.1). It
   is shown that performing a fractional integration of the data, with an
   order larger than the opposite of the minimal regularity exponent,
   guarantees uniform Holder regularity, and hence that the wavelet Leader
   based multifractal formalism can be applied, It is also explained in
   Section 3.1 how fractional integration and wavelet Leaders can be merged
   into a single computationally inexpensive and numerically unproblematic
   operation, referred to as pseudo-fractional integration. The question
   that arises naturally, though, is in how far the Legendre spectrum
   obtained by this practical solution can be related to the original
   image. It is argued here that even when the multifractal formalism holds
   for the integrated image, the common heuristic association with a
   translated (by the order of integration) version of the Legendre
   spectrum can not, in general be interpreted as the spectrum of the
   image, since the image is not uniform Holder, Yet, if the image contains
   only cusp-type singularities, the Legendre spectrum is nevertheless
   intrinsically related to the original image, thus characterizes it
   precisely, and can be used as such.
   However, it is shown and discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 that if the
   image contains oscillating singularities, this reasoning is not valid:
   fractionally integrating with different orders and translating the
   Legendre spectra does not define one unique function. It is argued here
   that this fact can potentially be exploited for detecting the presence
   of oscillating singularities in data.
   4. Empirical Multifractal Analysis
   In practice, scaling analysis amounts to estimating scaling exponents.
   However, their estimation is often advantageously replaced by the
   estimation of a smaller set of specific parameters, termed the
   log-cumulants. Section 4.1 states how these log-cumulants can be used to
   approximate the Legendre spectrum with only a small number of
   parameters, and without having to calculate the Legendre transform
   numerically.
   In Sections 4.2 and 4.3, explicit forms of the wavelet coefficient and
   Leader based estimation procedures for multifractal analysis of images
   are given.
   In Section 4.4, the use of wavelet coefficients and wavelet Leaders for
   multifractal analysis are compared.
   5. Numerical Simulations
   Finally, the performance of the practical wavelet Leader based
   multifractal attribute estimation procedures for images are studied
   numerically, by means of Monte Carlo simulations conducted on two
   reference stochastic processes, whose multifractal properties are
   theoretically known: 2D fractional Brownian motions, Gaussian
   self-similar hence monofractal processes; Mandelbrot's multiplicative
   cascades (or martingales), celebrated examples of multifractal processes
   (with both log-normal and log Poisson multipliers). These processes are
   defined in Section 5.1.
   Simulation parameters are chosen to match realistic values observed in a
   number of real world data and situations (cf. Section 5.2),
   6. Estimation Performance
   From a large number (1000) of 2D realizations of fractional Brownian
   motion, and of Mandelbrot's multiplicative cascades, the estimation
   performance of the wavelet coefficient and wavelet Leader based
   multifractal formalisms are measured in terms of biases, variances and
   mean squared error. The results demonstrate that the proposed wavelet
   Leader based procedures outperform those based on wavelet coefficients,
   while obtained at the same computational cost, in estimation
   performance: Whereas the former enable the relevant estimation of
   scaling exponents for both positive and negative statistical orders, and
   hence of the entire spectrum, that latter fail for negative statistical
   orders and hence the right part of the spectrum (cf. Section 6.1).
   Also, the former have significantly better performance for the
   estimation of the log-cumulants, in particular for cumulants of order
   larger than 1, i.e., for cumulants that enable practitioners to
   discriminate between finite variance self similar processes and
   multiplicative cascades (cf, Section 6.2).
   Yet, there is a price to pay for such improvements: First, the scales
   that can be involved in the estimations are slightly restricted when
   using wavelet Leaders (cf. Section 6.3), and second, the variance of
   Leader based estimates of the self-similarity parameter of Gaussian self
   similar processes is not independent of the parameter, as is the case
   for coefficient based estimates (cf. Section 6.4).
   Section 6.5 illustrates the behavior of the wavelet Leader based
   multifractal analysis procedure on a real-world image, consisting of
   natural fern, chosen in reference to the classical simulated fern
   example used as a paradigm fractal object.
   7. Conclusion and discussion
   This contribution proposes the definition of a wavelet Leader
   multifractal analysis procedure for 2D signals, i.e., for Images, It is
   shown to have estimation performance that significantly outperform those
   obtained form wavelet coefficients and to have both a low computational
   cost and a low level in implementation difficulty. No other procedure
   combining this high performance level and low computational and
   conceptual difficulty levels has been proposed so far. Multifractal
   analysis consists of a conceptually involved characterization of an
   image: It relates, via the so-called multifractal formalism, the scale
   invariance properties of the data to their sample path regularity
   properties. The exact use of this theoretical framework may turn
   practically difficult. However, this does not prevent practitioners from
   using a set of estimated multifractal attributes as relevant image
   features. This contribution hence opens the route towards a systematic
   use of multifractal analysis for image detection and classification
   tasks, as is tentatively experimented in various applications (e.g.,
   computer vision).}},

Abstract = {{Background People remain at risk of reinfection with hepatitis C virus
   (HCV), even after clearance of the primary infection. We identified
   factors associated with HCV reinfection risk in a large population-based
   cohort study in British Columbia, Canada, and examined the association
   of opioid substitution therapy and mental health counselling with
   reinfection.
   Methods We obtained data from the British Columbia Hepatitis Testers
   Cohort, which includes all individuals tested for HCV or HIV at the
   British Columbia Centre for Disease Control Public Health Laboratory
   during 1990-2013 (when data were available). We defined cases of HCV
   reinfection as individuals with a positive HCV PCR test after either
   spontaneous clearance (two consecutive negative HCV PCR tests spaced >=
   28 days apart without treatment) or a sustained virological response
   (SVR; two consecutive negative HCV PCR tests spaced >= 28 days apart 12
   weeks after completing interferon-based treatment). We calculated
   incidence rates of HCV reinfection (per 100 person-years of follow-up)
   and corresponding 95\% CIs assuming a Poisson distribution, and used a
   multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to examine reinfection risk
   factors (age, birth cohort, sex, year of HCV diagnosis, HCV clearance
   type, HIV co-infection, number of mental health counselling visits,
   levels of material and social deprivation, and alcohol and injection
   drug use), and the association of opioid substitution therapy and mental
   health counselling with HCV reinfection among people who inject drugs
   (PWID).
   Findings 5915 individuals with HCV were included in this study after
   clearance (3690 after spontaneous clearance and 2225 after SVR). 452
   (8\%) patients developed reinfection; 402 (11\%) after spontaneous
   clearance and 50 (2\%) who had achieved SVR. Individuals were followed
   up for a median of 5.4 years (IQR 2.9-8.7), and the median time to
   reinfection was 3 . 0 years (1.5-5.4). The overall incidence rate of
   reinfection was 1 . 27 (95\% CI 1.15-1.39) per 100 person-years of
   follow-up over a total of 35 672 person-years, with significantly higher
   rates in the spontaneous clearance group (1.59, 1.44-1.76) than in the
   SVR group (0.48, 0.36-0.63). With the adjusted Cox proportional hazards
   model, we noted higher reinfection risks in the spontaneous clearance
   group (adjusted hazard ratio {[}HR] 2.71, 95\% CI 2.00-3.68),
   individuals co-infected with HIV (2.25, 1.78-2.85), and PWID (1.53,
   1.21-1.92) than with other reinfection risk factors. Among the 1604 PWID
   with a current history of injection drug use, opioid substitution
   therapy was significantly associated with a lower risk of reinfection
   (adjusted HR 0.73, 95\% CI 0.54-0.98), as was engagement with mental
   health counselling services (0.71, 0.54-0.92).
   Interpretation The incidence of HCV reinfection was higher among HIV
   co-infected individuals, those who spontaneously cleared HCV infection,
   and PWID. HCV treatment complemented with opioid substitution therapy
   and mental health counselling could reduce HCV reinfection risk among
   PWID. These findings support policies of post-clearance follow-up of
   PWID, and provision of harm-reduction services to minimise HCV
   reinfection and transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Background The value of quantitative interferon-gamma release assay
   results for predicting progression from Mycobacterium tuberculosis
   infection to active disease is unknown. We aimed to investigate the
   relation between QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) conversion
   interferon-gamma values and risk of subsequent active tuberculosis
   disease and of QFT reversion.
   Methods We analysed data from a reported vaccine efficacy trial of the
   tuberculosis vaccine MVA85A in South Africa. QFT negative, HIV
   uninfected young children aged 18-24 weeks were enrolled. We stratified
   participants by quantitative QFT result (interferon-gamma < 0.35 IU/mL,
   0.35-4.00 IU/mL, and > 4.00 IU/mL) at the intermediate study visit (day
   336) and determined risk of progression to active tuberculosis disease
   over the subsequent 6-24 months. No QFT differences were observed
   between placebo and MVA85A groups at day 336 or end of study; therefore,
   both groups were included in analyses. Study clinicians were not masked
   to QFT values, but strict case definitions were used that excluded QFT
   results. We used generalised additive models to evaluate the
   quantitative relation between day 336 QFT value and subsequent disease
   risk, and we compared disease rates between QFT strata using a
   two-sample Poisson test.
   Findings Among 2512 young children with QFT tests done at day 336, 172
   (7\%) were positive; 87 (7\%) of 1267 in placebo group and 85 (7\%) of
   1245 in the MVA85A group (p=1.00). Compared with QFT non-converters
   (tuberculosis disease incidence 0.7 per 100 person-years {[}95\% CI
   0.4-1.1]), children with QFT conversion at interferon-gamma values
   between 0.35-4.00 IU/mL did not have significantly increased risk of
   disease (2.5 per 100 person-years {[}95\% CI 0.4-9.4]; incidence rate
   ratio (IRR) 3.7 (95\% CI 0.4-15.8; p=0.23). However, QFT conversion at
   interferon-gamma values higher than 4.00 IU/mL was associated with
   substantially increased disease incidence (28.0 per 100 person-years
   {[}95\% CI 14.9-45.7]) compared with non-converters (IRR 42.5 {[}95\% CI
   17.2- 99.7]; p < 0.0001), and compared with children with
   interferon-gamma values between 0.35-4.00 IU/mL (IRR 11.4 {[}95\% CI
   2.4-107.2]; p=0.00047). Among 91 QFT converters who were given a repeat
   test, 53 (58\%) reverted from positive to negative. QFT reversion risk
   was inversely associated with interferon-gamma value at QFT conversion
   and was highest with interferon-gamma values less than 4.00 IU/mL (47
   {[}77\%] of 61).
   Interpretation In young children, tuberculosis disease risk was not
   significantly increased, and QFT reversion was common, following QFT
   conversion at interferon-gamma values up to 10 times the recommended
   test threshold (0.35 IU/mL). By contrast, QFT conversion at very high
   interferon-gamma values (> 4.00 IU/mL) warrants intensified diagnostic
   and preventive intervention because of the extremely high risk of
   tuberculosis disease in these young children.

Title = {{Modelling the number of antenatal care visits in Bangladesh to determine
   the risk factors for reduced antenatal care attendance}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{The existence of excess zeros in the distribution of antenatal care
   (ANC) visits in Bangladesh raises the research question of whether there
   are two separate generating processes in taking ANC and the frequency of
   ANC. Thus the main objective of this study is to identify a proper count
   regression model for the number of ANC visits by pregnant women in
   Bangladesh covering the issues of overdispersion, zero-inflation, and
   intra-cluster correlation with an additional objective of determining
   risk factors for ANC use and its frequency. The data have been extracted
   from the nationally representative 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and
   Health Survey, where 22\% of the total 4493 women did not take any ANC
   during pregnancy. Since these zero ANC visits can be either structural
   or sampling zeros, two-part zero-inflated and hurdle regression models
   are investigated along with the standard one-part count regression
   models. Correlation among response values has been accounted for by
   incorporating cluster-specific random effects in the models. The hurdle
   negative binomial regression model with cluster-specific random
   intercepts in both the zero and the count part is found to be the best
   model according to various diagnostic tools including likelihood ratio
   and uniformity tests. The results show that women who have poor
   education, live in poor households, have less access to mass media, or
   belong to the Sylhet and Chittagong regions are less likely to use ANC
   and also have fewer ANC visits. Additionally, women who live in rural
   areas, depend on family members' decisions to take health care, and have
   unintended pregnancies had fewer ANC visits. The findings recommend
   taking both cluster-specific random effects and overdispersion and
   zero-inflation into account in modelling the ANC data of Bangladesh.
   Moreover, safe motherhood programmes still need to pay particular
   attention to disadvantaged and vulnerable subgroups of women.}},

Abstract = {{We have measured the carbon isotopic composition of particulate organic

   attempt to further document the pattern and causes of covariance between
   POC-deltaC-13 and {[}CO2aq], we concurrently measured surface water
   pCO2, temperature, salinity, nitrate concentration, POM concentration,
   chlorophyll a and the deltaC-13 of total dissolved inorganic carbon.
   While we found the previously reported general negative correlation
   between POC-deltaC-13 and {[}CO2aq], we also observed a prominent
   maximum in POC-deltaC-13 in the region immediately north of the
   Subtropical Convergence, coinciding with a maximum in {[}POM] and
   chlorophyll a, and with a minimum in pCO2. The increase in POC-deltaC-13
   between 59-degrees-S and die Subtropical Convergence is consistent with
   the trend expected if {[}CO2aq] were the main factor controlling the
   isotopic composition of POM. In contrast, data from the region north of
   the Subtropical Convergence clearly illustrate that POC-deltaC-13 can
   also vary independently of {[}CO2aq], as a 5 per mil decrease in
   POC-deltaC-13 was found in a region characterized by nearly constant
   {[}CO2aq]. We review several physiological factors which may account for
   these observations and discuss their implications for paleoceanographic
   reconstruction of {[}CO2aq] from the carbon isotopic composition of

Title = {{Fluctuations in the incidence of type 1 diabetes in the United States
   from 2001 to 2015: a longitudinal study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: While the United States has the largest number of children
   with type 1 diabetes mellitus, less is known regarding adult-onset
   disease. The present study utilizes nationwide data to compare the
   incidence of type 1 diabetes in youth (0-19 years) to that of adults
   (20-64 years).
   Methods: In this longitudinal study, the Clinformatics (R) Data Mart
   Database was used, which contains information from 61 million
   commercially insured Americans (years 2001-2015). Incidence rates and
   exact Poisson 95\% confidence intervals were calculated by age group,
   sex, census division, and year of diagnosis. Changes in rates over time
   were assessed by negative binomial regression.
   Results: Overall, there were 32,476 individuals who developed type 1
   diabetes in the cohort. The incidence rate was greatest in youth aged
   10-14 years (45.5 cases/100,000 person-years); however, because
   adulthood spans over a longer period than childhood, there was a greater
   number of new cases in adults than in youth (n = 19,174 adults; n =
   13,302 youth). Predominance in males was evident by age 10 and persisted
   throughout adulthood. The male to female incidence rate ratio was 1.32
   (95\% CI 1.30-1.35). The incidence rate of type 1 diabetes in youth
   increased by 1.9\% annually from 2001 to 2015 (95\% CI 1.1-2.7\%; P <
   0.001), but there was variation across regions. The greatest increases
   were in the East South Central (3.8\%/year; 95\% CI 2.0-5.6\%; P <
   0.001) and Mountain divisions (3.1\%/year; 95\% CI 1.6-4.6\%; P <
   0.001). There were also increases in the East North Central (2.7\%/year;
   P = 0.010), South Atlantic (2.4\%/year; P < 0.001), and West North
   Central divisions (2.4\%/year; P < 0.001). In adults, however, the
   incidence decreased from 2001 to 2015 (-1.3\%/year; 95\% CI -2.3\% to
   -0.4\%; P = 0.007). Greater percentages of cases were diagnosed in
   January, July, and August for both youth and adults. The number of new
   cases of type 1 diabetes (ages 0-64 years) in the United States is
   estimated at 64,000 annually (27,000 cases in youth and 37,000 cases in
   adults).
   Conclusions: There are more new cases of type 1 diabetes occurring
   annually in the United States than previously recognized. The increase
   in incidence rates in youth, but not adults, suggests that the
   precipitating factors of youth-onset disease may differ from those of
   adult-onset disease.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this research was to estimate heritabilities of
   seven osteochondrosis (OC) lesions in station-tested pigs and their
   genetic and phenotypic correlations with four meat quality (MQ) traits,
   the percentage of premium cuts (PPC), daily weight gain (DWG), and feed
   conversion ratio (FCR). Observed OC lesions were on the head of humerus
   (HK), condylus medialis humeri (CMH), condylus lateralis humeri (CLH),
   radius and ulna proximal (RUP), distal epiphyseal cartilage of ulna
   (DEU), head of femur (FK), and condylus medialis femoris (CMF). Meat
   quality traits were i.m. fat (IMF), muscle pH at 1 h after slaughter
   (pH1), muscle pH at 30 h after slaughter (pH30), and light reflectance
   on muscle (H30). The data set comprised 2,710 animals, of which 1,291
   animals had OC records. All traits were analyzed by multiple-trait
   linear mixed model, with the animal's genetic and common litter effects
   as random. Fixed effects in the model varied between traits. Each OC
   lesion was further analyzed by a univariate generalized linear mixed
   model or, equivalently, ``threshold models,{''} assuming logistic,
   probit (normal), and Poisson distributions of the underlying
   ``liability{''} to the disease. For OC lesions, estimates of
   heritability were low on the original ``incidence{''} scale (0.06 for HK
   to 0.16 for CLH) and moderate to high on the liability scale (0.08 to
   0.42). Genetic correlations (r(g)) between OC lesions and most MQ traits
   and PPC were generally unfavorable. Significant rg were -0.44 for
   DWG-CMH, 0.31 for DWG-CMF, 0.40 for FCR-HK, 0.21 for PPC-CLH, 0.32 for
   PPC-RUP, 0.30 for PPC-CMF, -0.54 for pH1-CLH, 0.47 for pH1-DEU, -0.34
   for pH30-CMH, 0.58 for pH30-DEU, -0.50 for H30-HK, -0.31 for H30-DEU,
   and 0.31 for H30-CMF. Genetic susceptibilities to some OC lesions within
   the front leg were positively related to each other (r(g) range = 0.57
   to 0.69), but r(g) between front and hind leg OC lesions were mostly
   negative (range = -0.21 to -0.40). Estimated h(2) was 0.60 for PPC, and
   ranged from 0.12 to 0.66 for MQ traits, 0.28 for DWG, and 0.42 for FCR.
   Genetic correlations among meat quality and quantity traits ranged from
   -0.66 to 0.37. This is the first study to report genetic and phenotypic
   correlations between OC lesions and several meat quality and quantity
   traits in pigs. These findings will be useful to pig industry,
   especially in designing breeding programs for robust pigs.}},

Title = {{Association Between Changes in Timing of Spring Onset and Asthma
   Hospitalization in Maryland}},
Journal = {{JAMA NETWORK OPEN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{Importance Ongoing climate change is affecting the health of communities
   across the globe. While direct consequences, including morbidity and
   mortality tied to increases in the frequency of extreme weather events,
   have received significant attention, indirect health effects,
   particularly those associated with climate change-driven disruptions in
   ecosystems, are less understood.
   Objective To investigate how ongoing changes in the timing of spring
   onset related to climate change are associated with rates of asthma
   hospitalization in Maryland.
   Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study of 29 257
   patients with asthma used general additive (quasi Poisson) and
   mixed-effect (negative binomial) models to investigate the association
   between changes in the timing of spring onset, detected using satellite
   observations, and the risk of asthma hospitalization in Maryland from
   2001 to 2012. Data analysis was conducted from January 2016 to March
   2019.
   Exposures Phenology data, derived from the National Aeronautics and
   Space Administration's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer,
   were used to calculate location-specific median dates for start of
   season from 2001 to 2012. How the start of season for a given year and
   location deviated from the long-term average was calculated and
   categorized as very early, early, normal, or late.
   Main Outcomes and Measures Daily asthma hospitalization in Maryland
   during the spring season (ie, March to May).
   Results There were 108 58 total asthma hospitalizations during the study
   period, of which 29 257 (27.0\%; 14 379 {[}49.1\%] non-Hispanic black
   patients; 17 877 {[}61.1\%] women) took place during springtime. In the
   unadjusted model, very early (incident rate ratio {[}IRR], 1.17; 95\%
   CI, 1.07-1.28) and late (IRR, 1.07; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.15) onset of spring
   were associated with increased risk of asthma hospitalization. When the
   analysis was adjusted for extreme heat events and concentrations of
   particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m, the
   risk remained significant for very early spring onset (IRR, 1.10; 95\%
   CI, 1.02-1.20) but not for late spring onset (IRR, 1.03; 95\% CI,
   0.97-1.11).
   Conclusions and Relevance These results suggest that ongoing changes in
   the timing of spring onset, which are related to climate variability and
   change, are associated with asthma hospitalization. Given the high
   burden of allergic diseases and the number of individuals sensitized to
   tree pollen, these findings serve as a wake-up call to public health and
   medical communities regarding the need to anticipate and adapt to the
   ongoing changes in the timing and severity of the spring allergy season.}},

Title = {{The Demography of Medical Malpractice Suits against Radiologists}},
Journal = {{RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{266}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{539-547}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To delimit demographic characteristics of malpractice claims
   against radiologists in the United States by sex and location and to
   note the varying percentages of favorable outcomes and award amounts to
   plaintiffs by state.
   Materials and Methods: This HIPAA-compliant study was institutional
   review board-approved. All radiologists enrolled in One-Call Medical, a
   specialized preferred provider organization, go through an initial and
   recurrent credentialing process, which records state of residence, age,
   sex, and malpractice history. For each radiologist, a record of
   unfavorable outcomes and payment awards is derived from narratives
   provided by the National Practitioner's Data Bank. All other suits are
   self-reported. Rates of malpractice claims per state were calculated
   with a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model allowing for
   differences in years at risk. Poisson regression was used to calculate
   the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for any payment as a result of a
   malpractice claim compared with the average of all 36 states, adjusted
   for sex. To determine the association of age, sex, and state with amount
   of payment, we used a general linear model assuming a gamma family
   distribution.
   Results: In August 2010, 8401 radiologists from 47 states composed
   One-Call Medical's panel. During their careers, 30.9\% (2600 of 8401)
   had been the subject of at least one malpractice claim. Median payment
   awards varied by 14-fold from Maine (\$350 000) to Colorado (\$24 105),
   while mean payments varied ninefold from Oregon (\$715 707) to Nebraska
   (\$74 373). Adjusted for age and state, radiologists in Alabama had the
   lowest rate of malpractice suits per 100 practice-years for men (0.95;
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI]; 0.73, 1.28) and women (0.70; 95\% CI:
   0.52, 0.96) compared with those in New York, who had the highest rate of
   suits for men (5.65; 95\% CI: 5.09, 6.26) and women (4.13; 95\% CI:
   3.54, 4.80). Overall, male radiologists had a higher rate of being sued
   than did their female counterparts (IRR = 1.37; 95\% CI: 1.20, 1.56).
   Conclusion: The likelihood of a radiologist being the defendant in at
   least one suit is 50\% by age 60, yet the difference in frequency and
   average number of suits accrued varies widely by state of residence and
   sex. Among resolved suits, the percentage of cases in which payment was
   made to the plaintiff differs markedly by state, as do median and mean
   award amount. Men are more likely than women to be sued during the
   course of their careers. (C)RSNA, 2012}},

Title = {{The incidence of diabetes mellitus and diabetic retinopathy in a
   population-based cohort study of people age 50 years and over in Nakuru,
   Kenya}},
Journal = {{BMC ENDOCRINE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{MAR 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: The epidemic rise of diabetes carries major negative public
   health and economic consequences particularly for low and middle-income
   countries. The highest predicted percentage growth in diabetes is in the
   sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region where to date there has been no data on
   the incidence of diabetic retinopathy from population-based cohort
   studies and minimal data on incident diabetes. The primary aims of this
   study were to estimate the cumulative six-year incidence of Diabetes
   Mellitus (DM) and DR (Diabetic Retinopathy), respectively, among people
   aged >= 50 years in Kenya.
   Methods: Random cluster sampling with probability proportionate to size
   were used to select a representative cross-sectional sample of adults
   aged >= 50 years in 2007-8 in Nakuru District, Kenya. A six-year follow-
   up was undertaken in 2013-14. On both occasions a comprehensive
   ophthalmic examination was performed including LogMAR visual acuity,
   digital retinal photography and independent grading of images. Data were
   collected on general health and risk factors. The primary outcomes were
   the incidence of diabetes mellitus and the incidence of diabetic
   retinopathy, which were calculated by dividing the number of events
   identified at 6-year follow- up by the number of people at risk at the
   beginning of follow-up. Age-adjusted risk ratios of the outcomes (DM and
   DR respectively) were estimated for each covariate using a Poisson
   regression model with robust error variance to allow for the clustered
   design and including inverse-probability weighting.
   Results: At baseline, 4414 participants aged >= 50 years underwent
   complete examination. Of the 4104 non-diabetic participants, 2059 were
   followed-up at six-years (50 . 2\%). The cumulative incidence of DM was
   estimated at 61 . 0 per 1000 (95\% CI: 50 . 3-73 . 7) in people aged >=
   50 years. The cumulative incidence of DR in the sample population was
   estimated at 15 . 8 per 1000 (95\% CI: 9 . 5-26 . 3) among those without
   DM at baseline, and 224 . 7 per 1000 (116.9-388.2) among participants
   with known DM at baseline. A multivariable risk factor analysis
   demonstrated increasing age and higher body mass index to be associated
   with incident DM. DR incidence was strongly associated with increasing
   age, and with higher BMI, urban dwelling and higher socioeconomic
   status. Conclusions: Diabetes Mellitus is a growing public health
   concern with a major complication of diabetic retinopathy. In a
   population of 1 . 6 million, of whom 150,000 are >= 50 years, we
   estimated that 1650 people aged >= 50 develop DM per year, and 450
   develop DR. Strengthening of health systems is necessary to reduce
   incident diabetes and its complications in this and similar settings.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Differences in the intrinsic radiosensitivity within and
   between different tumor classes have been noticed for human tumor cell
   lines using the clonogenic assay. By far, most of the cell lines studied
   up to now were derived from poorly differentiated tumors. In this study,
   the influence of tumor differentiation on the radiation doses necessary
   to control 50\% of small oxic spheroids (SCD50) was determined. Evidence
   of a distinct dependence of radioresponsiveness on tumor progression
   provides a background for an investigation of the underlying mechanisms.
   Methods and Materials: Spheroids were aggregated from 1000-1500 cells in
   agarose coated 24 multi-well plates. Their diameters ranged from 156 to
   405 mum, depending on the cell line. Spheroids were irradiated with
   graded Co-60 single doses using spheroid control as end point and a
   minimum follow-up period of 3 months.
   Results: Cell lines from three low grade gliomas and 10 malignant
   gliomas were studied in the spheroid control assay. The group mean SCD50
   values were 6.1 +/- 1.6 Gy and 13.1 +/- 3.3 Gy, respectively. Four cell
   lines from grade 2 soft tissue sarcomas had a mean SCD50 value of 6.2
   +/- 0.5 Gy and one undifferentiated sarcoma line of 11.0 Gy. Three
   well-differentiated breast cancer lines expressed the cell adhesion
   molecule E-cadherin, had an epitheloid morphology in monolayer culture,
   were estrogen receptor positive or contact inhibited in multicellular
   spheroids. Two undifferentiated breast cancer lines had a fibroblastoid
   morphology and were marker negative. The mean SCD50 value of the former
   was 10.5 +/- 1.0 Gy while that of the undifferentiated lines was 14.8
   +/- 2.8 Gy. Analysis of variance revealed a significant effect of the
   tumor type as well as the grade of dedifferentiation on the SCD50 after
   irradiation with one fraction or 2Gy/fraction. The surviving fractions
   at 2 Gy (SF2), obtained from the spheroid control rates after different
   fractionation schedules by approximation of the linear quadratic model
   assuming Poisson statistics were significantly dependent on tumor type
   (p = 0.001, ANOVA F-test) but not on tumor differentiation (p = 0.27).
   The alpha/beta ratios did not depend on tumor type (p = 0.08, ANOVA
   F-Test) but significantly increased with the grade of tumor cell
   dedifferentiation (p = 0.03).
   Conclusion: The spheroid model is suitable for measuring the
   radioresponsiveness of differentiated cell lines with very low colony
   forming efficiencies. Tumor cell differentiation is an important factor
   for the radioresponsiveness and recovery capacity of human tumor cells.}},

Title = {{Estimation of effective population size using bivariate discrete

Journal = {{LIVESTOCK SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2008}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{43-51}},

Abstract = {{Pedigree records of 72,808 animals (45,668 females and 27,140 males)
   from the genetic evaluation program of the Argentine Brangus Association
   were used to estimate effective number of founders (N(f)), effective
   number of ancestors (N(a)), and effective population size under random
   mating (N(e)) or selection (N(eS)), in order to assess genetic
   variability. The average level of completeness of the pedigree was low
   (0.17) and the average level of inbreeding (F) calculated from the
   pedigree was equal to 0.24\%. Animals in the reference population were
   21,662 calves born from 2001 to 2005. The estimated measures of
   variability were N(f)=765.7 and N(a)=387.5. The numbers of ancestors
   responsible for 100\%, 50\%, or 20\% of the genes in the reference
   group, were equal to 12,471, 273, and 22, respectively. Direct estimates
   of N(e) and N(eS) were calculated using the variances and covariances of
   family sizes, i.e. male and female progeny numbers for bulls and cows.
   Estimates of the dispersion parameters were from the Bivariate Poisson
   model for the cows, and from the Generalized Bivariate Negative Binomial
   (GBIVARNB) distribution for the bulls. The latter probability mass
   function accounted for overdispersion, a characteristic present in the
   sampling distribution of family size of bulls. The estimated variances
   of male and female progeny and the covariance between them for the bulls
   were 5.70, 271.28, and 30.15, respectively, and 1.15, 2.10, and 1.06 for
   the cows. Generation intervals (in years) were: sires of bulls-5.0,
   sires of cows=5.7, darns of bulls=4.4, and dams of cows=5.2. The
   estimated N(e) was 274, which corresponds to a rate of inbreeding (F) of
   0.18\%, whereas N(eS)=125 and F=0.40\%. As a check of the proposed
   methodology, all analyses were also performed using the pedigree records
   of 10,483 Angus animals from a herd with an average level of
   completeness of 0.68. Using the GBIVARNB model for both bulls and cows
   the estimated N(e)=95.4, thus F=0.5\% in perfect agreement with the
   calculated average inbreeding from pedigree records. Under selection,
   N(eS)=79.3 and F=0.6\%. The larger difference between estimated N(e) and
   N(eS) in the Brangus was related to the smaller bull to cow ratio in the
   breed. Therefore, it seems desirable to continue monitoring the
   effective size of the Argentine Brangus to prevent problems of
   inbreeding and lack of variability in the future. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The fertility of dairy cows has decreased dramatically worldwide over
   the last few decades, and several causes of this trend have been
   reported. Several studies have associated compromised udder health with
   deteriorating reproduction performance. Subclinical ketosis (SCK) has
   also been reported to be a risk factor for decreased conception. The
   objective of the present study was to describe how SCK might interact
   with the reported association between udder health and conception in
   dairy cows. Data from the French Milk Control Program and data on
   8,549,667 instances of artificial insemination (AI) and their
   corresponding preceding and subsequent test-days from 5,979,701 Holstein
   cows were examined over a 5-year period (2008-2012). The effect of udder
   health was evaluated through a low (L) or high (H) somatic cell count
   (SCC) before and after AI using a threshold of 200,000 cells/mL, and
   transformed into four groups (LL, LH, HI, and HH). Three proxies for
   defining SCK were proposed based on the milk fat and protein content (or
   their ratio) before AI. Statistical analysis first included a
   generalized additive model to help define the optimal threshold values.
   Next, a logistic regression with a Poisson correction was performed. On
   average, the risk of conception at first AI was reduced by 14\% for LH
   or HH cows (relative risk {[}and 95\% CI] = 0.86 10.85-0.871) when the
   SCC increased or remained high within 40 days before and after AI,
   relative to LL group. The reduction of conception success associated
   with SCK (fat and protein contents changes) varied from 3\% to 17\%
   depending on the used SCK proxy. Including the interaction term
   SCC{*}SCK clearly showed that the association of increased SCC around AI
   with conception success was modified by the presence of SCK. A cow that
   already has SCK and experiences an increase in SCC around or after AI
   exhibits up to 2 times further decrease in conception success compared
   with a cow with a high SCC and no SCK. In conclusion, this study
   reinforces the previously described association between intramammary
   inflammation around or after AI and a decreased rate of conception.
   These findings highlight how SCK interacts with the above mentioned
   relationship by strengthening the negative association between mastitis
   and conception success. In addition, the present work supports the
   theory that local inflammation may affect the whole-body response and
   alter the functions of other organs, such as the reproductive tract. (C)

Abstract = {{AIM: To investigate risk factors for injury to the superficial digital
   flexor tendon (SDFT) and suspensory apparatus (SA) of the forelimbs in
   Thoroughbred racehorses in New Zealand.
   METHODS: Poisson and negative binomial regression, with exposure time
   represented by cumulative training days for each horse, were used to
   relate explanatory variables to the incidence rate (IR) of cases of
   inflammation of the SDFT (n=51), and injuries involving the SA (n=48) in
   a population of 1,571 commercially-trained racehorses over 554,745 study
   days. Only the first occurrence of an injury for any one horse was
   eligible for inclusion. Separate analyses were run for data from horses
   in training regardless of whether they had started in a trial or race,
   and using a subset of these data restricted to those preparations
   associated with at least one start in a trial or race. Results were
   reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95\% confidence intervals
   (CI).
   RESULTS: Male horses had a higher risk of injury to the SA (IRR 2.57;
   p=0.005) and tended to have a higher risk of injury to the SDFT (IRR
   1.74; p=0.09) than female horses. Increasing age was associated with
   increased risk of injury. Horses aged 4 and >= 5 years were 6.76 (p <
   0.001) and 15.26 (p < 0.001) times more likely to incur injury to the
   SDFT, and 2.91 (p=0.02) and 3.54 (p=0.005) times more likely to incur
   injury to the SA, respectively, than 2-year-olds. Horses were more
   likely to suffer an injury to the SDFT or SA in a training preparation
   that was not associated with any starts in official trials or races
   compared with those preparations that were associated with more than one
   start (p < 0.001), and more likely to injure the SA compared with
   preparations containing one start (p=0.03). The IR of injury to the SDFT
   tended to be lower between November-January (IRR 0.78; p=0.08) and
   February-April (IRR 0.75; p=0.08) compared with August-October.
   Incidence of injury to the SDFT or SA was not associated with the
   cumulative distance raced in the last 30 days of a training preparation.
   CONCLUSION: This study identified risk factors for injury to the SDFT
   and SA in Thoroughbred racehorses in New Zealand. Injuries were more
   likely in males, older horses and in horses in training preparations
   without any starts. There was no evidence of association between injury
   and cumulative high-speed exercise.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective was to evaluate HIV prevalence and identify risk factors
   for PW infection among women attending the antenatal clinic (ANC) at a
   large public hospital in Kisumu town, western Kenya. Between June 1996
   and November 1997, in the context of a study to determine the effect of
   placental malaria on mother-to-child transmission of HN in western
   Kenya, HIV-1 antibody testing was offered to women with a singleton
   uncomplicated pregnancy of greater than or equal to 32 weeks' gestation
   attending the ANC. Women were interviewed using a structured
   questionnaire and had a fingerstick blood sample collected for
   haemoglobin (Hb), malaria smears, and HIV antibody testing.
   Overall HIV seroprevalence was 26.1\% (743/2844) (95\% confidence
   interval (CI): 24.5-27.7) and in bivariate evaluation was significantly
   associated with anaemia (Hb <11 g/dl) (risk ratio (RR) 1.8), malarial
   parasitaemia (RR 1.6), fever (axillary temperature greater than or equal
   to 37.5 degrees C at screening) (RR 1.6), a history of being treated for
   either vaginal discharge (RR 1.5) or tuberculosis (RR 1.6), reported
   alcohol consumption (RR 1.6), being an unmarried multigravida (RR 2.2)
   or a history of the most recent child having died (RR 2.0). Poisson
   regression analysis for all women identified 5 significant factors
   independently associated with HIV seropositivity: anaemia (adjusted RR
   1.7; 95\% CI 1.3-2.0), malarial parasitaemia (adjusted RR 1.7; 95\% CI
   1.4-2.0), a history of being treated for vaginal discharge (adjusted RR
   1.5; 95\% CI 1.1-2.0), fever (adjusted RR 2.0; 95\% CI 1.3-3.2) and
   reported alcohol consumption (adjusted RR 1.6; 95\% CI 1.1-2.5).
   Multigravidae women whose most recent child had died were also more
   Likely to be HIV seropositive (adjusted RR 1.9; 95\% CI 1.7-2.8). Only
   5.5\% (156/2844) of the women had none of these risk factors, of whom
   12\% (18/156) were HIV(+). Even though the model containing the 5
   identified factors fitted the data well (goodness-of-fit chi(2)=18.41,
   P=0.10), its collective capacity to predict HIV infection was poor;
   while 74\% of the truly positive women were correctly predicted positive
   by the model, 52\% of the truly negative women were misclassified.
   Among pregnant women attending the ANC in western Kenya, we were unable
   to identify a subgroup at risk of HIV infection using non-serological
   information, indicating that wherever possible universal access to
   voluntary HIV counselling and testing would be preferable to targeted
   screening.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Medications with anticholinergic and sedative effects carry
   significant risks in older people. Adverse events arising from the use
   of these medications may also lead to hospitalization and contribute to
   length of stay. The Drug Burden Index (DBI) is a tool that measures a
   person's total exposure to medications with anticholinergic and sedative
   properties, using the principles of dose response and maximal effect.
   Cumulative anticholinergic and sedative drug burden measured using the
   DBI has been associated with clinically important outcomes in older
   people. The association between the DBI and hospitalization still
   remains relatively unknown.
   Objective: The main aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship
   between DBI and hospitalization in a population-based sample of
   community-dwelling older Finns over a 1-year period.
   Methods: The health status and medication use of 339 community-dwelling
   >= 75-year-old Finns were assessed in 2004. Data on hospitalizations
   over the following year were obtained from the national discharge
   register. Two different measures were used to assess hospitalizations in
   the study sample: (i) the proportion of hospitalized participants; and
   (ii) the number of hospital days per person-year. Estimates for the
   number of hospital days per person-year and rate ratios (RRs) with 95\%
   confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Poisson or negative
   binomial regression analysis.
   Results: A total of 127 participants (38\%) were exposed to DBI
   medications; 27\% had a low DBI (>0 to <1), and 11\% had a high DBI (>=
   1). The number of hospital days per person-year was 7.9 (95\% CI 7.6,
   8.3) for the unexposed participants (DBI = 0) and 13.4 (95\% CI 12.8,
   14.1) for the exposed participants (DBI >1); the age, gender and
   co-morbidity adjusted RR of hospital days per person-year between the
   exposed and unexposed participants was 1.26 (95\% CI 1.18, 1.35).
   Between the low and high DBI groups, the difference in the number of
   hospital days per person-year was insignificant (p = 0.42). In
   multivariate analyses, the number of regularly used medications (RR =
   1.12 {[}95\% CI 1.00, 1.26] per additional medication) and the measure
   of basic activities of daily living Barthel Index (RR = 0.94 {[}95\% CI
   0.88, 0.99] per increase) were independently associated with the use of
   hospital days.
   Conclusion: Exposure to DBI medications was associated with a greater
   use of hospital days, but a cumulative dose-response relationship
   between DBI and hospitalization was not observed. The number of
   regularly used medications and functioning in the basic activities of
   daily living predicted hospital care utilization.}},

Abstract = {{Background BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 adenoviral vector vaccines
   have been rapidly rolled out in the UK from December, 2020. We aimed to
   determine the factors associated with vaccine coverage for both vaccines
   and documented the vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in
   a cohort of health-care workers undergoing regular asymptomatic testing.
   Methods The SIREN study is a prospective cohort study among staff (aged
   >= 18 years) working in publicly-funded hospitals in the UK.
   Participants were assigned into either the positive cohort (antibody
   positive or history of infection {[}indicated by previous positivity of
   antibody or PCR tests]) or the negative cohort (antibody negative with
   no previous positive test) at the beginning of the follow-up period.
   Baseline risk factors were collected at enrolment, symptom status was
   collected every 2 weeks, and vaccination status was collected through
   linkage to the National Immunisations Management System and
   questionnaires. Participants had fortnightly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR
   testing and monthly antibody testing, and all tests (including
   symptomatic testing) outside SIREN were captured. Data cutoff for this
   analysis was Feb 5, 2021. The follow-up period was Dec 7, 2020, to Feb
   5, 2021. The primary outcomes were vaccinated participants (binary ever
   vacinated variable; indicated by at least one vaccine dose recorded by
   at least one of the two vaccination data sources) for the vaccine
   coverage analysis and SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a PCR test for
   the vaccine effectiveness analysis. We did a mixed-effect logistic
   regression analysis to identify factors associated with vaccine
   coverage. We used a piecewise exponential hazard mixed-effects model
   (shared frailty-type model) using a Poisson distribution to calculate
   hazard ratios to compare time-to-infection in unvaccinated and
   vaccinated participants and estimate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine
   on all PCR-positive infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic). This
   study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN11041050, and is ongoing.
   Findings 23 324 participants from 104 sites (all in England) met the
   inclusion criteria for this analysis and were enrolled. Included
   participants had a median age of 46.1 years (IQR 36.0-54.1) and 19 692
   (84\%) were female; 8203 (35\%) were assigned to the positive cohort at
   the start of the analysis period, and 15 121 (65\%) assigned to the
   negative cohort. Total follow-up time was 2 calendar months and 1 106
   905 person-days (396 318 vaccinated and 710 587 unvaccinated). Vaccine
   coverage was 89\% on Feb 5, 2021, 94\% of whom had BNT162b2 vaccine.
   Significantly lower coverage was associated with previous infection,
   gender, age, ethnicity, job role, and Index of Multiple Deprivation
   score. During follow-up, there were 977 new infections in the
   unvaccinated cohort, an incidence density of 14 infections per 10 000
   person-days; the vaccinated cohort had 71 new infections 21 days or more
   after their first dose (incidence density of eight infections per 10 000
   person-days) and nine infections 7 days after the second dose (incidence
   density four infections per 10 000 person-days). In the unvaccinated
   cohort, 543 (56\%) participants had typical COVID-19 symptoms and 140
   (14\%) were asymptomatic on or 14 days before their PCR positive test
   date, compared with 29 (36\%) with typical COVID-19 symptoms and 15
   (19\%) asymptomatic in the vaccinated cohort. A single dose of BNT162b2
   vaccine showed vaccine effectiveness of 70\% (95\% CI 55-85) 21 days
   after first dose and 85\% (74-96) 7 days after two doses in the study
   population.
   Interpretation Our findings show that the BNT162b2 vaccine can prevent
   both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in working-age adults. This
   cohort was vaccinated when the dominant variant in circulation was
   B1.1.7 and shows effectiveness against this variant. Copyright Crown

Title = {{Targeted screening for third-generation cephalosporin-resistant
   Enterobacteriaceae carriage among patients admitted to intensive care
   units: a quasi-experimental study}},
Journal = {{CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Identification of third-generation,
   cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (3GC-RE) carriers by rectal
   screening at admission seems to be an important step in the prevention
   of transmission and outbreaks; however, little is known about its
   effectiveness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of
   `targeted screening' at patient admission to intensive care units (ICUs)
   on the incidence of 3GC-RE hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) and
   compare it to `universal screening'.
   Methods: We undertook a quasi-experimental study of two ICUs (unit A:
   intervention group; unit B: control group) at a university-affiliated
   hospital between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2011. In unit A,
   patients were screened universally for 3GC-RE at admission during period
   1 (1 January 2008 through 30 September 2010). During period 2 (2011
   calendar year), the intervention was implemented in unit A; patients
   transferred from another unit or hospital were screened selectively. In
   unit B, all patients were screened throughout periods 1 and 2.
   3GC-RE-related HAI incidence rates were expressed per 1,000
   patient-days. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were examined by multivariate
   Poisson regression modelling.
   Results: In unit A, 3GC-RE-related HAI incidence rates decreased from
   5.4 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 4.1 to 7.0) during period 1 to 1.3
   (95\% CI, 0.5 to 2.9) during period 2 (P < 0.001). No changes were
   observed in unit B between periods 1 and 2 (P = 0.5). In unit A, the
   adjusted incidence of 3GC-RE-related HAIs decreased in period 2 compared
   with period 1 (adjusted IRR, 0.3; 95\% CI, 0.1 to 0.9; P = 0.03)
   independently of temporal trend, trauma and age. No changes were seen in
   unit B (P = 0.4). The total number of rectal swabs taken showed an 85\%
   decrease in unit A between period 1 and 2 (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Targeted screening of 3GC-RE carriers at ICU admission was
   not associated with an increase in 3GC-RE-related HAI incidence compared
   with universal screening. Total number of rectal swabs decreased
   significantly. These findings suggest that targeted screening may be
   worth assessing as an alternative to universal screening.}},

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of flexible displays and the advances in smart
   materials, it is now possible to create interactive devices that are not
   only flexible but can reconfigure into any shape on demand. Several
   Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and robotics researchers have started
   designing, prototyping and evaluating shape-changing devices, realising,
   however, that this vision still requires many engineering challenges to
   be addressed. On the material science front, we need breakthroughs in
   stable and accessible materials to create novel, proof-of-concept
   devices. On the interactive devices side, we require a deeper
   appreciation for the material properties and an understanding of how
   exploiting material properties can provide affordances that unleash the
   human interactive potential. While these challenges are interesting for
   the respective research fields, we believe that the true power of
   shape-changing devices can be magnified by bringing together these
   communities. In this paper we therefore present a review of advances
   made in shape-changing materials and discuss their applications within
   an HCI context.}},

Pages = {{139-163}},

Abstract = {{The stochastic wave load environment of offshore structures is of such a
   complicated nature that any engineering analysis requires extensive
   simplifications. This concerns both the transformation of the wave field
   velocities and accelerations to forces on the structure and the
   probabilistic description of the wave field itself. In this paper the
   last issue is in focus. The modeling follows the traditional structure
   of subdividing the time development of the wind driven wave process into
   sea states within each of which the wave process is modeled as a
   stationary process. The wave process of each sea state is modeled as an
   affinity in height and time of a Gaussian process defined by a
   normalized dimensionless spectrum of Pierson-Moskowitz type. The
   affinity factors are the so-called significant wave height H-s and the
   characteristic zero upcrossing time T-z. Based on measured data of (H-s,
   T-z) from the North Sea a well fitting joint distribution of (H-s,T-z)
   is obtained as a so-called Nataf model. Since the wave field is wind
   driven, there is a correlation between the time averaged wind velocity
   pressure Q and the characteristic wave height in the stationary
   situation. Using the Poisson process model to concentrate on those load
   events that are of importance for the evaluation of the safety of the
   structure, that is, events with Q larger than some threshold q(0),
   available information about the wind velocity pressure distribution in
   high wind situations can be used to formulate a Nataf model for the
   joint conditional distribution of (H-s, T-z, Q) given that Q > q(0). The
   distribution of the largest wave height during a sea state is of
   interest for designing the free space between the sea level and the top
   side. An approximation to this distribution is well known for a Gaussian
   process and by integration over all sea states given Q > q(0), the
   distribution is obtained that is relevant for the free space design.
   However, for the forces on the members of the structure also the wave
   period is essential. Within the linear wave theory (Airy waves) the drag
   term in the Morison force formula increases by the square of the ratio
   between the wave height and the wave length, and the mass force term
   increases proportional to the ratio of the wave height and the square of
   the period. For a strongly narrow band Gaussian process Longuet-Higgins
   has derived a joint distribution of the height and the period. However,
   simulations show that the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum (or any other
   standard spectrum for wind driven sea waves of similar bandwidth such as
   the JONSWAP spectrum) does not provide a sufficiently narrow banded
   process for the distribution of Longuet-Higgins to make a good fit.
   Surprisingly it turns out that the random time L between two consecutive
   0-upcrossings and the random wave height H observed between the two
   0-upcrossings behave such that L and the ratio H/L are practically
   uncorrelated and both normally distributed except for clipping the
   negative tails. This result is of global nature and is therefore very
   difficult if not impossible to obtain by analytical mathematical
   reasoning. Finally, by combining all the derived distributional models
   into a Rosenblatt transformation, a first order reliability analysis of
   a tubular offshore platform can be made with respect to static pushover.
   Correction For non-linear wave theory can be taken into account crudely
   by using the deterministic 5th order Stokes wave in the limit state
   formulation.
   A dynamic analysis will be more complicated, of course, but the provided
   distributional information and the demonstrated modeling principles are
   judged as generally applicable. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Background Pregnant women in settings with high HIV prevalence are at
   increased risk of HIV acquisition and subsequent vertical transmission.
   We implemented and evaluated a novel programme to provide pre-exposure
   prophylaxis (PrEP) in maternal and child health clinics in Kenya.
   Methods In collaboration with Kisumu County Department of Health, we
   integrated PrEP delivery within 16 maternal and child health clinics in
   Kisumu County (Kenya). Women and girls older than 15 years seeking
   maternal and child health services who tested HIV negative at that visit
   or within a month and were willing to receive PrEP counselling were
   interviewed to assess for HIV behavioural risk factors and offered PrEP.
   Correlates of PrEP initiation and continuation were assessed using
   Poisson regression in univariate and multivariate analyses. Potential
   correlates included in our analyses were age, marital status, marriage
   type, whether pregnant or post partum, gestational age (if pregnant),
   and HIV risk factors in the previous 6 months. Reasons for the decision
   to discontinue after having decided to initiate PrEP were evaluated.
   Women who initiated PrEP were followed up 1 month, 3 months, and 6
   months after initiation.
   Findings Between Nov 20, 2017, and June 13, 2018, 9376 pregnant and
   post-partum women were assessed for behavioural risk factors and
   willingness to initiate PrEP. Overall, 2030 (21.7\%) initiated PrEP, and
   2027 had the status of their partner captured (153 {[}79.3\%] of 193
   women with partners living with HIV, 1178 {[}37.2\%] of 3165 women with
   partners of unknown HIV status, and 696 {[}11.6\%] of 5997 women with
   HIV-negative partners). Predictors of PrEP initiation in the
   multivariate analysis were: being younger than 24 years (adjusted
   prevalence ratio 1.14, 95\% CI 1.02-1.28); having a partner living with
   HIV (6.96, 5.46-8.89) or of unknown HIV status (3.08, 2.50-3.81);
   gestational age of less than 26 weeks (1.22, 1.02-1.47); having been
   diagnosed or treated for a sexually transmitted infection (1.57,
   1.20-2.06); having been forced to have sex (1.82, 1.38-2.42); having
   experienced intimate partner violence during the previous 6 months
   (1.65, 1.10-2.48); having shared needles while engaging in injection
   drug use (2.43, 1.69-3.50); and recurrent use of post-exposure
   prophylaxis (1.96, 1.36-2.82). Overall, 786 (38.7\%) of 2030 women who
   initiated PrEP continued use after the first month, with 104 (68.0\%) of
   153 women who had a partner living with HIV continuing use. Having a
   partner living with HIV was the only predictor of PrEP continuation at 1
   month in the multivariable model (1.98, 1.54-2.55). Frequent reasons for
   discontinuation were side effects and low HIV risk perception. No
   incident HIV infection was reported among women on PrEP.
   Interpretation Many women attending maternal and child health clinics
   had risk factors for HIV and elected to use PrEP, indicating that
   routinely accessed maternal and child health clinics can be an effective
   platform for PrEP delivery for young women. As PrEP awareness rises,
   PrEP provision in routine clinical settings such as maternal and child
   health facilities might contribute to decreased HIV incidence among
   young women. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Revisiting the Dependence of Poisson's Ratio on Liquid Fragility and
   Atomic Packing Density in Oxide Glasses}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio (nu) defines a material's propensity to laterally expand
   upon compression, or laterally shrink upon tension for non-auxetic
   materials. This fundamental metric has traditionally, in some fields,
   been assumed to be a material-independent constant, but it is clear that
   it varies with composition across glasses, ceramics, metals, and
   polymers. The intrinsically elastic metric has also been suggested to
   control a range of properties, even beyond the linear-elastic regime.
   Notably, metallic glasses show a striking brittle-to-ductile (BTD)
   transition for nu-values above 0.32. The BTD transition has also been
   suggested to be valid for oxide glasses, but, unfortunately, direct
   prediction of Poisson's ratio from chemical composition remains
   challenging. With the long-term goal to discover such high-nu oxide
   glasses, we here revisit whether previously proposed relationships
   between Poisson's ratio and liquid fragility (m) and atomic packing
   density (C-g) hold for oxide glasses, since this would enable m and C-g
   to be used as surrogates for nu. To do so, we have performed an
   extensive literature review and synthesized new oxide glasses within the
   zinc borate and aluminoborate families that are found to exhibit high
   Poisson's ratio values up to 0.34. We are not able to unequivocally
   confirm the universality of the Novikov-Sokolov correlation between nu
   and m and that between nu and C-g for oxide glass-formers, nor for the
   organic, ionic, chalcogenide, halogenide, or metallic glasses. Despite
   significant scatter, we do, however, observe an overall increase in nu
   with increasing m and C-g, but it is clear that additional structural
   details besides m or C-g are needed to predict and understand the
   composition dependence of Poisson's ratio. Finally, we also infer from
   literature data that, in addition to high nu, high Young's modulus is
   also needed to obtain glasses with high fracture toughness.}},

Title = {{User Participation and Engagement With the See Me Smoke-Free mHealth
   App: Prospective Feasibility Trial}},
Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Background: The See Me Smoke-Free (SMSF) mobile health (mHealth) app was
   developed to help women quit smoking by targeting concerns about body
   weight, body image, and self-efficacy through cognitive behavioral
   techniques and guided imagery audio files addressing smoking, diet, and
   physical activity. A feasibility trial found associations between SMSF
   usage and positive treatment outcomes. This paper reports a detailed
   exploration of program use among eligible individuals consenting to
   study participation and completing the baseline survey (participants)
   and ineligible or nonconsenting app installers (nonparticipants), as
   well as the relationship between program use and treatment outcomes.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether (1)
   participants were more likely to set quit dates, be current smokers, and
   report higher levels of smoking at baseline than nonparticipants; (2)
   participants opened the app and listened to audio files more frequently
   than nonparticipants; and (3) participants with more app usage had a
   higher likelihood of self-reported smoking abstinence at follow up.
   Methods: The SMSF feasibility trial was a single arm, within-subjects,
   prospective cohort study with assessments at baseline and 30 and 90 days
   post enrollment. The SMSF app was deployed on the Google Play Store for
   download, and basic profile characteristics were obtained for all app
   installers. Additional variables were assessed for study participants.
   Participants were prompted to use the app daily during study
   participation. Crude differences in baseline characteristics between
   trial participants and nonparticipants were evaluated using t tests
   (continuous variables) and Fisher exact tests (categorical variables).
   Exact Poisson tests were used to assess group-level differences in mean
   usage rates over the full study period using aggregate Google Analytics
   data on participation and usage. Negative binomial regression models
   were used to estimate associations of app usage with participant
   baseline characteristics after adjustment for putative confounders.
   Associations between app usage and self-reported smoking abstinence were
   assessed using separate logistic regression models for each outcome
   measure.
   Results: Participants (n=151) were more likely than nonparticipants
   (n=96) to report female gender (P<.02) and smoking in the 30 days before
   enrollment (P<.001). Participants and nonparticipants opened the app and
   updated quit dates at the same average rate (rate ratio {[}RR] 0.98;
   95\% CI 0.92-1.04; P=.43), but participants started audio files (RR
   1.07; 95\% CI 1.00-1.13; P<.04) and completed audio files (RR 1.11; 95\%
   CI 1.03-1.18; P<.003) at significantly higher rates than
   nonparticipants. Higher app usage among participants was positively
   associated with some smoking cessation outcomes.
   Conclusions: This study suggests potential efficacy of the SMSF app, as
   increased usage was generally associated with higher self-reported
   smoking abstinence. A planned randomized controlled trial will assess
   the SMSF app's efficacy as an intervention tool to help women quit
   smoking.}},

Abstract = {{Background In January, 2014, the Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act was
   signed into law in Nigeria, further criminalising same-sex sexual
   relationships. We aimed to assess the immediate effect of this
   prohibition act on stigma, discrimination, and engagement in HIV
   prevention and treatment services in men who have sex with men (MSM) in
   Nigeria.
   Methods The TRUST cohort study uses respondent-driven sampling to assess
   the feasibility and effectiveness of engagement of MSM in HIV prevention
   and treatment services at a clinical site located with a community-based
   organisation trusted by the MSM community. TRUST is a prospective
   implementation research cohort of MSM (>= 16 years) in Abuja, Nigeria.
   We compared HIV clinical outcomes and stigma, including fear and
   avoidance of health care, across baseline and quarterly visits before
   and after implementation of the the Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act.
   Outcomes assessed were measures of stigma and discrimination, loss to
   follow-up, antiretroviral therapy status, and viral load. We compared
   outcomes before and after the legislation with chi(2) statistics, and
   estimated incident stigma-related events and loss to follow-up with
   Poisson regression.
   Findings Between March 19, 2013, and Aug 7, 2014, 707 MSM participated
   in baseline study procedures, contributing to 756 before legislation
   (prelaw) and 420 after legislation (postlaw) visits. Reported history of
   fear of seeking health care was significantly higher in postlaw visits
   than in prelaw visits (n=161 {[}38\%] vs n=187 {[}25\%]; p<0.0001), as
   was avoidance of health care (n=118 {[}28\%] vs n=151 {[}20\%];
   p=0.001). In incidence analyses, of 192 MSM with follow-up data and no
   history of an event at baseline, reported fear of seeking health care
   was higher in the postlaw than the prelaw period (n=144; incidence rate
   ratio 2.57, 95\% CI 1.29-5.10; p=0.007); loss to follow-up and incident
   healthcare avoidance were similar across periods. Of the 161 (89\%) of
   181 HIV-infected MSM with HIV viral loads available, those who had
   disclosed sexual behaviour with a health-care provider were more often
   virally suppressed at baseline than those with no previous disclosure
   (18 {[}29\%] of 62 vs 13 {[}13\%] of 99 men; p=0.013).
   Interpretation These analyses represent individual-level, quantitative,
   real-time prospective data for the health-related effects resulting from
   the enactment of legislation further criminalising same-sex practices.
   The negative effects of HIV treatment and care in MSM reinforce the
   unintended consequences of such legislation on global goals of HIV
   eradication. Strategies to reach MSM less likely to engage in HIV
   testing and care in highly stigmatised environments are needed to reduce
   time to HIV diagnosis and treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although cigarette smoking has consistently been shown to be
   positively related to the risk of adenomatous polyp development (benign
   neoplastic growth of epithelial tissue in the colon), most studies of
   cigarette smoking and the risk of colorectal cancer have been negative,
   However, in two large prospective studies in women and men, a
   statistically significant association between cigarette smoking and an
   increased risk of colorectal cancer was found, but only after more than
   35 years of smoking, Purpose: To shed further light on the alleged
   relationship between long-term smoking and colorectal cancer risk, we
   performed a retrospective cohort study among Swedish construction
   workers, with many long-term smokers, complete long-term follow-up, and
   a large number of observed cases, Methods: We analyzed the association
   of smoking with colon cancer and with rectal cancer, using data on a
   cohort of approximately 135 000 male construction workers, High-quality
   exposure information was collected with the use of a comprehensive
   questionnaire filled out at the time of enrollment in the cohort, from
   1971 through 1975, Complete follow-up was achieved through 1991 and the
   subjects were observed for an average of 17.6 years, thereby
   contributing approximately 2 375 000 person-years of folllow-up, We
   calculated age-adjusted rate ratios (RRs) with the use of Poisson-based
   multiplicative multivariate models followed by further multivariate
   modeling that adjusted for either variables. Results: A total of 713
   incident colon cancers and 505 rectal cancers were observed, There was
   no statistically significant association between current smoking status,
   number of cigarettes smoked or number of years smoking, and risk of
   colorectal cancer, The age-adjusted RRs were 0.98 (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = 0.82-1.17) and 1.16 (95\% CI 0.94-1.44) for colon and
   rectal cancers, respectively, among current smokers, and 1.07 (95\% CI =
   0.63-1.82) and 1,08 (95\% CI = 0.58-2.033 among smokers of 25 or more
   cigarettes per day, relative to nonsmokers, Among smokers for more than
   30 years at the start of follow-up, the age-adjusted RRs were 1.03 (95\%
   CI = 0.85-1.35) and 1.21 (95\% CE = 0.96-1.53) for colon and rectal
   cancers, respectively; relative to nonsmokers, Heavy smokers of cigars
   and pipes had a statistically nonsignificant tendency toward excess risk
   for colon cancer, but there was no clear dose-risk trend, Conclusion:
   Our large cohort study did not indicate any excess risk of colon cancer
   in males who were long-term heavy smokers and weak support for an Our
   the majority of previous reports, The reasons for the discrepancies in
   comparison with recent U.S. data have yet to be identified.}},

Abstract = {{The White Mountain Batholith in central New Hampshire is a major
   plutonic, topographic and gravimetric feature, superimposed on the NE-SW
   trending regional pattern of accreted terranes in northeastern North
   America.  Compressional and shear-wave arrival times from a
   two-dimensional seismic array experiment are used to constrain a
   one-dimensional crustal velocity model and Moho topography for central
   New Hampshire.  Our deployment, a `'piggyback'' on the Ontario-New
   York-New England refraction experiment (ONYNEX), recorded 10 explosive
   sources using 20 three-component digital seismometers.  The crust can be
   modeled as 34.5 km thick, and with three layers having linear gradients
   without midcrust discontinuities.  For this model, P-velocities are
   6.1-6.2 km/s in the upper crust, and 6.2-6.8 km/s in the lower crust. 
   S-velocities are 3.5-3.7 km/s in the upper crust, and 3.7-3.9 km/s in
   the lower crust.  Because Moho reflections comprise our principal
   constraints on lower-crustal velocities, there is a tradeoff between
   lower-crustal velocity and crustal thickness.  In particular, an average
   crustal thickness of 39-40 km, reported elsewhere in New England, is not
   precluded by our data.  The Poisson's ratio for the crust varies between
   0.23-0.26, in the lower range of values reported for crustal minerals. 
   Our dataset is consistent with less-than-or-similar-to 2\% lateral
   variation in the upper crust underlying the New Hampshire and White
   Mountain Plutonic Series, but larger variations deeper than 15 km.  If
   modeled in terms of Moho topography, PmP traveltime residuals and PmP -
   P residuals suggest thicker crust (36-37 km) under the White Mountain
   batholith, with thinner crust (33-34 km) to the east and southwest of
   the White Mountains.  Such topography of the Moho correlates well with
   both the surface elevation and the Bouguer gravity anomaly in the
   region.  Gravity data do not favor the simplest alternative model:  a
   thick low-velocity granitic lower crust beneath the batholith.  Using a
   simplified density model, roughly 30-35\% of the gravity anomaly in the
   White Mountain region can be modeled as the result of the inferred Moho
   depression, requiring only a 5 km low-density root for the White
   Mountain batholith.  The short wavelength of the Moho topography is
   consistent with a very low flexural rigidity for the lithosphere
   (almost-equal-to 10(21) Nt-m), suggesting that the plutons were intruded
   into a weak lithosphere.  A rapid transition from positive to negative
   PmP residuals falls along a line that parallels the onshore extension of
   the Kelvin Seamounts, and may correspond to the `'line of weakness''
   hypothesized by Sykes (1978) to have been tectonically active during the
   opening of the North Atlantic Ocean at 100-200 Ma.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To study trends in the prevalence and incidence of HIV-1 and
   HIV-2 infections in Guinea-Bissau over the last 7 years, and to evaluate
   the protective effect of HIV-2 against HIV-1 infection.
   Design: Prospective follow-up of a cohort of police officers in
   Guinea-Bissau, and sentinel surveillance of pregnant women in Bissau.
   Methods: Participants in the police cohort were tested regularly for
   antibodies to HIV and Treponema pallidum, and information about sexual
   risk behaviour and a history of sexually transmitted diseases was
   obtained. Simultaneously, pregnant women at the maternity wards at the
   National Hospital in Bissau were screened annually For HIV antibodies.
   To evaluate changes in prevalence and incidence of HIV in the police
   cohort, the study period was divided into three time strata with 2-3
   years in each stratum. For the evaluation of a protective effect of
   HIV-2 on subsequent HIV-1 infection, two multivariate Poisson regression
   models were constructed, adjusting For different selected confounding
   variables.
   Results: Between 1990 and 1997, 2637 police officers were included in
   the cohort study, 90.7\% of whom were male. The overall prevalence of
   HIV-1 was 0.9\%, of HIV-2 it was 9.7\% and of HIV-1 and HIV-2 dual
   reactivity it was 0.5\%. For pregnant women the prevalence rates were
   0.9, 5.5 and 0.2\% for HIV-1, HIV-2 and dual reactivity respectively.
   The prevalence of HIV-1 increased significantly whereas the prevalence
   of HIV-2 declined significantly during the study period, among both
   police officers and pregnant women. The total incidence of HIV-1 and
   HIV-2 was 0.74 and 0.83 per 100 person-years respectively in the police
   cohort. The incidence of HIV-1 increased slightly from 0.62 to 0.78 per
   100 person-years (not significant), whereas the incidence of HIV-2
   declined significantly from 0.90 to 0.33 per 100 person-years over the
   study period. Seven police officers seroconverted From HIV-2 to dual
   reactivity (1.22 per 100 person-years). The adjusted incidence ratio of
   acquiring HIV-1 infection among HIV-2 positive subjects compared with
   HIV-negative subjects was 1.65 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI),
   0.73-3.74] and 1.98 (95\% CI, 0.80-4.87), depending on the confounding
   variables included.
   Conclusions: Our study shows an increasing prevalence of HIV-1 and a
   decreasing prevalence of HIV-2 in Guinea-Bisaau. The incidence of HIV-2
   declined significantly whereas the incidence of HIV-1 was relatively
   stable over the study period. No protective effect of HIV-2 against
   subsequent HIV-1 infection was observed, instead HIV-2-positive subjects

Abstract = {{As one of the most important and versatile elements, carbon renders
   itself as one of the most fundamental and cutting-edge topics in
   chemistry, physics, and materials science. Many carbon-based chemical
   rules were established accordingly. While the tetrahedral predilection
   of tetracoordinate carbon has been a cornerstone of organic chemistry
   since 1874, almost a century later tetracoordinate carbon was found to
   be able to adopt planar structures known as planar tetracoordinate
   carbon (ptC), which are stabilized electronically by good pi-acceptor
   (delocalization of a lone electron pair of ptC) or sigma-donor
   (promoting electron transfer to electron-deficient bonding) substituents
   or mechanically by appropriate steric enforcement. The experimental and
   theoretical achievements for the rule-breaking ptC species totally
   refreshed our understanding of chemical bonding and triggered
   exploration of peculiar molecules featuring planar pentacoordinate
   carbon (ppC) and planar hexacoordinate carbon (phC) as well as other
   outlandish species such as planar hypercoordinate silicon.
   While the planar hypercoordinate carbon chemistry has been gradually
   established for molecules in the past five decades, there is growing
   interest in pursuing their extension systems, especially in
   two-dimensional (2D) space as a result of the recent extensive studies
   of graphene and its analogues. Though the natural 2D layered crystals do
   not contain any planar hypercoordinate carbon or silicon, several 2D
   nanosheets featuring planar or quasi-planar hypercoordinate ones have
   been theoretically suggested. Encouragingly, these unique planar
   configurations possess decent stabilities, and some of them are even the
   global minimum structure, exhibiting great potential for experimental
   realization. As the nature of a material is mainly determined by its
   structural characteristics (e.g., dimensionality, crystallography, and
   bonding), the combination of planar hypercoordinate chemistry and 2D
   nanoscience not only endows these rule-breaking systems with the merits
   of 2D materials but also may offer various promising properties and
   applications. For example, an unusual negative Poisson's ratio can be
   found in ppC-containing Be5C2 and planar pentacoordinate silicon
   (ppSi)-containing CaSi monolayers, of which the former has an
   anisotropic Dirac cone and the latter is a semiconductor with a
   desirable band gap for the semiconductor industry. Specially, shortly
   after the theoretical prediction, a planar hexacoordinate silicon
   (phSi)-containing Cu2Si monolayer was experimentally synthesized and
   characterized with the 2D Dirac nodal line fermion, which offers a
   platform to achieve high-speed, low-dissipation nanodevices.
   In this Account, we review the recent progress, mostly by density
   functional theory (DFT) computations, in designing 2D materials with
   planar hypercoordinate motifs. We describe the key achievements in this
   field, paying special attention to the ``bottom-up{''} and
   ``isoelectronic substitution{''} design strategies. In addition, the
   fundamental stabilization mechanisms of planar hypercoordinate motifs in
   an infinite layer are discussed. We hope that this Account will inspire
   more experimental and theoretical efforts to explore nanomaterials with
   such unconventional chemical bonding.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Use of resorbable external reinforcement of the pulmonary
   autograft during the Ross operation has been suggested, but the
   differential regional potential for dilation of the aorta, mainly
   regarding the neo-root and the neo-Valsalva sinuses, represents an
   unresolved issue. Auxetic materials could be useful in preventing
   dilation given their favorable mechanical properties. We designed a
   composite semiresorbable armoured bioprosthesis constituted by
   polydioxanone and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and evaluated its
   effectiveness as a pulmonary autograft reinforcement device in an animal
   model of the Ross procedure.
   Methods: An experimental model of the Ross procedure was performed in 20
   three-month-old growing lambs. The pulmonary autograft was alternatively
   non-reinforced (control group n = 10) or reinforced with composite
   bioprosthesis (reinforced group n = 10). Animals were followed up during
   growth for 6 months by angiography and echocardiography. Specific
   stainings for extracellular matrix and immunohistochemistry for
   metalloproteinase-9 were performed.
   Results: Reference aortic diameter increased from 14 +/- 1mm to 19 +/- 2
   mm over 6 months of growth. In the control group, pulmonary autograft
   distension (28 +/- 2 mm) was immediately noted, followed by aneurysm
   development at 6 months (40 +/- 2 mm, P <. 001 vs reference). In the
   reinforced group, an initial dilation to 18 +/- 1 mm was detected and
   the final diameter was 27 +/- 2 mm (42\% increase). Two deaths due to
   pulmonary autograft rupture occurred in the control group. On histology,
   the control group showed medial disruption with connective fibrous
   replacement, whereas in the reinforced group compensatory intimal
   hyperplasia was present in the absence of intimal tears. The
   bioprosthesis promoted a positive matrix rearrangement process favoring
   neoarterialization and elastic remodeling as demonstrated on specific
   staining for elastin collagen and metalloproteinase- 9.
   Conclusions: The device adapted and functionally compensated for the
   characteristics of autograft growth, guaranteeing a reasonable size of
   the autograft at 6 months, but more important, because the device is
   biocompatible, it did not disrupt the biological process of growth or
   cause inflammatory damage to the wall.}},

Abstract = {{A high-fidelity generalized method of cells (HFGMC) model for the
   micromechanical behavior of porous and composite microstructures has
   been previously developed. Based on this model, a newapproach has been
   developed to optimize porous microstructures for `porous materials by
   design'. This approach uses a combination of genetic algorithms (GA)
   (stochastic), coarse ( periodic) and Newton-Raphson ( gradient)
   optimization methods. In order to parametrize the unit cell of the
   microstructure for optimization and satisfy continuity conditions for
   the method of cells, lines of mass are used in each direction of the
   unit cell. Due to the nature of the optimization problem for porous
   microstructures, there can be multiple choices of mechanical and
   microstructural characteristics ( e. g. axial stress, transverse strain,
   and mass) for the objective function (i.e. multi-objective) implying a
   Pareto optimality problem. For the porous materials by design problem
   based on mechanical characteristics, a predescribed mechanical response
   was chosen for a random distribution of mass to fit via a least squares
   objective function. The effects of implementing the combination of
   optimization methods on their convergence rate and optimized solutions
   were then studied, as well as variations in the weighting of the
   objective functions. A hyperelastic material behavior, Mooney-Rivlin,
   typically associated with natural and synthetic rubbers, is chosen to
   demonstrate the ability to optimize an engineered microstructure for a
   new class of super-lightweight energy-absorbing materials. These results
   indicate that the combination of the GA, coarse search and
   Newton-Raphson optimization techniques can substantially accelerate the
   convergence rate. Also, there is significant variability in the
   optimized microstructure depending on the choice of the weights for the
   associated Pareto optimality, as well as the choice of terms for the
   objective function. Parametrizing the porous microstructure using
   multiple lines of mass can create a more complex microstructure, but
   commoncenters of mass should be employed to minimize mass while
   improving convergence rates and optimal constitutive behavior. This new
   approach was applied to identify microstructures for three new porous
   materials by design: ( a) a superelastic polymer, (b) an incompressible
   material and ( c) an auxetic material.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is an important
   cause of stroke; however, little is known about racial differences in
   ICAD prevalence and its risk factors.
   OBJECTIVE To determine racial differences in ICAD prevalence and the
   risk factors (both midlife and concurrent) associated with its
   development in a large. US community-based cohort. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
   PARTICIPANTS Analysis of 1752 black and white participants recruited
   from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort study who
   underwent 3-dimensional intracranial vessel wall magnetic resonance
   imaging from October 18,2011 to December 30, 2013; data analysis was
   performed from October 18,2011 to May 13,2015.
   EXPOSURES Midlife and concurrent cardiovascular risk factors.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Intracranial plaque presence, size (maximum
   normalized wall index) and number were assessed by vessel wall magnetic
   resonance imaging. Midlife and concurrent vascular risk factor
   associations were determined by Poisson regression (plaque presence),
   negative binominal regression (plaque number), and linear regression
   (plaque size), and compared between races.
   RESULTS Of the 1752 study participants (mean {[}SD] age, 77.6 {[}5.3]
   years; range, 67-90 years). 1023 (58.4\%) were women and 518 (29.6\%)
   were black. Black men had the highest prevalence (50.9\% vs 35.9\% for
   black women, 35.5\% for white men. and 30.2\% for white women; P < .001)
   and the highest frequency (22.4\% vs 12.1\% for black women, 10.7\% for
   white men, and 8.7\% for white women; P < .01) of multiple plaques.
   Prevalence increased with age. reaching 50\% before ages 68, 84, and 88
   years in black men, white men, and white women, respectively (ICAD
   prevalence remained <50\% in black women). Midlife hypertension and
   hyperlipidemia were associated with 29\% (prevalence ratio {[}PR], 1.29;
   95\% CI, 1.08-1.55) and 18\% (PR, 1.18; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.42),
   respectively, increased ICAD prevalence with no significant differences
   between races. Midlife hypertension was also associated with larger
   plaques (1.11 higher mean maximum normalized wall index; 95\% CI,
   0.21-2.01), Midlife smoking and diabetes were associated with increased
   risk of ICAD in black individuals (102\% {[}PR, 2.02; 95\% CI,
   1.12-3.63] and 57\% {[}PR, 1.57; 95\% CI, 1.13-2.19], respectively), but
   not in white participants (P < .05 interaction by race).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The prevalence of ICAD was highest in black
   men. Midlife smoking and diabetes were strongly associated with
   late-life ICAD in blacks only, whereas midlife hypertension and
   hyperlipidemia were associated with late-life ICAD in both races. These
   associations may help to explain racial differences in US stroke rates
   and offer insight into preventive risk-factor management strategies.}},

   (ED). Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to either a 0/1-hour
   hs-cTnT protocol (reported to the limit of detection {[}<5 ng/L]) or
   masked hs-cTnT reported to <= 29 ng/L evaluated at 0/3-hours (standard
   arm). The 30-day primary end point was all-cause death and myocardial
   infarction. Noninferiority was defined as an absolute margin of 0.5\%
   determined by Poisson regression. Results: In total, 3378 participants
   with an emergency presentation were randomly assigned between August
   2015 and April 2019. Ninety participants were deemed ineligible or
   withdrew consent. The remaining participants received care guided either
   by the 0/1-hour hs-cTnT protocol (n=1646) or the 0/3-hour standard
   masked hs-cTnT protocol (n=1642) and were followed for 30 days. Median
   age was 59 (49-70) years, and 47\% were female. Participants in the
   0/1-hour arm were more likely to be discharged from the ED (0/1-hour
   arm: 45.1\% versus standard arm: 32.3\%, P<0.001) and median ED length
   of stay was shorter (0/1-hour arm: 4.6 {[}interquartile range, 3.4-6.4]
   hours versus standard arm: 5.6 (interquartile range, 4.0-7.1) hours,
   P<0.001). Those randomly assigned to the 0/1-hour protocol were less
   likely to undergo functional cardiac testing (0/1-hour arm: 7.5\% versus
   standard arm: 11.0\%, P<0.001). The 0/1-hour hs-cTnT protocol was not
   inferior to standard care (0/1-hour arm: 17/1646 {[}1.0\%] versus
   16/1642 {[}1.0\%]; incidence rate ratio, 1.06 {[} 0.53-2.11],
   noninferiority P value=0.006, superiority P value=0.867), although an
   increase in myocardial injury was observed. Among patients discharged
   from ED, the 0/1-hour protocol had a negative predictive value of 99.6\%
   (95\% CI, 99.0-99.9\%) for 30-day death or myocardial infarction.
   Conclusions: This in-practice evaluation of a 0/1-hour hs-cTnT protocol
   embedded in ED care enabled more rapid discharge of patients with
   suspected acute coronary syndrome. Improving short-term outcomes among
   patients with newly recognized troponin T elevation will require an
   evolution in management strategies for these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of materials have long been one of the most
   fundamental and studied areas of materials science for a myriad of
   applications. Recently, mechanical metamaterials have been shown to
   possess extraordinary effective properties, such as negative dynamic
   modulus and/or density, phononic bandgaps, superior thermoelectric
   properties, and high specific energy absorption. To obtain such
   materials on appropriate length scales to enable novel mechanical
   devices, it is often necessary to effectively design and fabricate
   micro-/nano- structured materials. In this Review, various aspects of
   the micro-/nano-structured materials as mechanical metamaterials,
   potential tools for their multidimensional fabrication, and selected
   methods for their structural and performance characterization are
   described, as well as some prospects for the future developments in this
   exciting and emerging field.}},

Title = {{Thermal shifts and intermittent linear response of aging systems}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{4, 1}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{At time t after an initial quench, an aging system responds to a
   perturbation turned on at time t(w)< t in a way mainly depending on the
   number of intermittent energy fluctuations, so-called quakes, which fall
   within the observation interval (t(w),t] {[}P. Sibani, G. F. Rodriguez,
   and G. G. Kenning, Phys. Rev. B 74, 224407 (2006); P. Sibani, Eur. J.
   Phys. B 58, 483 (2007)]. The temporal distribution of the quakes implies
   a functional dependence of the average response on the ratio t/t(w).
   Further insight is obtained imposing small temperature steps, so-called
   T shifts. The average response as a function of t/t(w,eff), where
   t(w,eff) is the effective age, is similar to the response of a system
   aged isothermally at the final temperature. Using an Ising model with
   plaquette interactions, the applicability of analytic formulas for the
   average isothermal magnetization is confirmed. The T-shifted aging
   behavior of the model is approximately described using effective ages.
   Large positive shifts nearly reset the effective age. Negative T shifts
   offer a more detailed probe of the dynamics. Assuming the marginal
   stability of the ``current{''} attractor against thermal noise
   fluctuations, the scaling form t(w,eff)=t(w)(x) and the dependence of
   the exponent x on the aging temperatures before and after the shift are
   theoretically available. The predicted form of x has no adjustable
   parameters. Both the algebraic scaling of the effective age and the form
   of the exponent reasonably agree with the data. The present simulations
   thus confirm the crucial role of marginal stability in glassy
   relaxation.}},

Title = {{Imported Dengue Cases, Weather Variation and Autochthonous Dengue
   Incidence in Cairns, Australia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Dengue fever (DF) outbreaks often arise from imported DF
   cases in Cairns, Australia. Few studies have incorporated imported DF
   cases in the estimation of the relationship between weather variability
   and incidence of autochthonous DF. The study aimed to examine the impact
   of weather variability on autochthonous DF infection after accounting
   for imported DF cases and then to explore the possibility of developing
   an empirical forecast system.
   Methodology/principal finds: Data on weather variables, notified DF
   cases (including those acquired locally and overseas), and population
   size in Cairns were supplied by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology,
   Queensland Health, and Australian Bureau of Statistics. A time-series
   negative-binomial hurdle model was used to assess the effects of
   imported DF cases and weather variability on autochthonous DF incidence.
   Our results showed that monthly autochthonous DF incidences were
   significantly associated with monthly imported DF cases (Relative Risk
   (RR): 1.52; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-2.28), monthly minimum
   temperature (degrees C) (RR: 2.28; 95\% CI: 1.77-2.93), monthly relative
   humidity (\%) (RR: 1.21; 95\% CI: 1.06-1.37), monthly rainfall (mm) (RR:
   0.50; 95\% CI: 0.31-0.81) and monthly standard deviation of daily
   relative humidity (\%) (RR: 1.27; 95\% CI: 1.08-1.50). In the zero
   hurdle component, the occurrence of monthly autochthonous DF cases was
   significantly associated with monthly minimum temperature (Odds Ratio
   (OR): 1.64; 95\% CI: 1.01-2.67).
   Conclusions/significance: Our research suggested that incidences of
   monthly autochthonous DF were strongly positively associated with
   monthly imported DF cases, local minimum temperature and inter-month
   relative humidity variability in Cairns. Moreover, DF outbreak in Cairns
   was driven by imported DF cases only under favourable seasons and
   weather conditions in the study.}},

Title = {{HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis in men who have sex with men and
   transgender women: a secondary analysis of a phase 3 randomised
   controlled efficacy trial}},
Journal = {{LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{468-475}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background For maximum effect pre-exposure prophylaxis should be
   targeted to the subpopulations that account for the largest proportion
   of infections (population-attributable fraction {[}PAF]) and for whom
   the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent infection is lowest. We
   aimed to estimate the PAF and NNT of participants in the iPrEx
   (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Initiative) trial.
   Methods The iPrEx study was a randomised controlled efficacy trial of
   pre-exposure prophylaxis with coformulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
   and emtricitabine in 2499 men who have sex with men (MSM) and
   transgender women. Participants aged 18 years or older who were male at
   birth were enrolled from 11 trial sites in Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, South
   Africa, Thailand, and the USA. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1)
   to receive either a pill with active pre-exposure prophylaxis or
   placebo, taken daily. We calculated the association between demographic
   and risk behaviour during screening and subsequent seroconversion among
   placebo recipients using a Poisson model, and we calculated the PAF and
   NNT for risk behaviour subgroups. The iPrEx trial is registered with
   ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00458393.
   Findings Patients were enrolled between July 10,2007, and Dec 17,2009,
   and were followed up until Nov 21,2010. Of the 2499 MSM and transgender
   women in the iPrEx trial, 1251 were assigned to pre-exposure prophylaxis
   and 1248 to placebo. 83 of 1248 patients in the placebo group became
   infected with HIV during follow-up. Participants reporting receptive
   anal intercourse without a condom seroconverted significantly more often
   than those reporting no anal sex without a condom (adjusted hazard ratio
   {[}AHR] 5-11,95\% CI 1.55-16.79). The overall PAF for MSM and
   transgender women reporting receptive anal intercourse without a condom
   was 64\% (prevalence 60\%). Most of this risk came from receptive anal
   intercourse without a condom with partners with unknown serostatus (PAF
   53\%, prevalence 54\%, AHR 4.76,95\% CI 1.44-15.71); by contrast, the
   PAF for receptive anal intercourse without a condom with an HIV-positive
   partner was 1\% (prevalence 1\%, AHR 7.11,95\% CI 0.70-72.75). The
   overall NNT per year for the cohort was 62 (95\% CI 44-147). NNTs were
   lowest for MSM and transgender women self-reporting receptive anal
   intercourse without a condom (NNT 36), cocaine use (12), or a sexually
   transmitted infection (41). Having one partner and insertive anal sex
   without a condom had the highest NNTs (100 and 77, respectively).
   Interpretation Pre-exposure prophylaxis may be most effective at a
   population level if targeted toward MSM and transgender women who report
   receptive anal intercourse without a condom, even if they perceive their
   partners to be HIV negative. Substance use history and testing for STIs
   should also inform individual decisions to start pre-exposure
   prophylaxis. Consideration of the PAF and NNT can aid in discussion of
   the benefits and risks of pre-exposure prophylaxis with MSM and
   transgender women.}},

Abstract = {{A nonlinear micromechanical model for two-dimensional irregular
   hexagonal foams has been developed that allows for anisotropy in
   morphology and/or material. Based upon the orientation, cross section,
   length, and material properties of each strut, the resulting microlevel
   beam behavior within the unit cell determines its structural properties.
   Nonlinearity is introduced as coupled elastoplastic beam behavior, where
   the elastoplastic behavior of each beam is considered. The analytical
   formulation for the stiffness matric of the general elastoplastic unit
   cell is found by considering compatibility and equilibrium of the unit
   cell. The structural properties of the elastoplastic unit cell are
   embedded in a continuum finite element model as material properties,
   thus capturing the microstructure of the foam in an accurate and
   efficient mode. Structural nonlinearity is therefore directly linked to
   localized plasticity and its evolution at the microlevel. Elastic
   analyses investigated the degree of anisotropy in structural properties
   that was induced by various morphological changes. The differences in
   stress and deformation behavior between a regular hexagonal foam and a
   re-entrant foam were also demonstrated. Plastic analyses showed how
   structural nonlinearity could be explained by localized microstructural
   behavior. The advantage of this micromechanical model is that it allows
   a study of the effects of morphology and/or material anisotropies on the
   overall foam behavior.}},

Title = {{Outcomes of a Heart Failure Telemonitoring Program Implemented as the
   Standard of Care in an Outpatient Heart Function Clinic:
   Pretest-Posttest Pragmatic Study}},

Abstract = {{Background: Telemonitoring (TM) can improve heart failure (HF) outcomes
   by facilitating patient self-care and clinical decisions. The Medly
   program enables patients to use a mobile phone to record daily HF
   readings and receive personalized self-care messages generated by a
   clinically validated algorithm. The TM system also generates alerts,
   which are immediately acted upon by the patients' existing care team.
   This program has been operating for 3 years as part of the standard of
   care in an outpatient heart function clinic in Toronto, Canada.
   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the 6-month impact of this TM
   program on health service utilization, clinical outcomes, quality of
   life (QoL), and patient self-care.
   Methods: This pragmatic quality improvement study employed a
   pretest-posttest design to compare 6-month outcome measures with those
   at program enrollment. The primary outcome was the number of HF-related
   hospitalizations. Secondary outcomes included all-cause
   hospitalizations, emergency department visits (HF related and all
   cause), length of stay (HF related and all cause), and visits to the
   outpatient clinic. Clinical outcomes included bloodwork (B-type
   natriuretic peptide {[}BNP], creatinine, and sodium), left ventricular
   ejection fraction, and predicted survival score using the Seattle Heart
   Failure Model. QoL was measured using the Minnesota Living with Heart
   Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and the 5-level EuroQol 5-dimensional
   questionnaire Self-care was measured using the Self-Care of Heart
   Failure Index (SCHFI). The difference in outcome scores was analyzed
   using negative binomial distribution and Poisson regressions for the
   health service utilization outcomes and linear regressions for all other
   outcomes to control for key demographic and clinical variables.
   Results: Available data for 315 patients enrolled in the TM program
   between August 2016 and January 2019 were analyzed. A 50\% decrease in
   HF-related hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR]=0.50; P<.001)
   and a 24\% decrease in the number of all-cause hospitalizations
   (IRR=0.76; P=.02) were found when comparing the number of events 6
   months after program enrollment with the number of events 6 months
   before enrollment. With regard to clinical outcomes at 6 months, a 59\%
   decrease in BNP values was found after adjusting for control variables.
   Moreover, 6-month MLHFQ total scores were 9.8 points lower than baseline
   scores (P<.001), representing a clinically meaningful improvement in
   HF-related QoL. Similarly, the MLHFQ physical and emotional subscales
   showed a decrease of 5.4 points (P<.001) and 1.5 points (P=.04),
   respectively. Finally, patient self-care after 6 months improved as
   demonstrated by a 7.8-point (P<.001) and 8.5-point (P=.01) increase in
   the SCHFI maintenance and management scores, respectively. No
   significant changes were observed in the remaining secondary outcomes.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that an HF TM program, which provides
   patients with self-care support and active monitoring by their existing
   care team, can reduce health service utilization and improve clinical,
   QoL, and patient self-care outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The epilepsy treatment gap is largest in resource-poor
   countries. We evaluated the efficacy of a 1-day health education program
   in a rural area of Kenya. The primary outcome was adherence to
   antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as measured by drug levels in the blood, and
   the secondary outcomes were seizure frequency and Kilifi Epilepsy
   Beliefs and Attitudes Scores (KEBAS). Methods Seven hundred thirty-eight
   people with epilepsy (PWE) and their designated supporter were
   randomized to either the intervention (education) or nonintervention
   group. Data were collected at baseline and 1year after the education
   intervention was administered to the intervention group. There were 581
   PWE assessed at both time points. At the end of the study, 105 PWE from
   the intervention group and 86 from the nonintervention group gave blood
   samples, which were assayed for the most commonly used AEDs
   (phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine). The proportions of PWE
   with detectable AED levels were determined using a standard blood assay
   method. The laboratory technicians conducting the assays were blinded to
   the randomization. Secondary outcomes were evaluated using
   questionnaires administered by trained field staff. Modified Poisson
   regression was used to investigate the factors associated with improved
   adherence (transition from nonoptimal AED level in blood at baseline to
   optimal levels at follow-up), reduced seizures, and improved KEBAS,
   which was done as a post hoc analysis. This trial is registered in
   ISRCTN register under ISRCTN35680481. Results There was no significant
   difference in adherence to AEDs based on detectable drug levels (odds
   ratio {[}OR] 1.46, 95\% confidence interval {[}95\% CI] 0.74-2.90,
   p=0.28) or by self-reports (OR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.71-1.40, p=1.00) between
   the intervention and nonintervention group. The intervention group had
   significantly fewer beliefs about traditional causes of epilepsy,
   cultural treatment, and negative stereotypes than the nonintervention
   group. There was no difference in seizure frequency. A comparison of the
   baseline and follow-up data showed a significant increase in
   adherence-intervention group (36-81\% {[}p<0.001]) and nonintervention
   group (38-74\% {[}p<0.001])-using detectable blood levels. The number of
   patients with less frequent seizures (<= 3 seizures in the last 3months)
   increased in the intervention group (62-80\% {[}p=0.002]) and in the
   nonintervention group (67-75\% {[}p=0.04]). Improved therapeutic
   adherence (observed in both groups combined) was positively associated
   with positive change in beliefs about risks of epilepsy (relative risk
   {[}RR] 2.00, 95\% CI 1.03-3.95) and having nontraditional religious
   beliefs (RR 2.01, 95\% CI 1.01-3.99). Reduced seizure frequency was
   associated with improved adherence (RR 1.72, 95\% CI 1.19-2.47).
   Positive changes in KEBAS were associated with having tertiary education
   as compared to none (RR 1.09, 95\% CI 1.05-1.14). Significance Health
   education improves knowledge about epilepsy, but once only contact does
   not improve adherence. However, sustained education may improve
   adherence in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{The ambient structure and pressure-induced structural changes of a
   synthetic sodium aluminogermanate with a natrolite (NAT) framework
   topology (Na-AlGe-NAT) were characterized by using Rietveld refinements
   of high-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data at ambient
   and high pressures. Unlike a previously established model for
   Na8Al8Ge12O40 center dot 8H(2)O based on a single-crystal study, the
   ambient structure of the Na-AlGe-NAT is found to adopt a monoclinic
   space group Cc (or Fd) with a ca. 6\% expanded unit cell. The refined
   ambient structure of Na8Al8Ge12O40 center dot 12H(2)O indicates an
   increased water content of 50\%, compared to the single-crystal
   structure. The unit-cell volume and water-content relationships observed
   between the to the Na-AlGe-NAT structures at ambient conditions with 8
   and 12 H2O respectively seem to mirror the ones found under hydrostatic
   pressure between the Na8Al8Si12O40 center dot 8H(2)O and the
   parantrolite phase Na8Al8Si12O40 center dot 12H(2)O. Under hydrostatic
   pressures mediated by a pore-penetrating alcohol and water mixture, the
   monoclinic Na-AlGe-NAT exhibits a gradual decrease of the unit-cell
   volume up to ca. 2.0 GPa, where the unit-cell volume then contracts
   abruptly by ca. 4.6\%. This is in marked contrast to what is observed in
   the Na-AlSi-NAT and Na-GaSi-NAT systems, where one observes a
   pressure-induced hydration and volume expansion due to the auxetic
   nature of the frameworks. Above 2 GPa, the monoclinic phase of
   Na-AlGe-NAT transforms into a tetragonal structure with the unit-cell
   composition of Na8Al8Ge12O40 center dot 16H(2)O. revealing
   pressure-induced hydration and a unit cell volume contraction. Unlike in
   the Na-Al,Si-paranatrolite phase. however, the sodium cations in the
   Na-AlGe-NAT maintain a 6-fold coordination in the monoclinic structure
   and only become 7-fold coordinated at higher pressures in the tetragonal
   structure. When comparing, the pressure-induced hydration in the
   observed natrolite-type zeolites, Na-AlGe-NAT appears to have a
   nonauxetic framework and reveals the highest onset pressure for complete
   superhydration.}},

Abstract = {{Mass-transfer systems based on electrokinetic phenomena (i.e., capillary
   electrochromatography (CEC)) have shown practical potential for becoming
   powerful separation methods for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
   industries. A dynamic mathematical model, consisting of the momentum
   balance and the Poisson equations, as well as the unsteady-state
   continuity expressions for the cation and anion of the background
   electrolyte and of a positively charged analyte (adsorbate), is
   constructed and solved to determine quantitatively the electroosmotic
   velocity, the electrostatic potential, the concentration profiles of the
   charged species in the double layer and in the electroneutral core
   region of the fluid in the interstitial channels for bulk flow in the
   packed chromatographic column, and the axial current density profiles as
   the adsorbate adsorbs onto the negatively charged fixed sites on the
   surface of the nonporous particles packed in the chromatographic column.
   The frontal analysis mode of operation is simulated in this work. The
   results obtained from model simulations provide significant physical
   insight into and understanding of the development and propagation of the
   dynamic profile of the concentration of the adsorbate (analyte) and
   indicate that sharp, highly resolved adsorption fronts and large amounts
   of adsorbate in the adsorbed phase for a given column length can be
   obtained under the following conditions: (i) The ratio, gamma (2,0), of
   the electroosmotic velocity of the mobile liquid phase at the column
   entrance after the adsorption front has passed the column entrance to
   the electrophoretic velocity of the anion is very close to -1. The
   structure of the equations of the model and model simulations indicate
   that a stable adsorption front cannot develop when gamma (2,0) is less
   than -1 unless the value of the mobility of the cation is less than the
   value of the mobility of the analyte, which may be a rare occurrence in
   practical CEC systems. (ii) The ratio of the mobility of the cation to
   the mobility of the analyte is less than two orders of magnitude. This
   effect becomes more significant as the value of the equilibrium
   adsorption constant, K-A,K-3,K- of the analyte increases. (iii) The
   concentration of the analyte relative to the concentration of the cation
   is increased (feed solutions with less dilute concentrations of the
   analyte are employed). Therefore, to obtain good performance for CEC
   systems operated in the frontal analysis mode (well-resolved adsorption
   fronts and high adsorbate amounts in the adsorbed phase), one can choose
   an electrolyte whose cation has a mobility that is not more than one or
   two orders of magnitude greater than the mobility of the analyte and
   whose anion has a mobility such that the value of gamma (2,0) is close
   to -1; one can then bring the value of gamma (2,0) closer to -1 by
   decreasing the particle diameter, d(p), and/or making the value of the
   surface charge density, delta (0), of the particles more negative (in
   effect, making the value of the zeta potential, zeta (p), at the surface
   of the particles more negative at time t = 0) to change the value of the
   velocity, < upsilon (x)>/(x=0), of the electroosmotic flow (EOF) at the
   column entrance (< upsilon (x)>/(x=0) is determined after the adsorption
   front has passed the column entrance). This approach could provide
   conditions in the column that avoid overloading of the adsorbate.
   One can obtain faster breakthrough times at the sacrifice of resolution
   and utilization of the adsorptive capacity of the packed bed if one
   employs a cation whose mobility is very large relative to the mobility
   of the analyte and/or an anion that provides a value of gamma (2,0)
   significantly greater than -1. If it is possible, one can increase the
   concentration of the analyte in the feed stream to avoid sacrificing
   resolution and adsorptive capacity of the packed bed and still decrease
   the time at which breakthrough occurs. Also, the dynamic behavior of the
   axial current density, i(x), profiles indicates that the magnitude of i,
   and/or the change in the value of i, across the adsorption front could
   serve as a measurement for the rate of propagation of the adsorption
   front through the column. Furthermore, the effect of the decreased
   magnitude of the velocity of the EOF in the region of the column where
   the analyte is present in the adsorbed phase could act to decrease the
   effect of tailing when CEC systems are operated in the pulse injection
   mode (analytical electrochromatography) because the higher velocity of
   the fluid upstream of the migrating adsorption zone may compress the
   tail of the peak. (C) 2001 Academic Press.}},

Title = {{Foundations for Soft, Smart Matter by Active Mechanical Metamaterials}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Emerging interest to synthesize active, engineered matter suggests a
   future where smart material systems and structures operate autonomously
   around people, serving diverse roles in engineering, medical, and
   scientific applications. Similar to biological organisms, a realization
   of active, engineered matter necessitates functionality culminating from
   a combination of sensory and control mechanisms in a versatile material
   frame. Recently, metamaterial platforms with integrated sensing and
   control have been exploited, so that outstanding non-natural material
   behaviors are empowered by synergistic microstructures and controlled by
   smart materials and systems. This emerging body of science around active
   mechanical metamaterials offers a first glimpse at future foundations
   for autonomous engineered systems referred to here as soft, smart
   matter. Using natural inspirations, synergy across disciplines, and
   exploiting multiple length scales as well as multiple physics,
   researchers are devising compelling exemplars of actively controlled
   metamaterials, inspiring concepts for autonomous engineered matter.
   While scientific breakthroughs multiply in these fields, future
   technical challenges remain to be overcome to fulfill the vision of

Abstract = {{An experimental study of the vibratory deformation of the human vocal
   folds was conducted. Experiments were performed using model vocal folds
   {[}1, 2], Fig. 1, made of silicone rubber implemented into an air supply
   system, Fig. 2. The material used to cast the model is an isotropic
   homogeneous material, {[}3] with a tangent modulus E=5 kPa at, epsilon =
   0, i.e. elastic properties similar to those of the human vocal fold
   cover {[}4]. The advantages of the use of model larynx systems over the
   use of excised larynges include easy accessibility to fundamental
   studies of the vocal fold vibration without invasive testing.
   Acoustic analysis of voice or electroglottography provide certain
   insight into voice production processes but optical techniques for the
   study of vocal fold vibrations have drawn considerable attention.
   Videoendoscopy, stroboscopy, highspeed photography, and kymography have
   shown to provide a visual impression of vocal fold dynamics but are
   limited in providing insight into the fundamental deformation processes
   of the vocal folds. Quantitative measures of deformation have been
   conducted through micro-suture techniques but are invasive and allows
   for measurements of only view image points. Laser triangulation is
   non-invasive but is limited to only one local measurement point. Here,
   digital image correlation technique with the software VIC 3D {[}5] is
   applied. For the experimental set-up see Fig. 2. The analysis consists
   of (1) stereo correlation to obtain in-plane displacements and (2)
   stereo triangulation step to obtain out-of-plane deformation. For the
   stereo correlation images of the object at two different stages of
   deformation are compared. A point in the image of the undeformed object
   is matched with the corresponding point in the deformed stage.
   ``Subsets{''} of digital images are traced via their gray value
   distribution from the undeformed reference image to the deformed image.
   The uniqueness of the matching is enabled by the creation of a speckle
   pattern on the object's surface. Here, a white pigment is mixed into the
   silicone rubber and subsequently black enamel paint is sprayed onto the
   superior surface of the vocal folds. The stereo triangulation requires
   two images of the object at each stage of deformation. These are
   obtained in a single CCD frame by placing a beam splitter in the optical
   axis between camera and object. These images provide a ``left{''} and
   ``right{''} view of the model larynx. Thus, the deformed shape of the
   vocal folds can be obtained. The method allows for noninvasive
   measurement of the full-field displacement fields. Images of the
   superior surface of the model larynx are obtained by the use of a high
   speed digital camera with a frame rate of 3000 frames per second
   allowing for more than 30 image frames for each vibration cycle. For the
   3D digital image correlation analysis two images of the object are
   obtained for each time instance as a beam splitter is placed in the
   optical axis between the camera and the model larynx.
   Phonation frequencies and onset pressure are given in Fig. 3, showing
   that the model larynx behavior is close to actual physiological data.
   Figs 4(a) and (b) provide superior views of the model larynx at maximum
   glottal opening and at glottal closure, respectively. As one example of
   measured strain fields, Figs 5(a) and (b) depict the distributions of
   the transverse strain component, on the glottal surface in a contour
   plot on the deformed superior surface. The knowledge of the distribution
   of this strain component is relevant to the assessment of the impact of
   vocal fold collision on potential tissue damage. In the position of
   maximum opening the vocal folds are deformed by a combination of a
   bulging-type deformation and the opening movement. At this time
   instance, the transverse strains at the medial surface are found to be
   negative, an indication of Poisson's deformation. During the closing
   stage, vocal folds collide and simultaneously a mode 3 vibration pattern
   emerges. Closure of the glottal opening is not complete and two
   incomplete closure areas are formed during the closure stage. These open
   areas are located at the anterior and posterior ends of the model
   larynx, see Fig. 4(b). The finding of this type of incomplete closure is
   agreement with both actual glottal measurements {[}6] and 3D finite
   element simulations of {[}7]. Transverse strains during that stage are
   now positive and considerably larger that during the opening stage.
   Finally, Fig. 6 depicts the time evolution of the out of plane
   displacements along the medial surface for the closing phase and Fig. 7
   depicts the maximum values of the longitudinal strain (at the coronal
   section of the medial surface) in dependence of the flow rate.
   These examples of measurements indicate that the DIC method is promising
   for studies of vocal fold dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{House is the major site for malaria infection where most human-vector
   contact takes place. Hence, improving housing might reduce the risk of
   malaria infection by limiting house entry of vectors. This study aimed
   to explore the impact of screening doors and windows with wire meshes on
   density and entomological inoculation rate (EIR) of malaria vector, and
   malaria incidence, and assess the acceptability, durability, and cost of
   the intervention. The susceptibility status of malaria vector was also
   assessed. A two-arm randomized trial was done in Arba Minch Town,
   southwest Ethiopia. 92 houses were randomly included in the trial. The
   baseline entomological and malaria prevalence data were collected. The
   mosquito sampling was done twice per household per month by Centers for
   Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps for six months. The
   baseline prevalence of malaria was assessed by testing 396 (83\% of the
   447 study participants) household members in all the eligible houses.
   The 92 houses were then randomized into control and intervention groups
   using mosquito and malaria prevalence baseline data to make the two
   groups comparable except the intervention. Then, we put wire-mesh on
   doors and windows of 46 houses. Post-screening mosquito collection was
   done in each household twice per month for three months. Each household
   member was visited twice per month for six months to assess malaria
   episodes. The frequency of damage to different structure of screening
   was measured twice. In-depth interview was conducted with 24 purposely
   selected household heads from intervention group. Speciation of
   Anopheles mosquito was done by morphological key, and the
   circum-sporozoite proteins (CSPs) analysis was done using enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay. A generalized estimating equation with a negative
   binomial distribution was used to assess the impact of the intervention
   on the indoor density of vectors. Clinical malaria case data were
   analyzed using Poisson regression with generalized linear model.
   Screening doors and windows reduced the indoor density of An. arabiensis
   by 48\% (mean ratio of intervention to control = 0.85/1.65; 0.52) (P =
   .001). Plasmodium falcipanon CSP rate was 1.6\% (3/190) in the
   intervention houses, while it was 2.7\% (10/ 372) in the control houses.
   The protective efficacy of screening intervention from CSP positive An.
   arabiensis was 41\% (mean ratio of intervention to control = 1.6/2.7;
   0.59), but was not statistically significant (P = .6). The EIR of An.
   arabiensis was 1.91 in the intervention group, whereas it was 6.45 in
   the control group. 477 participants were followed for clinical malaria
   (50.1\% from intervention and 49.9\% from the control group). Of 49 RDT
   positive cases, 45 were confirmed to be positive with microscopy. 80\%
   (n = 36) cases were due to P. falciparum and the rest 20\% (n = 9) were
   due to P. vivax. The incidence of P. falciparum in the intervention
   group was lower (IRR: 0.39, 95\% CI: 0.2-0.80; P = .01) than in the
   control group. Using incidence of P. falciporton infection, the
   protective efficacy of intervention was 61\% (95\% CI: 18-83; P = .007).
   97.9\% of screened windows and 63.8\% of screened doors were intact
   after eleven months of installation. Malaria mosquito was resistance
   (mortality rate of 75\%) to the insecticide used for bed nets treatment.
   Almost all participants of intervention arm were willing to continue
   using screened doors and windows. Screening doors and windows reduced
   the indoor exposure to malaria vectors. The intervention is effective,
   durable and well-accepted.
   Hence, the existing interventions can be supplemented with house
   screening intervention for further reduction and ultimately elimination
   of malaria by reducing insecticide pressure on malaria vectors. However,
   further research could be considered in broad setting on different
   housing improvement and in the way how to scale-up for wider community.}},

Title = {{A review of underwater acoustic metamaterials}},
Journal = {{CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{1396-1410}},
Abstract = {{Underwater acoustic materials are the key to the noise and vibration
   reduction, stealth, reception and amplification of underwater acoustic
   signal. However, conventional underwater acoustic materials usually
   suffer from the weakness of great bulk, heavy weight and poor resistance
   to hydrodynamic pressure. The advancement of the acoustic metamaterials
   (AMMs) has provided new insights into fixing these problems, and a
   variety of underwater AMMs are proposed accordingly.
   This article reviews the history and the developments of underwater AMMs
   and the difficulties that existed in the developments of underwater AMMs
   as compared with the AMMs in air. The focuses are the three types of
   AMMs which are closely associated with the underwater acoustic stealth
   and signal reception \& amplification of hull-mounted sonar, i.e., the
   AMMs for sound absorption, AMMs for decoupling and those for sound
   focusing. The classification, physical mechanisms and controlling
   effects of those three types of underwater AMMs are reviewed in details.
   The AMMs for underwater sound absorption can be divided into
   local-resonance (LR) and non-resonance types. The LR types take
   advantages of the local resonance principle with the controlling
   wavelengths orders of magnitude greater than the physical dimension of a
   unit. To overcome the intrinsic narrow-band limitations of LR and
   broaden the bandwidths, efforts have been made to utilize multilayer
   LR-AMMs or multi-size LRs, attach/embed elastic plate scatter on/into
   elastically coated plate, or introduce complex lattices with multiple
   (coupled) LRs, etc. The non-resonance types are based-on non-resonance
   mechanisms such as viscous loss, heat conduction, macromolecular
   relaxation or a combination of them. These AMMs mainly include porous
   metals and nonmetal materials, gradient AMMs and acoustic meta-surfaces,
   etc. The AMMs for underwater decoupling mainly use acoustically soft
   AMMs to decouple the vibration of the base structure from adjacent
   fluid. These AMMs contain the acoustic coating embedded with various
   cavities or local resonators, gradient coating, re-entrant honeycomb
   structure or structure with negative Poisson's ratio and chiral porous
   coating, etc. The sound-focusing AMMs are categorized into diffractive,
   refractive and reflective types. The diffractive types focus underwater
   sound through constructive interference of diffracted waves, which
   mainly include all kinds of zone plates and fractal lens. The refractive
   types are mainly based on various acoustic lens and focus sound by
   controlling the refraction index of the materials. The reflective types
   focus sound by modulating the reflective waves, including the
   recently-proposed reflective acoustic meta-surfaces and acoustic
   coatings with attached/embedded periodically distributed signal
   conditioning plates, etc.
   Finally, the conclusions and drawbacks of the above AMMs are summarized.
   It is pointed out that although the present underwater AMMs have
   achieved some encouraging results, they are still confronted with
   several key problems such as the realizations of low-frequency and
   broadband, omnidirectional, subwavelength, lightweight and hydrostatic
   pressure resistant sound manipulations, the manufacture and testing of
   large AMM samples, and the environmental adaptations requirements.
   Therefore, there is still a long way for the current underwater AMM
   toward the real application. The trend and outlook toward future
   underwater AMMs are also presented. It is hoped that this review could
   provide guidelines to the design and realization of future materials
   demanded for underwater acoustic stealth and detection.}},

Abstract = {{Background Tens of millions of children are exposed to Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis globally every year; however, there are no contemporary
   estimates of the risk of developing tuberculosis in exposed children.
   The effectiveness of contact investigations and preventive therapy
   remains poorly understood.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the
   development of tuberculosis in children closely exposed to a
   tuberculosis case and followed for incident disease. We restricted our
   search to cohort studies published between Jan 1, 1998, and April 6,
   2018, in MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS, and Embase electronic
   databases. Individual-participant data and a pre-specified list of
   variables were requested from authors of all eligible studies. These
   included characteristics of the exposed child, the index case, and
   environmental characteristics. To be eligible for inclusion in the final
   analysis, a dataset needed to include: (1) individuals below 19 years of
   age; (2) follow-up for tuberculosis for a minimum of 6 months; (3)
   individuals with household or close exposure to an individual with
   tuberculosis; (4) information on the age and sex of the child; and (5)
   start and end follow-up dates. Studies assessing incident tuberculosis
   but without dates or time of follow-up were excluded. Our analysis had
   two primary aims: (1) estimating the risk of developing tuberculosis by
   time-period of follow-up, demographics (age, region), and clinical
   attributes (HIV, tuberculosis infection status, previous tuberculosis);
   and (2) estimating the effectiveness of preventive therapy and BCG
   vaccination on the risk of developing tuberculosis. We estimated the
   odds of prevalent tuberculosis with mixed-effects logistic models and
   estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for incident tuberculosis with
   mixed-effects Poisson regression models. The effectiveness of preventive
   therapy against incident tuberculosis was estimated through propensity
   score matching. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO
   (CRD42018087022).
   Findings In total, study groups from 46 cohort studies in 34
   countries-29 (63\%) prospective studies and 17 (37\%)
   retrospective-agreed to share their data and were included in the final
   analysis. 137 647 tuberculosis-exposed children were evaluated at
   baseline and 130 512 children were followed for 429 538 person-years,
   during which 1299 prevalent and 999 incident tuberculosis cases were
   diagnosed. Children not receiving preventive therapy with a positive
   result for tuberculosis infection had significantly higher 2-year
   cumulative tuberculosis incidence than children with a negative result
   for tuberculosis infection, and this incidence was greatest among
   children below 5 years of age (19.0\% {[}95\% CI 8.4-37.4]). The
   effectiveness of preventive therapy was 63\% (adjusted HR 0.37 {[}95\%
   CI 0.30-0.47]) among all exposed children, and 91\% (adjusted HR 0.09
   {[}0.05-0.15]) among those with a positive result for tuberculosis
   infection. Among all children <5 years of age who developed
   tuberculosis, 83\% were diagnosed within 90 days of the baseline visit.
   Interpretation The risk of developing tuberculosis among exposed infants
   and young children is very high. Most cases occurred within weeks of
   contact investigation initiation and might not be preventable through
   prophylaxis. This suggests that alternative strategies for prevention
   are needed, such as earlier initiation of preventive therapy through
   rapid diagnosis of adult cases or community-wide screening approaches.

Title = {{Acceptability of an mHealth App That Provides Harm Reduction Services
   Among People Who Inject Drugs: Survey Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Background: Harm reduction services reduce the negative consequences of
   drug injection and are often embedded within syringe service programs
   (SSPs). However, people who inject drugs (PWID) suboptimally engage with
   such services because of stigma, fear, transportation restrictions, and
   limited hours of operation. Mobile health (mHealth) apps may provide an
   opportunity to overcome these barriers and extend the reach of SSPs
   beyond that of the traditional brick-and-mortar models.
   Objective: This study aims to assess the prevalence of smartphone
   ownership, the level of comfort in providing the personal information
   required to use mHealth apps, and interest in using an mHealth app to
   access harm reduction services among PWID to guide the development of an
   app.
   Methods: We administered a survey to 115 PWID who were enrolled via
   respondent-driven sampling from July 2018 to July 2019. We examined the
   extent to which PWID had access to smartphones; were comfortable in
   providing personal information such as name, email, and address; and
   expressed interest in various app-based services. We measured
   participant characteristics (demographics, health status, and behaviors)
   and used binary logistic and Poisson regressions to identify independent
   correlates of mHealth-related variables. The primary regression outcomes
   included summary scores for access, comfort, and interest. The secondary
   outcomes included binary survey responses for individual comfort or
   interest components.
   Results: Most participants were White (74/105, 70.5\%), male (78/115,
   67.8\%), and middle-aged (mean=41.7 years), and 67.9\% (74/109) owned a
   smartphone. Participants reported high levels of comfort in providing
   personal information to use an mHealth app, including name (96/109,
   88.1\%), phone number (92/109, 84.4\%), email (85/109, 77.9\%), physical
   address (85/109, 77.9\%), and linkage to medical records (72/109,
   66.1\%). Participants also reported strong interest in app-based
   services, including medication or sterile syringe delivery (100/110,
   90.9\%), lab or appointment scheduling (90/110, 81.8\%), medication
   reminders (77/110, 70\%), educational material (65/110, 59.1\%), and
   group communication forums (64/110, 58.2\%). Most participants were
   comfortable with the idea of home delivery of syringes (93/109, 85.3\%).
   Homeless participants had lower access to smartphones (adjusted odds
   ratio {[}AOR] 0.15, 95\% CI 0.05-0.46; P=.001), but no other participant
   characteristics were associated with primary outcomes. Among secondary
   outcomes, recent SSP use was positively associated with comfort with the
   home delivery of syringes (AOR 3.29, 95\% CI 1.04-10.3 P=.04), and being
   older than 50 years was associated with an increased interest in
   educational materials (AOR 4.64, 95\% CI 1.31-16.5; P=.02) and group
   communication forums (AOR 3.69, 95\% CI 1.10-12.4; P=.04).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that aside from those experiencing
   homelessness or unstable housing, PWID broadly have access to
   smartphones, are comfortable with sharing personal information, and
   express interest in a wide array of services within an app. Given the
   suboptimal access to and use of SSPs among PWID, an mHealth app has a
   high potential to address the harm reduction needs of this vulnerable
   population.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis and biological evaluation of
   perricillamine(6)-5-tert-butylproline(7)-oxytocin analogs and comparison
   with their proline(7)-oxytocin counterparts has led to the discovery of
   two potent oxytocin (OT) antagonists: {[}dPen(1),Pen(6)]-oxytocin (1,
   pA(2) = 8.22, EC50 - 6.0 nm) and {[}dPen(1),Pen(6),5-tBuPro(7)]-oxytocin
   (2, pA(2) = 8.19, EC50 = 6.5 nM). In an attempt to understand the
   conformational requirements for their biological activity, spectroscopic
   analyses of 1 and 2 were perfonned using H-1 NMR, laser Raman and CD
   techniques. In H2O, oxytocin analogs 1 and 2 exhibited cis-isomer
   populations of 7\% and 35\%, respectively. Measurement of the amide
   proton temperature coefficients revealed solvent shielded hydrogens for
   Gin(4) and Pen6 in the major trans-conformer of 1 as well as for Gln(4)
   in the minor cis-conformer of 2. Few long-distance NOES were observed,
   suggesting conformational averaging for analogs 1 and 2 in water;
   moreover, a lower barrier (16.6 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol) for isomerization of
   the amide N-terminal to 5-tBuPro(7) relative to OT was calculated from
   measuring the coalescence temperature of the GlY(9) backbone Nit signals
   in the NMR spectra of 2. Observed bands in the Raman spectra of 1 and 2
   correspond to C-beta-S-S-C-beta dihedral angles of +110-115 degrees and
   90 degrees, respectively. In water, acetonitrile and methanol, the CD
   spectra for 1 xhibited a positive maximum around 236-239 nm; in
   trifluoroethanol, the spectra shifted and a negative maximum was
   observed at 240 nm. The CID spectra of 2 were unaffected by solvent
   changes and exhibited a negative maximum at 236-239 nm. The CID and
   Raman data both suggested that a conformation having a right-handed
   screw sense about the disuffide and a chi(CS-SC) dihedral angle value
   close to 115 degrees was favored for analog 1 in water, methanol and
   acetonitrile, but not trifluoroethanol, where a +/- 90 degrees angle was
   favored. Analog 2 was more resilient to conformational change about the
   disuffide, and adopted a preferred disuffide geometry corresponding to a
   +/- 90 degrees chi(CS-SC) dihedral angle. Monte Carlo conformational
   analysis of analogs 1 and 2 using distance restraints derived from NMR
   spectroscopy revealed two prominent conformational minima for analog 1
   with disultide geometries around + 114 degrees and + 116 degrees.
   Similar analysis of analog 2 revealed one conformational minimum with a
   disuffide geometry around + 104'. In sum, the conformation about the
   disuffide in {[}dPen(1),Pen(6)]-OT (1) was shown to be contingent on
   environment and in TFE, adopted a geometry similar to that of
   {[}dPen(1), Pen(6),5- tBuPro(7)]-OT (2) which appeared to be stabilized
   by hydrophobic interactions between the 5-tBuPro(7) (5R)-tert-butyl
   group, the Len(8) isopropyl sidechain and the Pen(6)beta-methyl
   substituents. In light of the conformational rigidity of 2 about the
   disultide bond, and the similar geometry adopted by 1 in TFE, a S-S
   dihedral angle close to +110 degrees may be a prerequisite for their
   binding at the receptor. Copyright (c) 2005 European Peptide Society and

Abstract = {{Men who have sex with men (MSM) commonly use inhaled nitrites, or
   poppers, though their use is a risk factor HIV seroconversion.
   Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is effective for HIV prevention, but
   is not widely used, and little is known regarding PrEP use and
   acceptability among MSM who use inhaled nitrites. We surveyed 580 MSM in
   Paris, France in 2016 about popper use, sexual behaviors including
   condomless anal intercourse (CAI), serosorting, and sexual positioning,
   PrEP use, PrEP candidacy, and interest in alternate PrEP delivery
   modalities. We included 444 HIV negative participants for the current
   study. 46.2\% reported popper use in the prior 3months. Using
   multivariate adjusted logistic regression, we found that popper users
   were more likely than non-users to consider themselves candidates for
   PrEP {[}adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR)=2.73; 95\% CI 1.54-4.83],
   but they were not more likely to be current (aRRR=1.54; 95\% CI
   0.71-3.33) or past (aRRR=1.37; 95\% CI 0.44-4.28) PrEP users. Mediation
   analyses indicated that increased CAI and serosorting partly explained
   the relationship between popper use and PrEP candidacy. There was
   considerable interest in alternate proposed PrEP delivery modalities,
   particularly long-acting injectable PrEP {[}adjusted risk ratio
   (aRR)=1.43; 95\% CI 1.15-1.79]. ResumenLos hombres que tienen relaciones
   sexuales con hombres (HSH) usan con frequencia los nitritos inhalados,
   tambien conocidos poppers, aunque su uso es un factor de riesgo para la
   seroconversion del virus de inmunodeficiencia humana (VIH). La
   profliaxis prexposicion o PrEP es eficaz para la prevencion del VIH,
   pero no se utiliza ampliamente, y poco se sabe en cuanto al uso y la
   aceptabilidad de PrEP entre los HSH que usan los nitritos inhalados.
   Hicimos una encuesta de 580 HSH en Paris, Francia en cuanto a su uso de
   los poppers, su comportamiento sexual (incluyendo el sexo anal sin
   condones {[}CAI, por sus siglas en ingles, condomless anal intercourse],
   el serosorting {[}tener sexo con personas con el mismo estatus de VIH],
   y el rol sexual {[}active o pasivo]), el uso de PrEP, su candidatura
   percibida para PrEP, y su interes en modalidades alternativas para la
   administracion de PrEP. Incluimos 444 individuos HIV-negativos para este
   studio. 46,2\% indicaron el uso de poppers durante los 3 meses antes de
   la encuesta. Usando la regresion logistica ajustada, descubrimos que los
   HSH que usaban los poppers se consideraban como candidatos para PrEP con
   mas frecuencia que los que no usaban los poppers (indice de riesgo
   relativo ajustado (aRRR, por sus siglas en ingles, adjusted relative
   risk ratio)=2.73; 95\% interval de confianza (CI, por sus siglas en
   ingles, confidence interval) = 1.54-4.83), pero no usaban el PrEP ahora
   (aRRR=1.54; 95\% CI=0.71-3.33) o en el pasado (aRRR=1.37; 95\%
   CI=0.44-4.28) con mas frecuencia que los que no usaban los poppers.
   Analisis de mediacion indicaron que niveles mas altos de CAI y
   serosorting explicaron una parte de la relacion entre el uso de poppers
   y la candidatura percibida para PrEP. Tambien habia interes considerable
   en otras modalidades para la administracion de PrEP, especialmente PrEP
   inyectable de accion prolongada (indice de riesgo ajustado (aRR, por sus
   siglas en ingles, adjusted relative risk)=1.43; 95\% CI=1.15-1.79).}},

   Methods In the prospective cohort study Attitudes to, and Understanding
   of Risk of Acquisition of HIV 2 (AURAH2), MSM were recruited from three
   sexual health clinics in England: two in London and one in Brighton, UK.
   Men were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older and HIV-negative
   or of unknown HIV status. Participants self-completed a baseline paper
   questionnaire at one of the three clinics between July 30, 2013, and
   April 30, 2016, and were subsequently able to complete 4-monthly and
   annual online questionnaires, which were available between March 1,
   2015, and March 31, 2018, and collected information on
   sociodemographics, health and wellbeing, HIV status, and sexual
   behaviours. PrEP and PEP use in the previous 12 months was obtained at
   baseline and in annual questionnaires. We assessed trends over calendar
   time in 3-month periods from first enrolment to the end of the study
   period (July-December, 2013, was counted as one period) in use of PrEP
   and PEP using generalised estimating equation logistic models. We used
   age-adjusted Poisson models to assess factors associated with PrEP
   initiation among participants who reported never having used PrEP at
   baseline.
   Findings 1162 men completed a baseline questionnaire, among whom the
   mean age was 34 years (SD 10.4), and of those with available data, 942
   (82\%) of 1150 were white, 1076 (94\%) of 1150 were gay, and 857 (74\%)
   of 1159 were university educated. 622 (54\%) of 1162 men completed at
   least one follow-up online questionnaire, of whom 483 (78\%) completed
   at least one annual questionnaire. Overall, PrEP use in the past year
   increased from 0\% (none of 28 respondents) in July to December, 2013,
   to 43\% (23 of 53) in January to March, 2018. The corresponding increase
   in PrEP use among men who reported condomless sex with two or more
   partners was from 0\% (none of 13 respondents) to 78\% (21 of 27). PEP
   use peaked in April to June, 2016, at 28\% (41 of 147 respondents), but
   decreased thereafter to 8\% (four of 53) in January to March, 2018.
   Among 460 men who had never used PrEP at baseline, predictors of
   initiating PrEP included age 40-44 years (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR]
   4.25, 95\% CI 1.14-15.79) and 45 years and older (3.59, 1.08-11.97)
   versus younger than 25 years; and after adjustment for age, recent HIV
   test (5.17, 1.89-14.08), condomless sex (5.01, 2.16-11.63), condomless
   sex with two or more partners (5.43, 2.99-9.86), group sex (1.69,
   1.01-2.84), and non-injection chemsex-related drugs use (2.86,
   1.67-4.91) in the past 3 months, PEP use (4.69, 2.83-7.79) in the past
   12 months, and calendar year (Jan 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018 vs July 30,
   2013, to Dec 31, 2015: 21.19, 9.48-47.35). Non-employment (0.35,
   0.14-0.91) and unstable or no housing (vs homeowner 0.13, 0.02-0.95)
   were associated with reduced rates of PrEP initiation after adjustment
   for age. About half of PrEP was obtained via the internet, even after
   the PrEP Impact trial had started (11 {[}48\%] of 23 respondents in
   January to March, 2018).
   Interpretation PrEP awareness and use increased substantially from 2013
   to 2018 among a cohort of MSM in England. Improving access to PrEP by
   routine commissioning by National Health Service England could increase
   PrEP use among all eligible MSM, but should include public health
   strategies to target socioeconomic and demographic disparities in
   knowledge and use of PrEP. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published

Title = {{The relationship of oral health literacy with oral health-related
   quality of life in a multi-racial sample of low-income female caregivers}},
Journal = {{HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: To investigate the association between oral health literacy
   (OHL) and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and explore the
   racial differences therein among a low-income community-based group of
   female WIC participants.
   Methods: Participants (N = 1,405) enrolled in the Carolina Oral Health
   Literacy (COHL) study completed the short form of the Oral Health Impact
   Profile Index (OHIP-14, a measure of OHRQoL) and REALD-30 (a word
   recognition literacy test). Socio-demographic and self-reported dental
   attendance data were collected via structured interviews. Severity
   (cumulative OHIP-14 score) and extent of impact (number of items
   reported fairly/very often) scores were calculated as measures of
   OHRQoL. OHL was assessed by the cumulative REALD-30 score. The
   association of OHL with OHRQoL was examined using descriptive and visual
   methods, and was quantified using Spearman's rho and zero-inflated
   negative binomial modeling.
   Results: The study group included a substantial number of African
   Americans (AA = 41\%) and American Indians (AI = 20\%). The sample
   majority had a high school education or less and a mean age of 26.6
   years. One-third of the participants reported at least one oral health
   impact. The OHIP-14 mean severity and extent scores were 10.6 {[}95\%
   confidence limits (CL) = 10.0, 11.2] and 1.35 (95\% CL = 1.21, 1.50),
   respectively. OHL scores were distributed normally with mean (standard
   deviation, SD) REALD-30 of 15.8 (5.3). OHL was weakly associated with
   OHRQoL: prevalence rho = -0.14 (95\% CL = -0.20, -0.08); extent rho =
   -0.14 (95\% CL = -0.19, -0.09); severity rho = -0.10 (95\% CL = -0.16,
   -0.05). ``Low{''} OHL (defined as < 13 REALD-30 score) was associated
   with worse OHRQoL, with increases in the prevalence of OHIP-14 impacts
   ranging from 11\% for severity to 34\% for extent. The inverse
   association of OHL with OHIP-14 impacts persisted in multivariate
   analysis: Problem Rate Ratio (PRR) = 0.91 (95\% CL = 0.86, 0.98) for one
   SD change in OHL. Stratification by race revealed effect-measure
   modification: Whites-PRR = 1.01 (95\% CL = 0.91, 1.11); AA-PRR = 0.86
   (95\% CL = 0.77, 0.96).
   Conclusions: Although the inverse association between OHL and OHRQoL
   across the entire sample was weak, subjects in the ``low{''} OHL group
   reported significantly more OHRQoL impacts versus those with higher
   literacy. Our findings indicate that the association between OHL and
   OHRQoL may be modified by race.}},

Title = {{Flamingo detection using Marked Point Processes for estimating the size
   of populations}},
Journal = {{TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{95-108}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new technique to automatically detect and
   count breeding Greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) on aerial
   photographs of their colonies. We consider a stochastic approach based
   on marked point processes also called object processes. Here, the
   objects represent flamingos which are defined as ellipses. The Gibbs
   density associated with the marked point process of ellipses is defined
   w.r.t the Poisson measure. Thus, the issue is reduced to an energy
   minimization, where the energy is composed of a regularization term
   (prior density), which introduces some constraints on the objects and
   their interactions, and a data term, which links the objects to the
   features to be extracted in the image. The prior energy is defined as a
   sum of local energies for each object. For a given object o, we consider
   the set S(o) of objects in the current configuration which overlap o. An
   overlapping coefficient between two objects is defined by the
   intersection area normalised by the minimum size between the two
   objects. The local energy, associated to o, is then proportional to the
   maximum overlapping coefficient between o and any element of S(o). The
   data term is also defined by a sum local energies over each object in
   the configuration. The local energy is obtained from the computation of
   a radiometric distance between pixels in the ellipse, modeling the
   flamingo, and pixels in the neighborhood of this ellipse.
   The key parameter to perform the detection is a threshold embedded in
   the data term. The distance computed between pixels in an ellipse and
   pixels in the ellipse neighbordood is mapped to {[}-1,1]. When negative
   (resp. positive) this local energy favours (resp. penalizes) the object
   to belong to the final detection. The sign of this local energy depends
   on a pre-defined threshold. We propose an heuristic to locally estimate
   this threshold. We first estimate a gaussian law to approximate the
   flamingo radiometry in the color space. We compute a weighted color
   histogram of the image. The weight associated to each pixel is
   proportional to a distance computed between pixels in a disk centered on
   the considered pixel and its neighbors. Therefore, the contribution of
   the flamingos in the color histogram is enlarged. We then assume that
   the main mode in the histogram corresponds to flamingos. We estimate the
   distribution of this mode, assuming a gaussian property. The threshold
   is then deduced from the covariance matrix of this mode. We apply this
   procedure locally, on different windows and the threshold map is
   obtained by interpolation. This algorithm provide a locally adaptive
   estimation of the threshold parameter. As a result, the only parameters
   required from the user are some bounding boxes for the ellipse axis.
   These boxes can be deduced from the usual size of flamingos and the data
   resolution.
   Then, we sample the process to extract the configuration of objects,
   minimizing the energy, by a new and fast birth-and-death dynamics,
   leading to the total number of birds. This sampling algorithm is embeded
   into a simulated annealing scheme to optimize the proposed model. A
   birth rate and the temperature of the simulated annealing are
   initialized. After each iteration, these two parameters are decreased
   using a geometrical law.
   Each iteration is divided into three steps. The birth step consists in
   adding a new object on each pixel with a given probability. This
   probability depends on the birth rate but also on a pre-computed birth
   map. To compute this birth map, the data term is evaluated on each pixel
   for a given disk. The probability of adding a new object then depends on
   the data. The choice of the birth map, uniform or depending on the data,
   does not affect the convergence properties. Therefore, the final result
   is the same. But the speed of convergence is increased by using the data
   in the birth process. The goal of the second step is also to speed up
   the convergence. It consists in sorting the objects in the configuration
   with respect to the value of the corresponding data term. In the last
   step, consisting in removing, or killing, some objects in the current
   configuration, we first propose to kill objects having a high value for
   data term. For each object, taken in the data term decreasing order, we
   compute a death probability depending on the energy difference between
   the configuration and the configuration minus the considered object, and
   on the temperature. Note that the birth rate does not depend on the
   temperature, nor the configuration energy. The convergence of this
   algorithm has been proven in a previous work.
   This approach gives counts with good precision compared to manual
   counts. Additionally, this approach does not need any image
   pre-processing or supervision w.r.t. the extraction, thus considerably
   reducing the overall processing time required to get the estimate. Some
   results are shown and compared to the results obtained by an expert.
   Besides, we compare the proposed approach with standard algorithm based
   on template matching and mathematical morphology.}},

Title = {{Interlamellar-induced time-dependent response of intervertebral disc
   annulus: A microstructure-based chemo-viscoelastic model}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{75-91}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc exhibits an unusual
   transversal behavior for which a constitutive representation that
   considers as well regional effect, chemical sensitivity and
   time-dependency has not yet been developed, and it is hence the aim of
   the present contribution. A physically-based model is proposed by
   introducing a free energy function that takes into account the actual
   disc annulus structure in relation with the surrounding biochemical
   environment. The response is assumed to be dominated by the viscoelastic
   contribution of the extracellular matrix, the elastic contribution of
   the oriented collagen fibers and the osmo-induced volumetric
   contribution of the internal fluid content variation. The regional
   dependence of the disc annulus response due to variation in fibers
   content/orientation allows a micromechanical treatment of the soft
   tissue. A finite element model of the annulus specimen is designed while
   taking into consideration the `interlamellar' ground substance zone
   between lamellae of the layered soft tissue. The kinetics is designed
   using full-field strain measurements performed on specimens extracted
   from two disc annulus regions and tested under different osmotic
   conditions. The time-dependency of the tissue response is reported on
   stress-free volumetric changes, on hysteretic stress and transversal
   strains during quasi-static stretching at different strain-rates and on
   their temporal changes during an interrupted stretching. Considering the
   effective contributions of the internal fluid transfer and the
   extracellular matrix viscosity, the microstructure-based
   chemo-mechanical model is found able to successfully reproduce the
   significant features of the macro-response and the unusual transversal
   behavior including the strong regional dependency from inner to outer
   parts of the disc: Poisson's ratio lesser than 0 (auxetic) in lamellae
   plane, higher than 0.5 in fibers plane, and their temporal changes
   towards usual values (between 0 and 0.5) at chemo-mechanical
   equilibrium. The underlying time-dependent mechanisms occurring in the
   tissue are analyzed via the local numerical fields and important
   insights about the effective role of the interlamellar zone are revealed
   for the different disc localizations.
   Statement of significance
   The structural complexity of the annulus fibrosus has only been
   appreciated through recent experimental contributions and a constitutive
   representation that considers as well regional effect, chemical
   sensitivity and time-dependency of the unusual transversal behavior has
   not yet been developed. Here, a microstructure-based chemo-viscoelastic
   model is developed to highlight the interlamellar-induced time-dependent
   response by means of a two-scale strategy. The model provides important
   insights about the origin of the time-dependent phenomena in disc
   annulus along with regional dependency, essential for understanding disc
   functionality. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The problem of determining the extrema of Poisson's ratio for cubic
   crystals is considered, and analytical expressions are derived to
   calculate its extreme values. It follows from the obtained solution
   that, apart from extreme values at standard orientations, extreme values
   of Poisson's ratio can also be detected at special orientations deviated
   from the standard ones. The derived analytical expressions are used to
   calculate the extreme values of Poisson's ratio for a large number of
   known cubic crystals. The extremely high values of Poisson's ratio are
   shown to be characteristic of metastable crystals, such as crystals with
   the shape memory effect caused by martensitic transformation. These
   crystals are mainly represented by metallic alloys. For some crystals,
   the absolute extrema of Poisson's ratio can exceed the standard values,
   which are-1 for a standard minimum and +2 for a standard maximum.}},

Abstract = {{An electrodynamics-based model was formulated for simulation of ion
   diffusion in microbial polysaccharides. The fixed charges and
   electrostatic double layers that may associate with microbial
   polysaccharides and their effects on ion diffusion were explicitly built
   into the model. The model extends a common multicomponent ion diffusion
   formulation that is based on irreversible thermodynamics under a zero
   ionic charge flux condition, which is only applicable to the regions
   without fixed charges and electrostatic double layers. An efficient
   numerical procedure was presented to solve the differential equations in
   the model. The model well described key features of experimental
   observations of ion diffusion in negatively charged microbial
   polysaccharides including accelerated diffusive transport of cations,
   exclusion of anions, and increased rate of cation transport with
   increasing negative charge density. The simulated diffusive fluxes of
   cations and anions were consistent with a cation exchange diffusion
   concept in negatively charged polysaccharides at the interface of plant
   roots and soils; and the developed model allows to mathematically study
   such diffusion phenomena. An illustrative example was also provided to
   simulate dynamic behavior of ionic current during ion diffusion within a
   charged bacterial cell wall polysaccharide and the effects of the ionic
   current on the compression or expansion of the bacterial electrostatic
   double layer at the interface of the cell wall and bulk solution. (C)

Title = {{HIV Shedding from Male Circumcision Wounds in HIV-Infected Men: A
   Prospective Cohort Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background
   A randomized trial of voluntary medical male circumcision (MC) of
   HIV-infected men reported increased HIV transmission to female partners
   among men who resumed sexual intercourse prior to wound healing. We
   conducted a prospective observational study to assess penile HIV
   shedding after MC.
   Methods and Findings
   HIV shedding was evaluated among 223 HIV-infected men (183 self-reported
   not receiving antiretroviral therapy {[}ART], 11 self-reported receiving
   ART and had a detectable plasma viral load {[}VL], and 29 self-reported
   receiving ART and had an undetectable plasma VL {[}< 400 copies/ml]) in
   Rakai, Uganda, between June 2009 and April 2012. Preoperative and weekly
   penile lavages collected for 6 wk and then at 12 wk were tested for HIV
   shedding and VL using a real-time quantitative PCR assay. Unadjusted
   prevalence risk ratios (PRRs) and adjusted PRRs (adjPRRs) of HIV
   shedding were estimated using modified Poisson regression with robust
   variance. HIV shedding was detected in 9.3\% (17/183) of men not on ART
   prior to surgery and 39.3\% (72/183) of these men during the entire
   study. Relative to baseline, the proportion shedding was significantly
   increased after MC at 1 wk (PRR = 1.87, 95\% CI = 1.12-3.14, p = 0.012),
   2 wk (PRR = 3.16, 95\% CI = 1.94-5.13, p < 0.001), and 3 wk (PRR = 1.98,
   95\% CI = 1.19-3.28, p = 0.008) after MC. However, compared to baseline,
   HIV shedding was decreased by 6 wk after MC (PRR = 0.27, 95\% CI =
   0.09-0.83, p = 0.023) and remained suppressed at 12 wk after MC (PRR =
   0.19, 95\% CI = 0.06-0.64, p = 0.008). Detectable HIV shedding from MC
   wounds occurred in more study visits among men with an HIV plasma VL >
   50,000 copies/ml than among those with an HIV plasma VL < 400 copies/ml
   (adjPRR = 10.3, 95\% CI = 4.25-24.90, p < 0.001). Detectable HIV
   shedding was less common in visits from men with healed MC wounds
   compared to visits from men without healed wounds (adjPRR = 0.12, 95\%
   CI = 0.07-0.23, p < 0.001) and in visits from men on ART with
   undetectable plasma VL compared to men not on ART (PRR = 0.15, 95\% CI =
   0.05-0.43, p = 0.001). Among men with detectable penile HIV shedding,
   the median log(10) HIV copies/milliliter of lavage fluid was
   significantly lower in men with ART-induced undetectable plasma VL
   (1.93, interquartile range {[}IQR] = 1.83-2.14) than in men not on ART
   (2.63, IQR = 2.28-3.22, p < 0.001). Limitations of this observational
   study include significant differences in baseline covariates, lack of
   confirmed receipt of ART for individuals who reported ART use, and lack
   of information on potential ART initiation during follow-up for those
   who were not on ART at enrollment.
   Conclusion
   Penile HIV shedding is significantly reduced after healing of MC wounds.
   Lower plasma VL is associated with decreased frequency and quantity of
   HIV shedding from MC wounds. Starting ART prior to MC should be
   considered to reduce male-to-female HIV transmission risk. Research is
   needed to assess the time on ART required to decrease shedding, and the
   acceptability and feasibility of initiating ART at the time of MC.}},

Title = {{Impact of providing free HIV self-testing kits on frequency of testing
   among men who have sex with men and their sexual partners in China: A
   randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{PLOS MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   The HIV epidemic is rapidly growing among men who have sex with men
   (MSM) in China, yet HIV testing remains suboptimal. We aimed to
   determine the impact of HIV self-testing (HIVST) interventions on
   frequency of HIV testing among Chinese MSM and their sexual partners.
   Methods and findings
   This randomized controlled trial was conducted in 4 cities in Hunan
   Province, China. Sexually active and HIV-negative MSM were recruited
   from communities and randomly assigned (1:1) to intervention or control
   arms. Participants in the control arm had access to site-based HIV
   testing (SBHT); those in the intervention arm were provided with 2 free
   finger-prick-based HIVST kits at enrollment and could receive 2 to 4
   kits delivered through express mail every 3 months for 1 year in
   addition to SBHT. They were encouraged to distribute HIVST kits to their
   sexual partners. The primary outcome was the number of HIV tests taken
   by MSM participants, and the secondary outcome was the number of HIV
   tests taken by their sexual partners during 12 months of follow-up. The
   effect size for the primary and secondary outcomes was evaluated as the
   standardized mean difference (SMD) in testing frequency between
   intervention and control arms.
   Between April 14, 2018, and June 30, 2018, 230 MSM were recruited. Mean
   age was 29 years; 77\% attended college; 75\% were single. The analysis
   population who completed at least one follow-up questionnaire included
   110 (93\%, 110/118) in the intervention and 106 (95\%, 106/112) in the
   control arm. The average frequency of HIV tests per participant in the
   intervention arm (3.75) was higher than that in the control arm (1.80;
   SMD 1.26; 95\% CI 0.97-1.55; P< 0.001). This difference was mainly due
   to the difference in HIVST between the 2 arms (intervention 2.18 versus
   control 0.41; SMD 1.30; 95\% CI 1.01-1.59; P< 0.001), whereas the
   average frequency of SBHT was comparable (1.57 versus 1.40, SMD 0.14;
   95\% CI -0.13 to 0.40; P = 0.519). The average frequency of HIV tests
   among sexual partners of each participant was higher in intervention
   than control arm (2.65 versus 1.31; SMD 0.64; 95\% CI 0.36-0.92; P<
   0.001), and this difference was also due to the difference in HIVST
   between the 2 arms (intervention 1.41 versus control 0.36; SMD 0.75;
   95\% CI 0.47-1.04;P< 0.001) but not SBHT (1.24 versus 0.96; SMD 0.23;
   95\% CI -0.05 to 0.50;P= 0.055). Zero-inflated Poisson regression
   analyses showed that the likelihood of taking HIV testing among
   intervention participants were 2.1 times greater than that of control
   participants (adjusted rate ratio {[}RR] 2.10; 95\% CI 1.75-2.53,P<
   0.001), and their sexual partners were 1.55 times more likely to take
   HIV tests in the intervention arm compared with the control arm (1.55,
   1.23-1.95,P< 0.001). During the study period, 3 participants in the
   intervention arm and none in the control arm tested HIV positive, and 8
   sexual partners of intervention arm participants also tested positive.
   No other adverse events were reported. Limitations in this study
   included the data on number of SBHT were solely based on self-report by
   the participants, but self-reported number of HIVST in the intervention
   arm was validated; the number of partner HIV testing was indirectly
   reported by participants because of difficulties in accessing each of

Title = {{In-vitro fragmentation of ovarian tissue activates primordial follicles
   through the Hippo pathway}},
Journal = {{HUMAN REPRODUCTION OPEN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{STUDY QUESTION: What is the role of the Hippo and PI3K/Akt pathway in
   follicles during ovarian tissue culture in tissue derived from
   oncological patients and transgender men?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: Results highlight a Hippo pathway driven primordial
   follicle activation in vitro, predominantly from Day 0 to Day 4.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In-vitro ovarian tissue culture aims at
   activating and maturing primordial follicles for fertility restoration
   in patients with a threatened ovarian reserve. Not all patients are
   eligible for ovarian cortex transplantation and therefore several groups
   are attempting to culture ovarian tissue in-vitro. Cortex fragmentation
   disrupts the Hippo pathway, leading to increased expression of
   downstream growth factors and follicle growth. The PI3K/Akt pathway is
   considered the intracellular pathway to where different extracellular
   factors involved in primordial follicle activation in-vivo converge. In
   order to optimise current ovarian tissue culture models, information on
   progression of these pathways during tissue culture is mandatory.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The first step of a multistep cortex
   culture system was performed using 144 ovarian cortex pieces from a
   total of six patients. Per patient, 24 cortical strips were cultured for
   6 days and six pieces per patient were collected for downstream analysis
   of follicle development and Hippo and PI3K/Akt pathway targets every
   second day.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Ovarian tissue was obtained
   from oncological (N = 3; 28.67 +/- 4.51 years) and transgender (N = 3;
   23.33 +/- 1.53 years) patients. Follicles were analysed using
   haematoxylin-eosin staining and pathways were studied using
   immunohistochemistry and precise follicle excision by laser capture
   micro-dissection for RT-qPCR analysis. MIQE guidelines for RT-qPCR were
   pursued. Reference gene selection (GAPDH, RPL3A, 18s rRNA) was performed
   using GeNorm Reference Gene Selection Kit. Statistical analysis was
   conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics 23 (Poisson regression, negative
   binomial regression, ANOVA and paired t-test).
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Immunohistochemical analysis
   confirmed a Hippo pathway driven primordial follicle activation due to
   mechanical manipulation of the cortical strips. Ovarian tissue
   preparation and culture induced the inhibitory phosphorylated
   Yes-associated protein (pYAP) to disappear in granulosa cells of
   primordial follicles on Day 2. The stimulatory YAP on the contrary
   appeared in primordial granulosa cells over increasing culture days.
   Looking at the YAP target connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a
   significantly up-regulated CTGF was noted in primordial follicles when
   comparing Day 2 and Day 4 (ratio Day 2/4 = 0.082; P < 0.05), clearly
   showing an effect on the Hippo pathway in primordial follicles during
   tissue culture. Follicle classification showed a significant drop in
   estimated primordial follicle counts in the oncological cohort ( -78\%;
   P = 0.021) on Day 2 and in the transgender cohort on Day 4 (-634\%; P =
   0.008). Intermediate follicle counts showed a non-significant increasing
   trend to during culture and this follicle recruitment and growth
   resulted in a significant rise in estimated primary follicle counts on
   Day 6 in oncological patients (170\%; P = 0.025) and, although limited
   in absolute numbers, a significant increase in secondary follicles on
   Day 4 (367\%; P = 0.021) in the transgender cohort. Subsequent antral
   follicle development could not be observed.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: A limitation is the small sample size,
   inherent to this study subject, especially as a large amount of tissue
   was needed per patient to reduce inter-patient variation in different
   downstream analysis techniques. A particular and specific weakness of
   this study is the inability to include an age-matched control group.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings support an adapted
   tissue preparation for Hippo pathway disruption and a shorter first
   phase of tissue culture. This work may also have implications for
   transplantation of cryopreserved tissue as larger strips (and thus
   slower burnout due to less Hippo pathway disruption) could be a benefit.}},

Abstract = {{Question Can a prediction model be constructed for retinopathy of
   prematurity needing treatment by using only birth characteristics data
   and applying advanced statistical methods? Findings In this cohort study
   of 6947 infants born at gestational age 24 to 30 weeks, the prediction
   model incorporating only postnatal age, gestational age, sex, and birth
   weight provided a predictive ability for retinopathy of prematurity
   needing treatment that was comparable to current models requiring
   postnatal data (not always available). The risk for retinopathy of
   prematurity needing treatment increased up to 12 weeks' postnatal age
   irrespective of the infants' gestational age. Meaning This prediction
   model identifying infants with a high risk for developing
   sight-threatening disease at an early time may improve the conditions
   for optimal screening.
   This cohort study creates and validates an easy-to-use prediction model
   using only birth characteristics and describes a continuous hazard
   function for retinopathy of prematurity treatment.
   Importance To prevent blindness, repeated infant eye examinations are
   performed to detect severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), yet only a
   small fraction of those screened need treatment. Early individual risk
   stratification would improve screening timing and efficiency and
   potentially reduce the risk of blindness. Objectives To create and
   validate an easy-to-use prediction model using only birth
   characteristics and to describe a continuous hazard function for ROP
   treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants In this retrospective
   cohort study, Swedish National Patient Registry data from infants
   screened for ROP (born between January 1, 2007, and August 7, 2018) were
   analyzed with Poisson regression for time-varying data (postnatal age,
   gestational age {[}GA], sex, birth weight, and important interactions)
   to develop an individualized predictive model for ROP treatment (called
   DIGIROP-Birth {[}Digital ROP]). The model was validated internally and
   externally (in US and European cohorts) and compared with 4 published
   prediction models. Main Outcomes and Measures The study outcome was ROP
   treatment. The measures were estimated momentary and cumulative risks,
   hazard ratios with 95\% CIs, area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve (hereinafter referred to as AUC), sensitivity,
   specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive
   value (NPV). Results Among 7609 infants (54.6\% boys; mean {[}SD] GA,
   28.1 {[}2.1] weeks; mean {[}SD] birth weight, 1119 {[}353] g), 442
   (5.8\%) were treated for ROP, including 142 (40.1\%) treated of 354 born
   at less than 24 gestational weeks. Irrespective of GA, the risk for
   receiving ROP treatment increased during postnatal weeks 8 through 12
   and decreased thereafter. Validations of DIGIROP-Birth for 24 to 30
   weeks' GA showed high predictive ability for the model overall (AUC,
   0.90 {[}95\% CI, 0.89-0.92] for internal validation, 0.94 {[}95\% CI,
   0.90-0.98] for temporal validation, 0.87 {[}95\% CI, 0.84-0.89] for US
   external validation, and 0.90 {[}95\% CI, 0.85-0.95] for European
   external validation) by calendar periods and by race/ethnicity. The
   sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were numerically at least as high
   as those obtained from CHOP-ROP (Children's Hospital of
   Philadelphia-ROP), OMA-ROP (Omaha-ROP), WINROP (weight, insulinlike
   growth factor 1, neonatal, ROP), and CO-ROP (Colorado-ROP), models
   requiring more complex postnatal data. Conclusions and Relevance This
   study validated an individualized prediction model for infants born at
   24 to 30 weeks' GA, enabling early risk prediction of ROP treatment
   based on birth characteristics data. Postnatal age rather than
   postmenstrual age was a better predictive variable for the temporal risk
   of ROP treatment. The model is an accessible online application that
   appears to be generalizable and to have at least as good test statistics
   as other models requiring longitudinal neonatal data not always readily
   available to ophthalmologists.}},

Abstract = {{We have further explored the final stages of the collapse of an unstable
   cavity or bubble using the Molecular Dynamics computer simulation
   technique. A nanometre sized spherical volume of molecules was removed
   from a bulk Lennard-Jones liquid, which being mechanically and
   thermodynamically unstable, proceeded to collapse. The molecules with
   the highest kinetic energy were the first to enter the initially empty
   cavity. The temperature of individual molecules inside the cavity, while
   the density was still typical of a gas, could reach at least an order of
   magnitude larger than that of the surrounding liquid, e.g., equivalent
   to 6, 000 K for water, which is not unreasonable for the
   sonoluminescence effect to be seen. During the filling in of the cavity,
   the average temperature decreased, as the contents thermally
   equilibrated with the surrounding liquid. The bubble partially filled
   in, and then proceeded to partially empty again, and so on in an
   oscillatory manner, with ever decreasing amplitude towards the final
   uniform liquid state. This,recoil' effect is predicted by classical
   hydrodynamic treatments and has been observed in experiment for much
   larger bubbles. The temperature, density and normal pressure component
   were resolved as a function of radius from the centre of the bubble at
   selected times during the collapsing process. The simulations support
   the view that MD can provide a realistic representation of the final
   stages of cavity collapse. It does not make assumptions about equation
   of state and transport coefficients as would be required for a
   comparable solution of the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics equations, and is
   therefore an especially appropriate description for the final stages of
   the collapse. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature dependence of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectra of
   magnetic nanoparticles or agglomerates of gamma-Fe2O3 in nonmagnetic
   matrixes has been studied. Samples with two types of magnetic
   nanofillers have been studied: a solid powder and a suspension. Magnetic
   anisotropy present in the samples allowed analysis of the observed FMR
   spectrum in terms of two lines arising from the perpendicular (the more
   intense) and parallel (the weaker) components of the resulting dipolar
   field. It was observed that the temperature changes of the resonance
   lines have been effected by the presence of critical phenomena in
   polymer matrix, especially the freezing processes connected with the
   arrested movements of certain matrix fragments. A simple model has been
   put forward to explain partially the shift of the resonance field with
   the temperature change. It is proposed that an essential part (50\%) of
   the temperature shift of the position of FMR resonance could be caused
   by change of an effective magnetic moment due to thermal expansion of
   the matrix. Application of low concentration of magnetic nanoparticles
   in the polymeric systems, especially possessing extraordinary physical
   properties, would allow studying them by the FMR method. This might be
   very helpful for understanding of the critical or exotic phenomena
   observed in certain materials. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Title = {{Heterogeneous Strain Distribution of Elastomer Substrates To Enhance the
   Sensitivity of Stretchable Strain Sensors}},
Journal = {{ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{82-90}},

Abstract = {{Stretchable strain sensors, which convert mechanical stimuli into
   electrical signals, largely fuel the growth of wearable bioelectronics
   due to the ubiquitous, health-related strain in biological systems. In
   contrast to rigid conventional strain sensors, stretchable strain
   sensors present advantages of conformality and stretchability, solving
   the mechanical mismatch between electronics and the human body. However,
   the great challenge of stretchable strain sensors lies in achieving high
   sensitivity, which is required for both signal fidelity and cost
   considerations. Recent advances to solve this sensitivity challenge have
   focused on material optimization, in search of the optimum combination
   of conductive active materials and elastomer substrates among a myriad
   of artificial or natural materials. However, high sensitivity with a
   gauge factor larger than 50 remains a grand challenge, especially within
   large-strain regions.
   Here we present heterogeneous strain distribution of elastomer
   substrates as a powerful strategy to significantly enhance the
   sensitivity of stretchable strain sensors. The theoretical foundation of
   this strategy is mathematically proven on the basis of Ohm's law in
   electrics and mechanics of materials. First, the extent of the
   sensitivity enhancement is proved to be determined by the local strain
   in resistance-testing segments of heterogeneous strain sensors. Next,
   the local strain is proved to be quantitatively decided by material
   properties such as section area and Young's modulus. Thus, the necessary
   and sufficient condition to achieve high sensitivity in heterogeneous
   strain sensors is that the Young's modulus reciprocal or section area
   reciprocal in the resistance-testing segment is larger than the mean
   value. This provides a theoretical design guideline to achieve high
   sensitivity via heterogeneous strain distribution.
   On the basis of this guideline, we systematically summarize concrete
   instances of heterogeneity-induced sensitivity improvement in
   stretchable strain sensors, in sequence of increasing dimensionality. A
   typical example of a one-dimensional heterogeneous strain sensor is a
   structured fiber with microbeads, where the varied section area along
   the fiber axis results in heterogeneous strain and sensitivity
   improvement. Two-dimensional heterogeneous sensors in the form of thin
   films contain thickness gradient sensors and auxetic mechanical
   metamaterial sensors. The former exhibit heterogeneous section area via
   the self-pinning method, while the latter show heterogeneity in both the
   strain direction and amplitude, leading to a 24-fold improvement in
   sensitivity. Three-dimensional strain sensors include rationally
   structured sensors for out-of-plane force detection and asymmetric
   active materials in electronic whiskers. The resultant enhanced
   sensitivity in these heterogeneous strain sensors is beneficial for
   applications such as continuous health monitoring, biomedical
   diagnostics, and replacement prosthetics, taking advantage of augmented
   detection accuracy and declined device cost. Finally, we discuss
   possible future work in exploiting heterogeneous strain distributions,
   involving extended methodology to achieve heterogeneity, employing
   suppressed strain for stretchable electrodes, cyclic durability for
   long-term applications, and multifunctional system-level integration. We
   believe that this strategy of using heterogeneous strain distribution to
   enhance sensitivity can strongly promote the development of stretchable
   strain sensors for both practical and theoretical requirements.}},

Title = {{Predictive model of BEC dark matter halos with a solitonic core and an

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},

Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{We develop a model of Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter halos with a
   solitonic core and an isothermal atmosphere based on a generalized
   Gross-Pitaevskii equation {[}P. H. Chavanis, Eur. Phys. J. Plus 132, 248
   (2017)]. This equation provides a heuristic coarse-grained
   parametrization of the ordinary GrossPitaevskii equation accounting for
   violent relaxation and gravitational cooling. It involves a cubic
   nonlinearity taking into account the self-interaction of the bosons, a
   logarithmic nonlinearity associated with an effective temperature, and a
   source of dissipation. It leads to superfluid dark matter halos with a
   core-halo structure. The quantum potential or the self-interaction of
   the bosons generates a solitonic core that solves the cusp problem of
   the cold dark matter model. The logarithmic nonlinearity generates an
   isothermal atmosphere accounting for the flat rotation curves of the
   galaxies. The dissipation ensures that the system relaxes towards an
   equilibrium configuration. In the Thomas-Fermi approximation, a dark
   matter halo is equivalent to a barotropic gas with an equation of state
   P = 2 pi a(s)h(2)/rho(2)m(3)+ pk(B)T/m, where a(s) is the scattering
   length of the bosons and m is their individual mass. We numerically
   solve the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and determine the density
   profiles and rotation curves of dark matter halos. We impose that the
   surface density of the halos has the universal value Sigma(0)
   =rho(0)r(h) = 141 M-circle dot/pc(2) obtained from the observations. For
   a boson with ratio a(s)/m(3) = 3.28 x 10(3) fm/(eV/c(2))(3), we find a
   minimum halo mass (M-h)(min) = 1.86 x 10(8) M-circle dot and a minimum
   halo radius (r(h))(min) = 788 pc. This ultracompact halo corresponds to
   a pure soliton which is the ground state of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson
   equation. For (M-h)(min) h, < (M-h), = 3.30 x 10(9) M circle dot the
   soliton is surrounded by a tenuous isothermal atmosphere. For M-h >
   (M-h)(c) we find two branches of solutions corresponding to (i) purely
   isothermal halos without soliton and (ii) isothermal halos harboring a
   central soliton. The purely isothermal halos (gaseous phase) are stable.
   For M-h> (M-h)(c) = 6.86 x 10(10) M-circle dot they arc
   indistinguishable from the observational Burkert profile. For (M-h) {*}
   < M-h < (M-h)(c), the deviation from the isothermal law (most probable
   state) may be explained by incomplete violent relaxation, tidal effects,
   or stochastic forcing. The isothermal halos harboring a central soliton
   (core-halo phase) are canonically unstable (having a negative specific
   heat) but they are microcanonically stable so they are long-lived. By
   extremizing the free energy with respect to the core mass, we find that
   the core mass scales as M-c/(M-h)(min) = 0.626(M-h/(M-h)(min))(1/2)
   In(M-h/(M-h)(min)). For a halo of mass M-h= 10(12) M-circle dot, similar
   to the mass of the dark matter halo that surrounds our Galaxy, the
   solitonic core has a mass M-c= 6.39 x 10(10) M-circle dot and a radius
   R-c = 1 kpc.
   The solitonic core cannot mimic by itself a supermassive black hole at
   the center of the Galaxy but it may represent a large bulge which is
   either present now or may have, in the past, triggered the collapse of
   the surrounding gas, leading to a supermassive black hole and a quasiu.
   On the other hand, we argue that large halos with a mass M-h > 10(12)
   M-circle dot may undergo a gravothermal catastrophe leading ultimately
   to the formation of a supermassive black hole (for smaller halos, the
   gravothermal catastrophe is inhibited by quantum effects). We relate the
   bifurcation point and the point above which supermassive black holes may
   form to the canonical and microcanonical critical points (M-h)(CCP) =
   3.27 x 10(9) M-circle dot and (M-h)(MCP) similar to 2 x 10(12) M-circle
   dot of the ``thermal{''} self-gravitating bosonic gas. Our model has no
   free parameter so it is completely predictive. Extension of this model
   to noninteracting bosons and fermions will be presented in forthcoming
   papers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the flat-wise compression behavior of an
   innovative cellular structure configuration. The considered layout has a
   hexagonal chiral geometry featuring cylinders, or nodes, joined by
   ligaments, or ribs. The resulting assembly is characterized by a number
   of interesting properties that can be exploited for the design of
   alternative honeycombs or cellular topologies to be used in sandwich
   construction. The flat-wise strength of the chiral geometry is
   investigated through classical analytical formulas for the linear
   buckling of thin plates and shells and a bifurcation analysis performed
   on a Finite Element model. The analytical expressions predict the global
   buckling behavior and the resulting critical loads, and can be directly
   compared with the results obtained from the Finite Element analysis. In
   addition, the Finite Element model predicts local buckling. modes, which
   should be considered to evaluate the possible development of localized
   plasticity. A sensitivity study is performed to evaluate the influence
   of the geometry of the chiral structure on its buckling strength. The
   study shows that the considered topology can offer great design
   flexibility, whereby several parameters can be-selected and modified to
   improve the flat-wise performance. The comparison with traditional,
   hexagonal centro-symmetric structural configurations concludes the paper
   and demonstrates the enhanced performance and the potentials of chiral

   provides an improved understanding of how particulate composites, with

Abstract = {{Structure and swelling dynamics of ultrathin films of CdS-polyacrylamide
   nanocomposite material were studied using gravimetric techniques and
   X-ray reflectivity. Ultrathin films of the polymer and the nanocomposite
   were coated on hydrophilic Si(100) substrate using spin coating. The
   thickness of the composite films vary non-monotonically with spinning
   speed and were found to lie in discrete ``bands{''} of thicknesses
   separated by ``forbidden regions{''} unlike pure polymer films. Modified
   internal structure of the coils due to polymer-particle interaction was
   found to play a significant role in describing the novel features of the
   nanocomposite films. To study the mass uptake, the films were exposed to
   the H2O vapour and the weights of the films were recorded as functions
   of exposure time. The observed non-Fickian transport was explained in
   terms of alignment of free volume due to confinement of restricted
   polymer chains. To study swelling dynamics, the films were exposed to
   the H2O vapour and X-ray reflectivity scans were collected as functions
   of exposure time. The swelling dynamics of the nanocomposite films were
   explained in terms of a model which takes into account the
   polymer-particle interaction. A fraction of polymer segments that are in
   direct contact with the nanoparticles observed slower dynamics as
   compared to the free chain swelling. Larger values of excluded volume
   parameters corresponding to restricted segments as compared to the free
   segments were explained in terms of enhancement of monomer-monomer
   interaction through particle attachment. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH

   relaxation (annealing) process observed in bulk and responsible partly
   for the reported apparent negative expansivity. In addition, we found
   extremely slow re-expansion process in the glassy state. The ultra-slow
   contraction and re-expansion have been assigned to the lateral expansion
   and contraction of the film, respectively. Using well-annealed films, we
   have evaluated thermal expansivity as a function of film thickness, and
   found that it decreases with film thickness in a thickness range below
   twice of radius of gyration of a polymer chain 2R(g), in the glassy

   constant due to confinement in a thin film. This idea was confirmed in

   The composite consists of matrix material and a stack of inclusions. The

   inclusions, the global structure exhibits unusual properties over a wide

Pages = {{999+}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Kirigami tessellations, regular planar patterns formed by partially
   cutting flat, thin sheets, allow compact shapes to morph into open
   structures with rich geometries and unusual material properties.
   However, geometric and topological constraints make the design of such
   structures challenging. Here we pose and solve the inverse problem of
   determining the number, size and orientation of cuts that enables the
   deployment of a closed, compact regular kirigami tessellation to conform
   approximately to any prescribed target shape in two or three dimensions.
   We first identify the constraints on the lengths and angles of
   generalized kirigami tessellations that guarantee that their
   reconfigured face geometries can be contracted from a non-trivial
   deployed shape to a compact, non-overlapping planar cut pattern. We then
   encode these conditions into a flexible constrained optimization
   framework to obtain generalized kirigami patterns derived from various
   periodic tesselations of the plane that can be deployed into a wide
   variety of prescribed shapes. A simple mechanical analysis of the
   resulting structure allows us to determine and control the stability of
   the deployed state and control the deployment path. Finally, we
   fabricate physical models that deploy in two and three dimensions to
   validate this inverse design approach. Altogether, our approach,
   combining geometry, topology and optimization, highlights the potential
   for generalized kirigami tessellations as building blocks for
   shape-morphing mechanical metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{This study seeks to develop novel multi-material and multi-layer pads
   that are comfortable to wear and effective in protecting body parts that
   are subject to blunt impact. The proposed body protection pad will
   address a safety issue prominent in elderly people, industry workers,
   law enforcement/military personnel, and sport players. Among the
   population of those people, blunt impact due to various causes such as
   falls, bullets, and blast waves reduce quality of life, increase the
   possibility of early death, and cause extremely high medical costs to
   incur. Protector pads represent a promising strategy for reducing impact
   force and preventing injuries in high risk individuals. However,
   clinical efficacy has been limited by poor user compliance. Currently
   available protectors are made of either hard shells or soft thick pads.
   Some of them are made of Non-Newtonian materials that are believed to be
   very efficient but their effectiveness hasn't been proved yet. Even
   though some available protectors can be effective if worn, most people
   who need protection are reluctant to wear bulky and heavy garments or
   rigid shells. Therefore, it is important to develop new body protectors
   that best combine each individual's requirements of wearing comfort
   (flexible, light weight), ease of fitting (customized), ensured
   protection, and cost-effectiveness.
   The authors brought up many different design ideas and the most
   promising ones were selected and their effectiveness is investigated in
   detail. One of those pads utilizes dome shape top layer and thin fabric
   membrane component, such as Kevlar, that is very strong in tension but
   flexible in bending. Such design will make the pads excellent in
   dissipating shock energy and converting normal shock force to lateral
   direction to minimize the shock force transmitted to the body parts.
   Through computational simulations, these pads were proved to be very
   flexible in bending and torsion while strong and rigid in compression.
   In addition, suitable materials were identified, and it has been
   verified that such materials can be used to design a viable product(s)
   that is thin, light, and flexible for wearing comfort but strong in
   normal impact direction to protect the body.
   This paper reports a parametric study using computational analyses
   (finite element analyses) conducted for dome-shaped structures with
   various materials such as thermoplastic polyurethane (Ninjaflex (R) and
   Semiflex (R)), polyethylene, resin polyester, polylactic acid (PLA),
   resin epoxy, epoxy S glass, and epoxy E-glass. Parametric 3D CAD models
   of the dome-shape structures were created with various combinations of
   layers such as dome shell only, dome with fabric (such as Kevlar)
   membrane, dome with fabric membrane and solid filler, and dome with
   fillers of auxetic structure. Then, key structural characteristics of
   protectors such as normal (compression), bending, and torsional
   stiffness were evaluated through static analyses of FEA models. Then,
   impact/shock analyses were conducted using multiphysics finite-element
   analysis models to validate the results obtained from the static
   analyses. Advanced additive manufacturing techniques (3D printers) were
   used to build prototypes of the pads for tests. Dimensions and materials
   of the multi layer pads are optimized for light weight and flexibility
   while keeping excellent shock absorption capability. The mechanism for
   ideal input force distribution or shunting are explained and suggested
   for designing protectors using various combinations of materials and
   layers to reduce the risk of injury. The results show that the dome
   shape structure can be an effective component of optimized body
   protection pads using a combination of various materials.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the variability of the shear modulus of hexagonal
   crystals was studied. Analytic expressions for the extreme values of the

   hexagonal crystals was given on the basis of experimental data from the

   and minimum values of the shear modulus was found for a layered crystal
   - graphite. A large difference between maximum and minimum is also
   characteristic for molybdenum disulphide. Classification scheme is
   proposed for the extreme values of shear modulus for hexagonal crystals

Title = {{Parametric Structural Optimization of 2D Complex Shape Based on
   Isogeometric Analysis}},
Journal = {{CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING \& SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{124}},

Pages = {{203-225}},
Abstract = {{The geometric model and the analysis model can be uni fied together
   through the isogeometric analysis method, which has potential to achieve
   seam- less integration of CAD and CAE. Parametric design is a mainstream
   and success- ful method in CAD field. This method is not continued in
   simulation and optimization stage because of the model conversion in
   conventional optimization method based on the finite element analysis.
   So integration of the parametric mod- eling and the structural
   optimization by using isogeometric analysis is a natural and interesting
   issue. This paper proposed a method to realize a structural optimi-
   zation of parametric complex shapes by using isogeometric analysis. By
   the given feature curves and the constraints, a feature frame model is
   built. Based on the feature frame model, a parametric representation of
   complex shape is obtained. After adding some auxiliary curves, the
   feature frame model is divided into many box -like patches in three
   dimension or four-sided patches in two dimension. These patches are
   built into parametric patches by using volume interpolation methods such
   as Coons method. Based on the parametric patches, isogeometic analysis
   is applied. Thus, the relationships are constructed among the size para-
   meters, the control points and the physical performance parameters. Then
   the sen- sitivity matrix could be derived based on the relationships.
   The size optimization is carried out in the first stage by taking the
   size parameters as variables. Based on the result of size optimization,
   shape optimization with the constraints of stress is carried out in the
   second stage by taking the control points as variables. Serval planar
   complex shapes are taken as example to verify our method. The results
   ver- ify that the parametric modeling and structural optimization can be
   united together without model conversion. Bene fit from this, the
   optimization design can be exe- cuted as a dark box operation without
   considering the concrete modeling and ana- lysis by input of the sizes,
   constraints and loads.}},

   theories are usually valid for waves with wavelength much larger than

   relations, it is demonstrated that in contrast to the single-field
   continuum theory constructed in our previous paper the multi-field
   generalization is valid not only for long but also for short waves. We
   show that the multi-field model can be used to describe spatially
   localized short- and long-wavelength distortions. Short-wave external
   fields of forces and torques can be also naturally taken into account by
   the multi-field continuum theory. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Elastic meta-materials or meta-composites can be designed to have a
   negative effective mass density at certain vibration frequencies, thus
   blocking wave propagation through the material within that frequency
   band. The negative mass behaviour is generated by resonant structures
   within the material that oscillate 180 degrees out of phase with the
   acoustic pressure waves applied to the surface. As this research is in
   its initial stages this paper describes work in progress in both the
   experimental and numerical domains, and some early results from solids
   containing geometrically, simple spring-mass resonant structures.
   Behaviour is characterized experimentally by dynamic tests of individual
   resonators as well as impedance tube measurements of panel-like
   structures containing multiple resonant elements. The experimental
   results exhibit clear evidence of the expected resonances, and partial
   band gap behaviour. Finite element models of both single resonant
   elements and impedance tube specimens are being developed, and the
   current status of these models is described. Their results to date show
   good agreement with the mass law and qualitative agreement with the

Abstract = {{Stress-strain results are reported for two series of smectic C main
   chain liquid crystalline elastomers (MCLCEs). The structural variable in
   one series is crosslink density; in the other, transverse rod content.
   With increasing crosslinker content, the LCEs exhibit increased modulus,
   a shorter polydomain-to-monodomain (P=M) plateau, and a lower elongation
   at break. Increasing transverse rod content leads to lower clearing
   temperatures and lower modulus. For each series, stress-strain
   measurement was made simultaneously with Poisson's ratio determination.
   For the variable crosslinker series, typical behavior showed the
   Poisson's ratio increased at small strain, rose to a maximum about 50\%
   strain, then decreased with greater strain. For the transverse rod
   series, typical behavior also showed the Poisson's ratio increased at
   small strain, rose to a maximum about 50\% strain, then decreased with
   greater strain. In both series, the maximum in the Poisson's ratio
   corresponded to the onset of the P=M transition. Possible deformation

Abstract = {{Kinematic motion structures having a reconfigurable property appear to
   be a potential candidate for the programmable matter. Motion structures
   with N-fold rotational symmetry show a reconfigurable pattern
   transformation, resulting in providing tunable mechanical properties,
   which deserves to explore more for their unique properties of
   transformation and the corresponding structural behaviors. The objective
   of this work is to synthesize motion structures from a bar-and-joint
   framework, investigating their transformability, linear structural
   properties- modulus and Poisson's ratio, and nonlinear structural
   behaviors with kinematic bifurcation. Two-dimensional (2D) motion
   structures are synthesized by central scissor links with revolute
   joints, connected with binary links in the radial direction. They
   possess an N-fold rotational symmetry (MS-N), and their transformed
   patterns are investigated. Five 2D motion structures- MS-4, MS-6, MS-8,
   MS-10, and MS-12, are generated for investigating their mechanical
   properties together with their transformability. Analytical models of
   the motion structures are constructed for obtaining relative density,
   moduli, Poisson's ratios, volume at each transformed state, and the
   strain energy required to transform from one state to another. This
   study integrates kinematics and structural mechanics, expanding the
   design space of light-weight structural materials with pattern

Abstract = {{Compliant cellular structures with an internal contact mechanism are
   described in this paper. Contact during deformation reduces
   failure-causing bending stresses through stress relief, thereby enabling
   such cellular structures to be stretched more than the corresponding
   structures without contact. Finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out
   to simulate the structure. An analytical model is developed to get
   results quicker than FEA and to develop insight into the mechanics of
   the deformation process. The error in prediction of the maximum
   stretching capacity using the analytical model is less than 7\% when
   compared with finite element simulations. Several materials are
   investigated for such structures. Although the allowable strain of all
   these materials is small, the overall strain of the contact-aided
   cellular structures is at least an order of magnitude greater than that
   of the constitutive material. The contact mechanism and the induced
   stress relief increase the stretching capacity of the contact-aided
   cellular structures by as much as 100\%. Experiments are conducted to
   validate the models, and good agreement is found. A high-strain morphing
   aircraft skin is examined as an application of these mechanisms. The
   results indicate that the proposed skin structure not only increases the
   morphing capacity but also decreases the structural mass by 13\% as
   compared with a cellular skin without contact.}},

   to achieve their intended behaviors. We introduce a custom-developed
   photopolymer chemistry that is suitable for near-infrared (NIR) TPL
   fabrication but remains unreactive in the visible-light regime for
   HOT-based handling. We facilitated the optimal HOT-based actuation of
   TPL-fabricated microsystems by advancing a ray-optics-based
   optical-force simulation tool to work with microbodies of any arbitrary
   shape. We demonstrate the utility of this integrated system via
   fabrication of three unique case studies, which could not be achieved

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{267}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, novel beam-like mechanical metamaterials (BLMMs) with
   different flexural rigidities in two directions are proposed. The BLMMs
   are composed of the rigid parts and the flexible parts, showing totally
   different flexural rigidities in rigid and flexible directions. The
   BLMMs exhibit quite small flexural rigidities in the flexible direction
   and easy to be rolled up, large flexural rigidities in the rigid
   direction and hard to be deformed. The rigid part is composed of the
   hollow or solid structures connected by concave-convex structures
   (CCSs), and the flexible part is composed of a thin rod. Moreover, the
   rod in the flexible part can be made of a material with a larger Young's
   modulus and narrower width to enhance/reduce the flexural rigidity in
   the rigid/flexible direction. Theoretical calculations, finite-element
   simulations and experiments are employed to investigate the properties
   of the proposed BLMMs. It is found that the depth of the vertex of the
   CCSs is the main factor affecting the flexural rigidities in the rigid
   direction. The proposed BLMMs with appropriate geometrical parameters
   have excellent mechanical properties, indicate great potential for
   application in fields of construction, collapsible equipment, and
   flexible structure.}},

Title = {{HIV incidence after pre-exposure prophylaxis initiation among women and
   men at elevated HIV risk: A population-based study in rural Kenya and
   Uganda}},
Journal = {{PLOS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Author summary
   Why was this study done?
   Despite major gains in HIV testing and treatment, there were 1.7 million
   new HIV infections worldwide in 2019, of which nearly 60\% occurred in
   sub-Saharan Africa.
   Daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir disoproxil
   fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) is highly effective for HIV prevention
   and could substantially reduce new HIV infections if offered alongside
   access to HIV testing and treatment.
   Little is known about the incidence of new HIV infections among PrEP
   users in settings with generalized HIV epidemics, particularly when
   offered broadly across communities where access to HIV testing and
   treatment have already been scaled up.
   What did the researchers do and find?
   In 16 communities in rural Kenya and Uganda, we conducted community-wide
   HIV testing and offered universal access to PrEP with an inclusive
   approach to eligibility (for persons in serodifferent partnerships,
   those identified by an HIV risk prediction tool, or those who
   self-identified as being at risk of HIV). We offered rapid PrEP start
   and a flexible care delivery model with follow-up visits at health
   facilities or community-based sites for HIV testing and PrEP refills.
   Of 74,541 persons who tested negative for HIV, 15,632 (21\%) were
   assessed to be at elevated HIV risk, of whom 5,447 (35\%) started PrEP.
   Overall, 79\% of persons who initiated PrEP engaged in the program for
   follow-up visits.
   Among PrEP initiators in the 16 study communities, there were 25
   seroconversions over 7,150 person-years of follow-up. HIV incidence was
   0.35 per 100 person-years (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.22-0.49).
   In 8 communities, we compared HIV incidence among PrEP initiators to
   persons with similar characteristics (matched controls) from the year
   before PrEP was available. Compared to matched controls, HIV incidence
   was 74\% lower among PrEP initiators overall; 76\% lower among women who
   initiated PrEP; and 40\% lower among men who initiated PrEP, although
   this result among men did not reach statistical significance.
   What do these findings mean?
   Providing universal access to PrEP in the context of community-wide HIV
   testing in rural Kenya and Uganda was associated with lower HIV
   incidence among persons who initiated PrEP compared to matched recent
   controls.
   We found lower HIV incidence after PrEP initiation among women, for whom
   rates of new HIV infections are higher than in men, including in recent
   prevention studies without PrEP. These results suggest that PrEP may
   help to close the gap in new infections between men and women.
   Universal access to HIV testing, treatment, and prevention, including
   rapid provision of PrEP with flexible service delivery, could reduce HIV
   incidence in generalized epidemic settings.
   Background
   Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective for HIV
   prevention, but data are limited on HIV incidence among PrEP users in
   generalized epidemic settings, particularly outside of selected risk
   groups. We performed a population-based PrEP study in rural Kenya and
   Uganda and sought to evaluate both changes in HIV incidence and clinical
   and virologic outcomes following seroconversion on PrEP.
   Methods and findings
   During population-level HIV testing of individuals >= 15 years in 16
   communities in the Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health
   (SEARCH) study (NCT01864603), we offered universal access to PrEP with
   enhanced counseling for persons at elevated HIV risk (based on
   serodifferent partnership, machine learning-based risk score, or
   self-identified HIV risk). We offered rapid or same-day PrEP initiation
   and flexible service delivery with follow-up visits at facilities or
   community-based sites at 4, 12, and every 12 weeks up to week 144. Among
   participants with incident HIV infection after PrEP initiation, we
   offered same-day antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and analyzed
   HIV RNA, tenofovir hair concentrations, drug resistance, and viral
   suppression (<1,000 c/ml based on available assays) after ART start.
   Using Poisson regression with cluster-robust standard errors, we
   compared HIV incidence among PrEP initiators to incidence among
   propensity score-matched recent historical controls (from the year
   before PrEP availability) in 8 of the 16 communities, adjusted for risk
   group. Among 74,541 individuals who tested negative for HIV,
   15,632/74,541 (21\%) were assessed to be at elevated HIV risk;
   5,447/15,632 (35\%) initiated PrEP (49\% female; 29\% 15-24 years; 19\%
   in serodifferent partnerships), of whom 79\% engaged in >= 1 follow-up
   visit and 61\% self-reported PrEP adherence at >= 1 visit. Over 7,150
   person-years of follow-up, HIV incidence was 0.35 per 100 person-years
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.22-0.49) among PrEP initiators. Among
   matched controls, HIV incidence was 0.92 per 100 person-years (95\% CI
   0.49-1.41), corresponding to 74\% lower incidence among PrEP initiators
   compared to matched controls (adjusted incidence rate ratio {[}aIRR]
   0.26, 95\% CI 0.09-0.75; p = 0.013). Among women, HIV incidence was 76\%
   lower among PrEP initiators versus matched controls (aIRR 0.24, 95\% CI
   0.07-0.79; p = 0.019); among men, HIV incidence was 40\% lower, but not
   significantly so (aIRR 0.60, 95\% CI 0.12-3.05; p = 0.54). Of 25
   participants with incident HIV infection (68\% women), 7/25 (28\%)
   reported taking PrEP <= 30 days before HIV diagnosis, and 24/25 (96\%)
   started ART. Of those with repeat HIV RNA after ART start, 18/19 (95\%)
   had <1,000 c/ml. One participant with viral non-suppression was found to
   have transmitted viral resistance, as well as emtricitabine resistance
   possibly related to PrEP use. Limitations include the lack of
   contemporaneous controls to assess HIV incidence without PrEP and that
   plasma samples were not archived to assess for baseline acute infection.
   Conclusions
   Population-level offer of PrEP with rapid start and flexible service
   delivery was associated with 74\% lower HIV incidence among PrEP
   initiators compared to matched recent controls prior to PrEP
   availability. HIV infections were significantly lower among women who
   started PrEP. Universal HIV testing with linkage to treatment and
   prevention, including PrEP, is a promising approach to accelerate
   reductions in new infections in generalized epidemic settings.}},

Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Disordered solids often change their elastic response as they slowly
   age. Using experiments and simulations, we study how aging disordered
   planar networks under an applied stress affects their nonlinear elastic
   response. We are able to modify dramatically the elastic properties of
   our systems in the nonlinear regime. Using simulations, we study two
   models for the microscopic evolution of properties of such a material;
   the first considers changes in the material strength, while the second

   clinics: A feasibility programmatic evaluation in Kenya}},

Abstract = {{Author summaryWhy was this study done? Adolescent girls and young women
   (AGYW) in Africa are disproportionately affected by HIV infections
   because of cultural, structural, biological, and behavior factors.
   Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), as a highly potent and recommended
   discreet user-controlled HIV prevention strategy, has the potential to
   substantially reduce new HIV infections in African women if delivered
   with high coverage and if used with sufficient adherence. However, data
   are limited on ``real-world{''} implementation approaches to efficiently
   reach at-risk women who may benefit from PrEP. Family planning (FP)
   clinics provide care to young women at risk for acquiring HIV and have
   in-built staffing, supply chain, and HIV testing access, which could
   contribute to more efficient PrEP implementation with less cost, but no
   study has evaluated this model in ``real-world{''} settings. What did
   the researchers do and find? We conducted a pilot open-label,
   ``real-world{''} implementation program to evaluate the feasibility of
   integrating PrEP delivery into routine FP clinics to reach HIV at-risk
   young women. General-population women accessing FP services were
   universally screened for HIV behavior risk factors and were counseled
   for PrEP by program-dedicated nurses embedded in 8 public health FP
   clinics in a high-HIV-prevalence region in Kenya. We found that FP
   clinics can be an effective platform to efficiently reach HIV at-risk
   women who may benefit from PrEP. PrEP screening was feasible, and 22\%
   of the general population of women took PrEP home. There was a high
   drop-off in early PrEP continuation (41\% PrEP continuation at 1 month)
   particularly among AGYW <24 years old, but a subset of women persisted
   on PrEP (25\% at month 3 and 15\% at month 6), with higher continuation
   among women with HIV-positive partners, possibly indicating further
   reflection or decision-making on PrEP use. Women's perceived risk for
   HIV, including having an HIV-positive partner, was an important driver
   of initiation and continuation on PrEP. What do these findings mean? To
   our knowledge, this project provides the first demonstration of
   ``real-world{''} delivery of PrEP for at-risk AGYW integrated into FP
   clinics in Africa, a priority population for HIV prevention. These
   findings demonstrate that it may be feasible to integrate PrEP delivery
   in public health FP clinics, making this a platform potential
   ``one-stop{''} location for FP and PrEP. With expanding PrEP awareness,
   uptake and continuation are likely to increase among women at risk.
   Evidence from this work will inform next steps for wider delivery of
   PrEP and next-generation PrEP formulations (e.g., multipurpose HIV
   prevention and contraception technologies) in FP clinics, not only in
   Kenya but in other resource-limited settings globally.
   Background Young women account for a disproportionate fraction of new
   HIV infections in Africa and are a priority population for HIV
   prevention, including implementation of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP).
   The overarching goal of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility
   of integrating PrEP delivery within routine family planning (FP) clinics
   to serve as a platform to efficiently reach at-risk adolescent girls and
   young women (AGYW) for PrEP in HIV high-burden settings. Methods and
   findings The PrEP Implementation in Young Women and Adolescents (PrIYA)
   program is a real-world implementation program to demonstrate
   integration of PrEP delivery for at-risk AGYW in FP clinics in Kisumu,
   Kenya. Between November 2017 and June 2018, women aged 15 to 45 from the
   general population seeking FP services at 8 public health clinics were
   universally screened for HIV behavioral risk factors and offered PrEP
   following national PrEP guidelines. We evaluated PrEP uptake and
   continuation, and robust Poisson regression methods were used to
   identify correlates of uptake and early continuation of PrEP, with age
   included as a one-knot linear spline. Overall, 1,271 HIV-uninfected
   women accessing routine FP clinics were screened for PrEP; the median
   age was 25 years (interquartile range {[}IQR]: 22-29), 627 (49\%) were
   <24 years old, 1,026 (82\%) were married, more than one-third (34\%) had
   partners of unknown HIV status, and the vast majority (n = 1,200
   {[}94\%]) reported recent condom-less sex. Of 1,271 women screened, 278
   (22\%) initiated PrEP, and 114 (41\%) returned for at least one refill
   visit after initiation. PrEP uptake was independently associated with
   reported male-partner HIV status (HIV-positive 94\%, unknown 35\%,
   HIV-negative 8\%; p < 0.001) and marital status (28\% unmarried versus
   married 21\%; p = 0.04), and a higher proportion of women >= 24 years
   (26\%; 191/740) initiated PrEP compared to 16\% (87/531) of young women
   <24 years (p < 0.001). There was a moderate and statistically
   non-significant unadjusted increase in PrEP uptake among women using
   oral contraception pills (OCPs) compared to women using injectable or
   long-acting reversible contraception methods (OCP 28\% versus
   injectable/implants/intrauterine devices {[}IUDs] 18\%; p = 0.06). Among
   women with at least one post-PrEP initiation follow-up visit (n = 278),
   no HIV infection was documented during the project period. Overall,
   continuation of PrEP use at 1, 3, and 6 months post initiation was 41\%,
   24\%, and 15\%, respectively. The likelihood for early continuation of
   PrEP use (i.e., return for at least one PrEP refill within 45 days post
   initiation) was strongly associated with reported male-partner HIV
   status (HIV-positive 67\%, -negative 39\%, unknown 31\%; overall effect
   p = 0.001), and a higher proportion of women >= 24 years old continued
   PrEP at 1 month compared with young women <24 years old (47\% versus
   29\%; p = 0.002). For women >= 24 years old, the likelihood to continue
   PrEP use at 1 month post initiation increased by 3\% for each additional
   year of a woman's age (adjusted prevalence ratio {[}PR]: 1.03; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 1.01-1.05; p = 0.01). In contrast, for women
   <24 years old, the likelihood of continuing PrEP for each additional
   year of a woman's age was high in magnitude (approximately 6\%) but
   statistically non-significant (adjusted PR: 1.06; 95\% CI: 0.97-1.16; p
   = 0.18). Frequently reported reasons for discontinuing PrEP were low
   perceived risk of HIV (25\%), knowledge that partner was HIV negative
   (24\%), experiencing side effects (20\%), and pill burden (17\%).
   Study limitations include lack of qualitative work to provide insights
   into women's decision-making on PrEP uptake and continuation, the small
   number of measured covariates imposed by the program data, and a
   nonrandomized design limiting definitive ascertainment of the robustness
   of a PrEP-dedicated nurse-led implementation strategy. Conclusions In
   this real-world PrEP implementation program in Kenya, integration of
   universal screening and counseling for PrEP in FP clinics was feasible,
   making this platform a potential ``one-stop{''} location for FP and
   PrEP. There was a high drop-off in PrEP continuation, but a subset of
   women continued PrEP use at least through 1 month, possibly indicating
   further reflection or decision-making on PrEP use. Greater efforts to
   support PrEP normalization and persistence for African women are needed
   to help women navigate their decisions about HIV prevention preferences
   as their reproductive goals and HIV vulnerability evolve.}},

   also negative thermal expansion (NTE). In particular an analytical model
   to quantify the radial strain with changes in temperature is derived and

Abstract = {{Background: The adherence of the heart to physical laws, such as
   Laplace's Law, may act as a measure of the organ's relative efficiency.
   Allometric relationships were investigated to assess the heart's
   efficiency concerning end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, cardiac
   pressurization energy, cardiac output and mass.
   Methods: Data to generate allometric relationships was obtained using a
   literature search, identifying heart and lung data across different
   mammalian and bird species. Statistical analysis was carried out using
   ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation.
   Results: Near isometric relationships exist between body mass and seven
   parameters indicating no ``efficiency of size{''} with scaling of the
   heart, and size-matching of the heart to the lungs and whole body. Even
   though there was equal efficiency in pressurization energy generation,
   cardiac output was maximally efficient in small mammals < 10 kg and
   birds; the human heart reached only 71\% efficiency. This loss in
   cardiac efficiency with increasing body mass can be explained by the
   aortic cross-section that scales following the three-quarter allometry
   law, compared to end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes that scale
   isometrically. The heart is therefore throttled by a relatively small
   aorta at large body size.
   Conclusions: Mammalian and avian hearts operate at similar efficiencies,
   demonstrating a high degree of symmorphosis, however cardiac output
   efficiency decreases in larger animals due to a relatively negative
   aortic cross-section allometry. This work has a myriad of potential
   applications including explaining cardiac dysfunction in athletes,
   patient-prosthesis mismatch in aortic valve replacement and why heavy
   exercise is associated with a worse prognosis than mild or moderate
   exercise.}},

Abstract = {{Polymers represent a unique class of materials which are capable of
   forming architectural arrangements at molecular, nano- and higher levels
   of organization. While numerous properties made polymers highly
   attractive materials in many applications, their stimuli-responsive
   characteristics have been recognized only recently. This chapter
   provides an overview of a variety of responses of polymers and polymeric
   films that exhibit pro-active behaviors in response to internal or
   external stimuli. These ``smart{''} macromolecules offer a number of
   unique attributes with potential emerging applications in medicine,
   pharmacology, nanotechnology, biomaterials, or other fields of materials
   science and materials engineering. The stimuli-responsive
   characteristics described herein focus on physical and chemical stimuli
   that result in numerous responses leading to unique behaviors in complex

Abstract = {{In this paper, the variability of elastic characteristics (Young's
   modulus and Poisson's ratio) of hexagonal crystals has been studied.
   Analytic expressions for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are
   obtained. Stationary values for these elastic characteristics are found.
   Young's modulus has three stationary values, and Poisson's ratio has
   eight stationary values. Numerical analysis of these elastic
   characteristics for hexagonal crystals is given based on the
   experimental data from the Landolt-Bornstein handbook. Global extrema of
   Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for hexagonal crystals are found.
   Crystals are found in which the maximum values exceeds the upper limit
   for isotropic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Rectangular chiral lattices possess a two-fold symmetry; in order to
   characterize the overall behavior of such lattices, a two-dimensional
   orthotropic chiral micropolar theory is proposed. Eight additional

   Homogenization procedures are also developed for the chiral lattice with

   micropolar theory are derived analytically for the case of the rigid
   circles and numerically for the case of the deformable circles. The

Abstract = {{In continuum mechanics, the non-centrosymmetric micropolar theory is
   usually used to capture the chirality inherent in materials. However,
   when reduced to a two dimensional (2D) isotropic problem, the resulting
   model becomes non-chiral. Therefore, influence of the chiral effect
   cannot be properly characterized by existing theories for 2D chiral
   solids. To circumvent this difficulty, based on reinterpretation of
   isotropic tensors in the 2D case, we propose a continuum theory to model
   the chiral effect for 2D isotropic chiral solids. A single material
   parameter related to chirality is introduced to characterize the
   coupling between the bulk deformation and the internal rotation, which
   is a fundamental feature of 2D chiral solids. Coherently, the proposed
   continuum theory is applied for the homogenization of a triangular
   chiral lattice, from which the effective material constants of the
   lattice are analytically determined. The unique behavior in the chiral
   lattice is demonstrated through the analyses of a static tension problem
   and a plane wave propagation problem. The results, which cannot be
   predicted by the non-chiral model, are verified by the exact solution of
   the discrete model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new generalized cross-property relation is proposed for predicting the
   relative elastic moduli (Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus)
   from the relative conductivities (thermal or electrical) of isotropic
   porous materials with spheroidal pores. Using this
   cross-property-relation it is possible to estimate the elastic moduli
   when the conductivites are known (either from real-world measurements or
   from numerical calculations on digital microstructures) and vice versa.
   This generalized cross-property relation contains the case of spherical
   or isometric pores as a special case, but is sufficiently general to
   account for the properties of materials with strongly anisometric pores,
   i.e. randomly orientated prolate and oblate pores, including the extreme
   cases of pore channels or microcracks. The exponent of this
   cross-property relation is shown in graphical form and for future
   reference with respect to practical applications its numerical values
   are listed in tabular form as a function of the pore aspect ratio and

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose four kinds of two-dimensional square beam-like
   zigzag lattice structures and study their bandgaps and directional
   propagation of elastic waves. The band structures are calculated by
   using the finite element method. Both the in-plane and out-of-plane
   waves are investigated simultaneously via the three-dimensional Euler
   beam elements. The mechanism of the bandgap generation is analyzed by
   studying the vibration modes at the bandgap edges. The effects of the
   geometry parameters of the xy-and z-zigzag lattices on the bandgaps are
   investigated and discussed. Multiple complete bandgaps are found owing
   to the separation of the degeneracy by introducing bending arms. The
   bandgaps are sensitive to the geometry parameters of the periodic
   systems. The deformed displacement fields of the harmonic responses of a
   finite lattice structure subjected to harmonic loads at different
   positions are illustrated to show the directional wave propagation. An
   extension of the proposed concept to the hexagonal lattices is also
   presented. The research work in this paper is relevant to the practical
   design of cellular structures with enhanced vibro-acoustics performance.

Abstract = {{In the present paper a new additive manufacturing processing route is
   introduced for ultra-high performance concrete. Interdisciplinary work
   involving materials science, computation, robotics, architecture and
   design resulted in the development of an innovative way of 3D printing
   cementitious materials. The 3D printing process involved is based on a
   FDM-like technique, in the sense that a material is deposited layer by
   layer through an extrusion printhead mounted on a 6-axis robotic arm.
   The mechanical properties of 3D printed materials are assessed. The
   proposed technology succeeds in solving many of the problems that can be
   found in the literature. Most notably, this process allows the
   production of 3D large-scale complex geometries, without the use of
   temporary supports, as opposed to 2.5D examples found in the literature
   for concrete 3D printing. Architectural cases of application are used as
   examples in order to demonstrate the potentialities of the technology.
   Two structural elements were produced and constitute some of the largest
   3D printed concrete parts available until now. Multifunctionality was
   enabled for both structural elements by taking advantage of the complex
   geometry which can be achieved using our technology for large-scale
   additive manufacturing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Kirigami, the creative art of paper cutting, is a promising paradigm for
   mechanical metamaterials. However, to make kirigami-inspired structures
   a reality requires controlling the topology of kirigami to achieve
   connectivity and rigidity. We address this question by deriving the
   maximum number of cuts (minimum number of links) that still allow us to
   preserve global rigidity and connectivity of the kirigami. A
   deterministic hierarchical construction method yields an efficient
   topological way to control both the number of connected pieces and the
   total degrees of freedom. A statistical approach to the control of
   rigidity and connectivity in kirigami with random cuts complements the
   deterministic pathway, and shows that both the number of connected
   pieces and the degrees of freedom show percolation transitions as a
   function of the density of cuts (links). Together, this provides a
   general framework for the control of rigidity and connectivity in planar
   kirigami.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose various types of two-dimensional (2D) square
   zigzag lattice structures, and we study their bandgaps and directional
   propagation of elastic waves. The band structures and the transmission
   spectra of the systems are calculated by using the finite element
   method. The effects of the geometry parameters of the 2D-zigzag lattices
   on the bandgaps are investigated and discussed. The mechanism of the
   bandgap generation is analyzed by studying the vibration modes at the
   bandgap edges. Multiple wide complete bandgaps are found in a wide
   porosity range owing to the separation of the degeneracy by introducing
   bending arms. The bandgaps are sensitive to the geometry parameters of
   the systems. The deformed displacement fields of the transient response
   of finite structures subjected to time-harmonic loads are presented to
   show the directional wave propagation. The research in this paper is
   relevant to the practical design of cellular structures with enhanced
   vibro-acoustics performance.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a systematic approach for engineering the dispersive

   problem as an optimization problem, driven by the desired band gap, and
   constrained only by the cell's dispersive characteristics; the latter
   are expressed in terms of the Floquet-Bloch eigenvalue problem.
   Numerical results in the time-domain, using metamaterial assemblies with
   only narrow periodicity, demonstrate that the engineered metamaterial
   attains the desired behavior. Extensions to wave steering, shielding,

Title = {{Compliant morphing structures from twisted bulk metallic glass ribbons}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{145}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate the use of pre-twisted metallic ribbons as
   building blocks for shape-changing structures. We manufacture these
   elements by twisting initially flat ribbons about their (lengthwise)
   centroidal axis into a helicoidal geometry, then thermoforming them to
   make this configuration a stress-free reference state. The helicoidal
   shape allows the ribbons to have preferred bending directions that vary
   throughout their length. These bending directions serve as compliant
   joints and enable several deployed and stowed configurations that are
   unachievable without pre-twist, provided that compaction does not induce
   material failure. We fabricate these ribbons using a bulk metallic glass
   (BMG), for its exceptional elasticity and thermoforming attributes.
   Combining numerical simulations, an analytical model based on a
   geometrically nonlinear plate theory and torsional experiments, we
   analyze the finite-twisting mechanics of various ribbon geometries. We
   find that, in ribbons with undulated edges, the twisting deformations
   can be better localized onto desired regions prior to thermoforming.
   Finally, we join multiple ribbons to create deployable systems with
   complex morphing attributes enabled by the intrinsic chirality of our
   twisted structural elements. Our work proposes a framework for creating
   fully metallic, yet compliant structures that may find application as
   elements for space structures and compliant robots. (c) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{Isogeometric Analysis and Shape Optimization of Holed Structures via the
   Patch Removing Technique}},
Journal = {{CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING \& SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{787-806}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a patch removing based Isogeometric analysis (PR-IGA)
   method is proposed to conduct the holed structural analysis with only
   one parametric domain, in which there are also no trimmed elements. The
   theoretical foundation of this novel patch removing approach is that any
   holed structure can be obtained by removing sub-patches (i.e., the
   holes) from an intact base patch. Since the parametric domains of these
   patches are all meshed by rectangular grids, the elements in the
   resulted holed structural parametric domain could all be untrimmed
   rectangles under certain mapping conditions. To achieve the special
   condition, a systematic technique consisting of T-spline local
   refinement and control points substitution/adjustment is provided. Due
   to the intactness of parametric elements, the analysis procedure of
   holed structures based on the proposed PRIGA is quite simplified and
   efficient compared to traditional multi-patch and trimming schemes.
   Moreover, after the deduction of analytical sensitivities related to
   structural mass and mechanical responses, the PR-IGA is directly
   employed in the holed structural shape optimization to successfully
   eliminate the need for model transformation during modeling, analysis
   and optimization processes. Numerical examples involving analysis and
   shape optimization of complex holed structures are presented to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Title = {{Changes in HIV Incidence among People Who Inject Drugs in Taiwan
   following Introduction of a Harm Reduction Program: A Study of Two
   Cohorts}},
Journal = {{PLOS MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Editors' Summary
   Background
   About 35 million people worldwide are currently infected with HIV, the
   virus that causes AIDS, and about 2.3 million people become newly
   infected every year. HIV is mainly transmitted through unprotected sex
   with an infected partner. However, people who inject drugs (PWID) have a
   particularly high risk of HIV infection because blood transfer through
   needle and syringe sharing can transmit the virus. It is estimated that
   5\%-10\% of all people living with HIV are PWID. Indeed, in some regions
   of the world the primary route of HIV transmission is through shared
   drug injection equipment and the prevalence (the proportion of a
   population that has a specific disease) of HIV infection among PWID is
   very high. In Asia, for example, more than a quarter of PWID are HIV
   positive. Because the high prevalence of HIV among PWID poses a global
   health challenge, bodies such as the Joint United Nations Programme on
   HIV/AIDS endorse harm reduction strategies to prevent risky injection
   behaviors among PWID. These strategies include the provision of clean
   needles and syringes, opioid substitution therapy such as methadone
   maintenance treatment, and antiretroviral treatment for HIV-positive
   PWID.
   Why Was This Study Done? ?
   Although harm reduction strategies for combating HIV epidemics among
   PWID have been implemented in several countries, few large-scale studies
   have examined the association between HIV incidence (the proportion of
   new cases of HIV in a population per year) and exposure to harm
   reduction programs among PWID. In this cohort study (an investigation
   that determines the characteristics of a group of people and then
   follows them over time), the researchers determine the association
   between harm reduction programs and HIV incidence among PWID in Taiwan.
   HIV infections used to be rare among the 60,000 PWID living in Taiwan,
   but after the introduction of a new HIV strain into the country in 2003,
   an HIV epidemic spread rapidly. In response, the Taiwanese government
   introduced a pilot program of harm reduction that included the provision
   of clean needles and syringes and health education in July 2005. The
   program was expanded to include methadone maintenance treatment in early
   2006 and implemented nationwide in June 2006.
   What Did the Researchers Do and Find? ?
   The researchers enrolled two study populations. The first cohort
   comprised 3,851 PWID who were incarcerated for illicit drug use between
   2004 and 2010 and who tested positive for HIV upon admission into
   prison. By using the BED assay, which indicates whether an HIV infection
   is recent, the researchers were able to determine the HIV incidence
   among the prisoners. In 2004, the estimated HIV incidence among
   prisoners with a history of drug injection was 6.44\%. The incidence
   peaked in 2005 at 18.2\%, but fell to 0.3\% in 2010.
   The second study population comprised 2,473 individuals who were HIV
   negative on January 1, 2006, and who had been incarcerated for drug use
   crimes but were released on July 16, 2007, during an amnesty. The
   researchers regularly interviewed these participants between their
   release and 2010 about their use of harm reduction interventions, and
   obtained other data about them (for example, diagnosis of HIV infection)
   from official databases. Analysis of all these data indicated that, in
   this cohort, attendance at methadone maintenance treatment clinics and
   frequent use of needle and syringe services were both associated with a
   significantly lower HIV incidence.
   What Do These Findings Mean? ?
   These findings suggest that the introduction of a comprehensive harm
   reduction program in Taiwan was associated with a significant reduction
   in the HIV incidence rate among PWID. These findings must be interpreted
   with caution, however. First, because the participants in the study were
   selected from PWID with histories of incarceration, the findings may not
   be representative of all PWID in Taiwan or of PWID in other countries.
   Second, PWID who chose to use needle and syringe services or methadone
   maintenance treatment clinics might have shared other unknown
   characteristics that affected their risk of HIV infection. Finally, some
   of the reduction in HIV incidence seen during the study is likely to be
   associated with the availability of free treatment, which has been
   offered to all HIV-positive individuals in Taiwan since 1997. Despite
   these limitations, these findings suggest that countries with a high
   prevalence and incidence of HIV among PWID should provide comprehensive
   harm reduction services to their populations to reduce risky drug
   injection behaviors.

   Background
   Harm reduction strategies for combating HIV epidemics among people who
   inject drugs (PWID) have been implemented in several countries. However,
   large-scale studies using sensitive measurements of HIV incidence and
   intervention exposures in defined cohorts are rare. The aim of this
   study was to determine the association between harm reduction programs
   and HIV incidence among PWID.
   Methods and Findings
   The study included two populations. For 3,851 PWID who entered prison
   between 2004 and 2010 and tested HIV positive upon incarceration, we
   tested their sera using a BED HIV-1 capture enzyme immunoassay to
   estimate HIV incidence. Also, we enrolled in a prospective study a
   cohort of 4,357 individuals who were released from prison via an amnesty
   on July 16, 2007. We followed them with interviews at intervals of 6-12
   mo and by linking several databases. A total of 2,473 participants who
   were HIV negative in January 2006 had interviews between then and 2010
   to evaluate the association between use of harm reduction programs and
   HIV incidence. We used survival methods with attendance at methadone
   clinics as a time-varying covariate to measure the association with HIV
   incidence. We used a Poisson regression model and calculated the HIV
   incidence rate to evaluate the association between needle/syringe
   program use and HIV incidence. Among the population of PWID who were
   imprisoned, the implementation of comprehensive harm reduction programs
   and a lower mean community HIV viral load were associated with a reduced
   HIV incidence among PWID. The HIV incidence in this population of PWID
   decreased from 18.2\% in 2005 to 0.3\% in 2010. In an individual-level
   analysis of the amnesty cohort, attendance at methadone clinics was
   associated with a significantly lower HIV incidence (adjusted hazard
   ratio: 0.20, 95\% CI: 0.06-0.67), and frequent users of needle/syringe
   program services had lower HIV incidence (0\% in high NSP users, 0.5\%
   in non NSP users). In addition, no HIV seroconversions were detected
   among prison inmates.
   Conclusions
   Although our data are affected by participation bias, they strongly
   suggest that comprehensive harm- reduction services and free treatment
   were associated with reversal of a rapidly emerging epidemic of HIV
   among PWID.

Abstract = {{A bimorph composed of ferrimagnetic cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4, CFO) and
   flexible muscovite was fabricated via van der Waals epitaxy. The
   combination of X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy
   was conducted to reveal the heteroepitaxy of the CFO/muscovite system.
   The robust magnetic behaviors against mechanical bending were
   characterized by hysteresis measurements and magnetic force microscopy,
   which maintain a saturation magnetization (M-s) of similar to 120-150
   emu/cm(3) under different bending states. The large magnetostrictive
   response of the CFO film was then determined by digital holographic
   microscopy, where the difference of magnetostrction coefficient (Delta
   lambda) is -104 ppm. The superior performance of this bimorph is
   attributed to the nature of weak interaction between film and substrate.
   Such a flexible CFO/muscovite bimorph provides a new platform to develop
   next-generation flexible magnetic devices.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose the concept that a device based on mechanical
   metamaterials can be used to induce and control its own rotational
   motion as a result of internal deformations due to the conversion of
   translational degrees of freedom into rotational ones. The application
   of a linear force on the structural units of the system may be
   fine-tuned in order to obtain a desired type of rotation. In particular,
   we show, how it is possible to maximise the extent of rotation of the
   system through the alteration of the geometry of the system. We also
   show how a device based on this concept can be connected to an external
   body in order to rotate it which result may potentially prove to be very
   important in the case of applications such as telescopes employed in
   space. (C) 2017 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{The compressibility properties of systems consisting of generic rotating
   rigid triangles are analyzed and discussed. It is shown that these
   systems which are usually associated with auxeticity can exhibit
   strongly anisotropic properties for certain conformations, which may
   give rise to the anomalous property of negative linear compressibility
   (NLC), that is, the system with particular geometry will expand along
   one direction when loaded hydrostatically. It is also shown that through
   carefully choosing the geometric features (i.e. the dimensions and the
   alignment of the rotating triangles as well as the angles between them)
   and the direction along which the linear compressibility is measured,
   one may control the magnitude and range of the NLC. All this provides a
   novel but effective method of manufacturing the systems which can be
   tailored to achieve particular values of NLC to fit particular practical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The design space of mechanical metamaterials can be drastically enriched
   by the employment of non-mechanical interactions between unit cells.
   Here, the mechanical behavior of planar metamaterials consisting of
   rotating squares is controlled through the periodic embedment of
   modified elementary cells with attractive and repulsive configurations
   of the magnets. The proposed design of mechanical metamaterials produced
   by three-dimensional printing enables the efficient and quick
   reprogramming of their mechanical properties through the insertion of
   the magnets into various locations within the metamaterial. Experimental
   and numerical studies reveal that under equibiaxial compression various
   mechanical characteristics, such as buckling strain and post-buckling
   stiffness, can be finely tuned through the rational placement of the
   magnets. Moreover, this strategy is shown to be efficient in introducing
   bistability into the metamaterial with an initially single equilibrium
   state.}},

Title = {{Control of Uniaxial Negative Thermal Expansion in Layered Perovskites by
   Tuning Layer Thickness}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Uniaxial negative thermal expansion (NTE) is known to occur in low n
   members of the A(n+1)B(n)O(3n+1) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) layered
   perovskite series with a frozen rotation of BO6 octahedra about the
   layering axis. Previous work has shown that this NTE arises due to the
   combined effects of a close proximity to a transition to a competing
   phase, so called ``symmetry trapping{''}, and highly anisotropic elastic
   compliance specific to the symmetry of the NTE phase. We extend this
   analysis to the broader RP family (n = 1, 2, 3, 4,...,infinity),
   demonstrating that by changing the fraction of layer interface in the
   structure (i.e., the value of 1/n) one may control the anisotropic
   compliance that is necessary for the pronounced uniaxial NTE observed in
   these systems. More detailed analysis of how the components of the
   compliance matrix develop with 1/n allows us to identify different
   regimes, linking enhancements in compliance between these regimes to the
   crystallographic degrees of freedom in the structure. We further discuss
   how the perovskite layer thickness affects the frequencies of soft zone
   boundary modes with large negative Gruneisen parameters, associated with
   the aforementioned phase transition, that constitute the thermodynamic
   driving force for NTE. This new insight complements our previous
   work-showing that chemical control may be used to switch from positive
   to negative thermal expansion in these systems-since it makes the layer
   thickness, n, an additional design parameter that may be used to
   engineer layered perovskites with tuneable thermal expansion. In these
   respects, we predict that, with appropriate chemical substitution, the n
   = 1 phase will be the systemin which the most pronounced NTE could be
   achieved.}},

Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a general method for creating a new type of
   hierarchical structures at any level in both 2D and 3D. A simple rule
   based on a rotate-and-mirror procedure is introduced to achieve
   multilevel hierarchies. These new hierarchical structures have
   remarkably few degrees of freedom compared to existing designs by other
   methods. More importantly, these structures exhibit synchronized motions
   during opening or closure, resulting in uniform and easily-controllable
   deformations. Furthermore, a simple analytical formula is found which
   can be used to avoid collision of units of the structure during the
   closing process. The novel design concept is verified by mathematical
   analyses, computational simulations and physical experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminium honeycomb is a lightweight load carrying structure widely used
   in aerospace and automotive industries. In this study, In-plane
   compression analysis of AA 8011 reinforced honeycomb was performed
   numerically and experimentally. Geometrical parameters like cell size,
   cell wall thickness and node length were varied for attaining different
   models. Cell size was varied as 7 mm and 10 mm while node length as 25
   mm, 30 mm and 35 mm respectively. Cell wall thickness of reinforced
   honeycomb was kept as 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mm respectively. Finite element
   simulations were performed on various combination of reinforced
   honeycomb configuration using IS DYNA. Numerical model was validated
   with experimental results performed on reinforced core. Cell-wall
   thickness has major influence on energy absorption and peak crushing
   force of honeycomb. Enhancement in cell wall thickness increased
   crushing strength and energy absorption capacity of the structure
   whereas reverse effect was observed with increase in cell size. Node
   length has less impact on performance characteristics of honeycomb core.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{174}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents a new approach for failure modeling of a cellular
   structure manufactured with a 3D printing technology. For this purpose,
   the honeycomb topology was designed and fabricated using fused
   deposition modeling of ABSplus material. The proposed method was based
   on the tiebreak contact for connecting plastic joints with cell walls.
   Additionally, two methods based on constitutive models were also
   analyzed. In the first case, an elasto-plastic material model was
   adopted, whereas in the second case an elasto-visco-plastic material
   model with damage was included. Firstly, the mechanical properties of
   ABSplus material were determined and numerically correlated with
   experimental outcomes. Subsequently, a contact parametric study was
   performed, and the optimal contact parameters were evaluated. The
   quasi-static experimental compression tests were simulated using LS-Dyna
   software. The results of actual tests and numerical analyses with three
   different methods for honeycomb structure modeling were compared in
   terms of deformation, force history, failure behavior and energy
   absorption capabilities. It was shown that the contact-based method
   resulted an in an increase of the results quality with better
   reproduction of force characteristic and progressive failure behavior
   during the deformation process, compared to other two methods. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{The geometry of a composite frusta-conical structure with 20 degrees
   apex angle was optimized using topology optimization method. The ATOM
   topology solver was used to perform optimization process. The structure
   was subjected to an axial compressive quasi-static loading where the
   criterion of optimization is the largest absorption of energy per unit
   volume. The optimization resulted in concave shell geometry with a
   volume reduction of 15\%. To compare the effect of geometry on energy
   absorption capability, two types of GFRP specimen with different
   thickness were fabricated using filament winding and hand lay-up
   methods. The axial crushing test results were validated with numerical
   analysis using the commercial finite element software ABAQUS. The
   collapse mode and failure mechanism were investigated and identified.
   The presented methodology helps to find the better geometry instead of
   testing different geometries.}},

Abstract = {{The star-shaped reentrant honeycomb produces lateral shrinkage but also
   rotation under compression. With the consideration of such interesting
   deformation characteristics, the dynamic deformation evolution of the
   sandwich beam with star-shaped reentrant honeycomb core (SSRHC) was
   carried out for the first time. In this experiment, the aluminum foam
   projectile was used to produce local impulsive loading on the sandwich
   beam to research failure/deformation modes and deformation evolution of
   the SSRHC. The experimental results demonstrated the simultaneous
   shrinking and rotating deformations in the core. Finite element model
   (FEM) was employed to capture the dynamic mechanical response of panels
   and SSRHC on account of experimental results. Numerical results
   illustrated that the face panel moved toward the loading area in the
   early stage of impact, and local shrinkage or expansion was found within
   different regions of the star honeycomb cores during the entire
   compression process. In addition, it was found that the rotational
   deformation of the star honeycomb cells mainly occurred in the local
   indentation stage of the sandwich beam.}},

Title = {{Evolution of twinning during cyclic loading of magnesium alloy examined

   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{820}},

Abstract = {{Most complex engineering components experience varied loading in use. We
   conducted successive experiments of cyclic tensile deformation followed
   by electron-backscattered diffraction imaging of the same area on each
   of several magnesium alloy (ZM) sample to investigate the microstructure
   and texture evolution during cyclic loading. In this way we correlated
   the evolving deformed microstructure of cyclically loaded magnesium to
   the initial grain orientations. To investigate the effects of the strain
   path, the behaviour of samples with and without pre-compression was
   compared. Twins can propagate from grain to grain and twin chains will
   form in the material without any pre-deformation. Twin chains are a
   result of twin transmission at grain boundaries and twin transmission
   frequency decreases with increasing grain boundary angles. In the
   absence of pre-compression, the extension twin fraction rises from 0.003
   to 0.019 after two cycles of tensile loading to a strain of 0.03, after
   which it changes only slightly as strain is increased. Twin chains in
   the pre-compressed specimen are activated without any obvious dependence
   on the matrix orientation. The fraction of extension twinning is 0.2 for
   the precompressed specimen. After a cycle of tensile loading to a total
   plastic strain of 0.015, 90\% of the extension twins undergo detwinning.
   The detwinning starts just after reverse loading. Secondary twins
   forming within primary twin interfaces start to nucleate in the
   microstructure of the pre-compressed material at an early stage (at
   plastic strain values of 0.056). This is different from the nucleation
   of secondary twins in the material without pre-compression that occurs
   at a strain of 0.104. The early formation of secondary twinning is due
   to the presence of residual primary twins in the microstructure of the
   pre-compressed material as a result of detwinning of the initial twins.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the interplay between prestress and mechanical properties
   in random elastic networks. To do this in a controlled fashion, we
   introduce an algorithm for creating random free-standing frames that
   support exactly one state of self-stress. By multiplying all the bond
   tensions in this state of self-stress by the same number-which with the
   appropriate normalization corresponds to the physical prestress inside
   the frame-we systematically evaluate the linear mechanical response of
   the frame as a function of prestress. After proving that the mechanical
   moduli of affinely deforming frames are rigorously independent of
   prestress, we turn to nonaffinely deforming frames. In such frames,
   prestress has a profound effect on linear response: not only can it
   change the values of the linear modulus-an effect we demonstrate to be
   related to a suppressive effect of prestress on nonaffinity-but
   prestresses also generically trigger a bistable mechanical response.
   Thus, prestress can be leveraged to both augment the mechanical response
   of network architectures on the fly, and to actuate finite deformations.
   These control modalities may be of use in the design of both novel
   responsive materials and soft actuators.}},

   of tailoring the core geometrical parameters of these iso-volume

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{175}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{In the current work we investigate the extension of the elastic and
   plastic design space of metamaterials by means of multiscale,
   load-specific inner material architectures. In particular, we analyse
   the use of a second scale of material architecturing at the level of the
   elements of the primal lattice structure. To that scope, we consider a
   wide range of inner element designs, from mere hollow shapes to
   double-curved architectures that allow for reduced relative density
   values. Thereupon, we evaluate both analytically and numerically the
   effective elastic and plastic behaviour of square, two-scale
   metamaterial lattice structures, as a function of their second level of
   inner material architecturing. We observe that hollow inner element
   designs allow for a substantially enhanced shear response performance
   both in the elastic and plastic analysis range, retaining invariant
   their specific axial loading behaviour. The performance improvement
   depends on the inner element design parameters and can be up to eighty
   per cent with respect to the reference, single-scale lattice design
   within the elastic analysis range. Accordingly, the results suggest that
   double-curved inner element architectures allow for a shear response
   improvement that can outperform the one of hollow element designs at the
   cost of a reduced axial loading performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the cyclic response of the wrought magnesium alloy ZM21
   is investigated. The microstructure of the original extruded bar
   consists of equiaxed grains with a grain size range of 15-18 mu m. The
   anelasticity was measured using a method in which the elastic modulus in
   every loop is obtained by calculating the slope of lines fitted to the
   loading and unloading parts of the curves. The cyclic test for ZM21
   shows that the anelastic strain increases with the strain, reaching its
   maximum between 2-4\% applied strain and then levels off. The anelastic
   strain reaches a maximum between 2-4\% at which point the fraction of
   extension twins also reaches a maximum. Twins were separated from their
   parent grains in order to quantify twin evolution during cyclic loading.
   Overall, it was found that most of the twins observed are extension
   twins up to 8\% accumulative strain. Beyond 8\% strain, exhaustion of
   90\% of extension twins occurred and contraction twins appeared in the
   microstructure. Moreover, double twins were identified after a strain of
   8\%. These twins were composed of extension twins and contraction twins
   which can contribute to softening. Such softening can result in the
   reduction of uniform elongation in tension for the cyclic loading in
   comparison with the monotonic loading. It was possible for the material
   to sustain continued straining without failure to over double this
   value, that is, 15\%.}},

   investigations on the deformation process of cellular structures with
   gradient topologies under quasi-static loading conditions. The specimens
   used in the tests were designed with the use of a hexagon shape of a
   unit cell with a graded size preserving the equivalent global size and
   wall thickness dimensions. The manufacturing process of structure
   samples was realized by two different 3D printing methods: FFF (Fused
   Filament Fabrication) and SLA (Selective Laser Sintering). Additionally,
   two types of materials differing with mechanical properties were used to
   determine the mechanism of structure damage during the deformation
   process. As a result of the conducted investigations, it was possible to
   define a relationship between a structure topology and relative density
   versus energy absorption capacity.}},

Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the mechanical response of thin sheets perforated with a
   square array of mutually orthogonal cuts, which leaves a network of
   squares connected by small ligaments. Our combined analytical,
   experimental and numerical results indicate that under uniaxial tension
   the ligaments buckle out of plane, inducing the formation of 3D patterns
   whose morphology is controlled by the load direction. We also find that
   by largely stretching the buckled perforated sheets, plastic strains
   develop in the ligaments. This gives rise to the formation of kirigami
   sheets comprising periodic distribution of cuts and permanent folds. As
   such, the proposed buckling-induced pop-up strategy points to a simple
   route for manufacturing complex morphable structures out of flat
   perforated sheets.}},

Title = {{A novel three-dimensional mechanical metamaterial with
   compression-torsion properties}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{226}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{A new design of a 3D compression-torsion mechanical metamaterial is
   proposed based on the chiral mechanism of inclined rods converting axial
   compression (or tension) into torsion. Experiments and numerical
   simulations are employed to investigate the compression-torsion
   properties of the new proposed metamaterial under uniaxial compression.
   Results show that it possesses excellent compression-torsion properties
   compared to previously reported 3D compression-torsion metamaterials.
   Moreover, the torsion angle of the proposed metamaterial under
   compression can maintain a large value even when the transverse cell
   number N = 9. By contrast, the torsion angle of structures reported in
   references declined rapidly with the cell number, and the
   compression-torsion properties nearly vanished when N = 5. These
   outstanding properties of the proposed metamaterial are due to the
   better compression-torsion properties of the unit cell and weaker
   transverse constraint among cells. The latter reason also contributes to
   an interesting phenomenon wherein the torsion angle first increases and
   then declines with the transverse cell number N, which is much different
   from the monotonically decreasing trend of other 3D compression-torsion
   metamaterials. The main factors affecting the compression-torsion
   properties of 3D metamaterials are revealed and discussed in detail,
   shedding light on the design of 3D metamaterial with outstanding
   compression-torsion properties.}},

Abstract = {{A specific periodic bar-and-joint framework with limited degrees of

   exploring the equilibrium paths then reveals a transition state of the
   structure at a critical value of the internal stiffness. A simplified
   formulation of the model with weak nonlinear terms yields an exact
   solution of its transition state. Load-displacement behaviour and

Abstract = {{The complex cellular structure of trabecular bone possesses lightweight

   printed bone-like cellular structure. This is achieved by conducting
   extensive analytical simulations of the bone-inspired unit cell in
   parallel to traverse every possible combination of its key design
   parameters. The analytical framework is validated using experimental
   data and used to evolve the most optimal cellular structure, with the
   maximum energy absorption as the key performance criterion. The design

   structures but there is an ever-increasing interest to use these
   structures for various composite applications. A tubular braid without
   any core undergoes large lateral contraction but when elastic materials
   are inserted in the hollow braids, they can potentially act as
   reinforcement in energy absorbing composites. In this paper, the tensile
   behaviour of tubular braids consisting of an elastic core has been
   predicted based on defined braid geometry, core properties and tensile
   properties of helically undulated strands of filaments. The constituent
   filaments considered here are monofilament type but the proposed tensile
   model of braid-core system has also been extended for low twist
   multifilament yarns with non-hybrid weave. Braid angle is found to be
   the most important design parameter for varying the extensibility of
   braid-core systems. A comparison has been made between the theoretical
   and experimental stress-strain curves of tubular braids consisting of
   elastic core. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sutures are the materials primarily used for closing wounds, and their
   performance is significantly dependent on their mechanical
   characteristics. Thus, their tensile property is a key parameter
   responsible for the success of a suture. In this paper, a simple
   analytical tensile model of braided sutures has been developed based on
   braid geometry, braid kinematics, and constituent monofilament
   properties. The model has accounted for the changes in the braid
   geometry, including braid angle, diameter, and Poisson's ratio. The
   kinematics of the braided suture is analyzed pertaining to monofilament
   locking or jamming in the braid. The model of jamming state of
   monofilaments has been presented, and both braid angle and diameter are
   found to be critical design parameters. The experimental results have
   been compared to the theoretical stress-strain curves of braided
   sutures, and an excellent agreement has been observed between them.}},

Abstract = {{The fatigue life of a high-pressure die-cast alloy, AlSi9Cu3, with

   computationally predict the fatigue life using two different methods.
   First, the fatigue life was predicted using a notch-strain approach
   combined with a Coffin-Manson durability relationship for homogeneous
   material. Second, the fatigue life was predicted using an homogenised
   un-notched model that was combined with an adapted Coffin-Manson
   relationship which considered a fatigue life reduction due to different

Abstract = {{In this work, through the use of Molecular Dynamics simulations, we show
   the capability of different mechanical metamaterials to induce their own
   global rotational motion as a result of an internal deformation. We also
   show that one of the considered structures, i.e. the hexachiral system,
   may manifest a superior extent of the global rotation in comparison to
   other systems. In addition to that, we discuss that the self-induced
   global rotation can be observed for mechanical metamaterials with a
   discrete mass distribution which allows to prove that this phenomenon is
   not limited to macroscopic systems and applications involving the
   control of the rotational motion of objects such as satellites or wind
   turbines where the continuous mass distribution of structural elements
   is normally required. In fact, this study serves as a blueprint to show
   that a similar effect may also be expected for various systems at very
   different scales. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Mechanical Properties of a Novel Zero Poisson's Ratio Honeycomb}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel honeycomb is proposed by embedding a rib into
   every cell of the existing zero Poisson's ratio (ZPR) configuration,
   semi re-entrant honeycomb (SRH). Analytical model is developed to
   investigate the in-plane mechanical properties of the new honeycomb, and
   the resulting theoretical expressions are compared with the experimental
   tests and numerical results obtained from two different finite element
   (FE) models (3D beam model and 3D solid model), leading to a good
   correlation. FE analysis, analytical modeling, and experimental tests of
   the new honeycomb show that it can achieve ZPR effect in two principal
   directions. For further studies, parameters analyses are carried out to
   explore the dependence of the in-plane mechanical properties versus the
   geometric parameters. The results show that bending is the dominated
   deformation model when the new honeycomb is compressed along the x-
   direction, while stretch controlled in the y- directional compression.
   It is remarkable that the new proposed honeycomb features superior
   specific stiffness and more flexible in mechanical properties tailoring
   compared to the other ZPR honeycombs in the literature. Given these
   benefits, the new honeycomb may be promising in some practical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{We review and discuss recent progress in modelling non-linear and
   non-local transport processes in heterogeneous media. The non-locality
   that we consider is caused by long-range correlations that either exist
   in the morphology of the media, or are caused by the transport processes
   themselves. The interplay between the non-linearity and non-locality is
   discussed in depth with the aim of establishing that, often
   non-linearity and non-locality are ``two sides of the same coin{''},
   such that one may have no meaning without the presence of the other one.
   First, we discuss linear and scalar, but non-local transport processes
   and, in particular, consider those in percolation systems with
   long-range correlations. It appears that there are significant
   differences between percolative transport processes in which the
   long-range correlations (or the covariance function) decrease with the
   distance r between two points, and those in which they increase as r
   does. Application of this problem to how and transport in geological
   formations is discussed. We then consider linear vector percolation, one
   type of which, the rigidity percolation, provides an example of a
   non-local vector transport in heterogeneous media. Applications of
   vector percolation to modelling elastic properties of glasses, composite
   solids and rock, mechanical and viscoelastic properties of polymers, and
   vibrations and dynamical properties of heterogeneous materials are
   discussed. Non-linear and non-local scalar transport processes are
   discussed next, including various breakdown phenomena in disordered
   composites, power-law transport, piecewise linear transport
   characterized by a threshold, and non-linear processes that arise as a
   result of imposing a large external potential gradient on a
   heterogeneous medium. Their relevance to flow of non-Newtonian fluids in
   porous media, to electrical currents and dielectric breakdown in
   composite solids and doped polycrystalline semiconductors, and several
   other problems is then discussed. Finally, we discuss non-linear and
   non-local vector transport, the most important example of which is
   mechanical fracture of disordered solids. We discuss exactly solvable
   models of fracture, quasi-static and dynamic lattice models, molecular
   dynamics simulations, and continuum formulation of the problem. In all
   cases, the predictions of the models are compared with the relevant
   experimental data. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of cellular materials continues to increase in
   lightweight structural applications as more industries realize these
   materials are becoming more reliable, repeatable and allowing for lower
   production costs. Among all the common structural applications of
   cellular architected materials, cores for sandwich panels may perhaps be
   the most important one, and therefore, were the focus of this work. On
   the other hand, the fast-paced growth of computational power, in
   combination with the development of software and numerical methods such
   as Meshless Methods provide the necessary conditions to study intricate
   topologies which may offer improved mechanical properties for each
   different application. In this work, two periodic cellular topologies
   which are typically used in the cores of sandwich structures were
   designed, namely conventional honeycombs and re-entrant honeycombs, for
   7 different values of relative density, and tested in two different
   in-plane directions in the linear-elastic domain. The Radial Point
   Interpolation Method (RPIM) is used in this study, for the first time in
   the literature, to simulate the elasto-static behaviour of honeycomb
   structures and provides advantages over the Finite Element Method (FEM)
   in this field.}},

Abstract = {{A large class of phononic crystals and mechanical metamaterials exhibit
   glide symmetry that dictates their functionality or exceptional
   performance. The glide symmetry gives rise to a number of intriguing
   phenomena like sticking-bands and degeneracy in the phononic band
   structures. Fully understanding of these phenomena demands analysis of
   the phonon modes' symmetry property, which is, however, a challenging
   task since it involves nonsymmorphic space group analysis and special
   treatment of the Brillouin zone boundary. Therefore, this work
   introduces a systematic group-theoretical procedure determining the
   symmetry of phonon modes for periodic structures with glide symmetry. By
   taking the p4g group as an example, the symmetry of phonon modes is
   discussed by deriving the small representations for high symmetry
   k-points, and different types of degeneracies are elucidated. This work
   provides insight into the role of glide symmetry on phononic band
   structures and guides the symmetry analysis of periodic structures of
   other types. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In structural design optimization involving transient responses, time
   integration scheme plays a crucial role in sensitivity analysis because
   it affects the accuracy and stability of transient analysis. In this
   work, the influence of time integration scheme is studied numerically
   for the adjoint shape sensitivity analysis of two benchmark transient
   heat conduction problems within the framework of isogeometric analysis.
   It is found that (i) the explicit approach (beta = 0) and semi-implicit
   approach with beta < 0.5 impose a strict stability condition of the
   transient analysis; (ii) the implicit approach (beta = 1) and
   semi-implicit approach with beta > 0.5 are generally preferred for their
   unconditional stability; and (iii) Crank-Nicolson type approach (beta=
   0.5) may induce a large error for large time-step sizes due to the
   oscillatory solutions. The numerical results also show that the
   time-step size does not have to be chosen to satisfy the critical
   conditions for all of the eigen-frequencies. It is recommended to use
   beta approximate to 0.75 for unconditional stability, such that the
   oscillation condition is much less critical than the Crank-Nicolson
   scheme, and the accuracy is higher than a fully implicit approach.}},

Title = {{Chiral Cosserat model for architected materials constructed by
   homogenization}},
Journal = {{MECCANICA}},
Abstract = {{A homogenization methodology for the construction of effective Cosserat
   substitution media for heterogeneous materials is proposed, combining a
   variational principle in linear elasticity with the extended Hill-Mandel
   lemma accounting for the introduced generalized kinematics. A general
   methodology is proposed which can be applied to a wide class of
   architected materials exhibiting such micropolar chiral effects. The
   tensors of effective micropolar moduli are formulated as integrals over
   a representative unit cell utilizing of the displacement localization
   operators, solution of classical and higher-order unit cell problems.
   The proposed method delivers size-independent higher-order effective
   moduli. The effective micropolar moduli of periodic lattice materials
   endowed with chirality and non-centrosymmetry are computed as an
   application of the developed homogenization method. The homogenized
   model is validated by comparing the local and global mechanical
   responses of fully resolved networks with those of plates and macrobeams
   architected with tetrachiral or anti-tetrachiral lattices.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, chiral metamaterials (CMM) were optimized from conceptual
   design to fine design with the effective elastic constants unchanged
   under finite strain. First, through calculation and comparison of
   examples, the unit cell method was selected to compute the effective
   elastic properties of the periodic chiral metamaterials under finite
   strain. Secondly, the conceptual design of chiral metamaterials with
   prescribed Poisson's ratios under finite strain was realized through
   density-based and feature-driven topology optimization. Then, the method
   of moving asymptotes (MMA) was used to solve the optimization problems.
   Based on the optimal configuration, chiral metamaterials with prescribed
   Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli under finite strain were carefully
   designed through shape optimization. Genetic algorithm was used to solve
   the optimization problem. Finally, the optimal models were fabricated by
   3D printing. The optimal design was validated by tensile test results,
   i.e., the designed chiral metamaterials can maintain effective elastic
   properties under large deformation, and the invariance of the effective
   elastic properties depends on the nonlinearity of the flexible chiral
   metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Oblique impact loading conditions are common in automobile collision
   accidents, which strongly influence the energy absorption performance of
   thin-walled structures. In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3-D)
   hexagonal structure-filled crash box with better comprehensive
   crashworthiness under multiple working conditions is proposed. First,
   the finite element models of four 3-D typical cellular structures
   (hexagon structure, re-entrant hexagon structure, star-shape structure,
   double arrow structure) are established. The dynamic responses of four
   structures under different impact angles (from 0 degrees to 30 degrees)
   and impact velocities (from 5 to 15 m/s) are discussed. The results
   reveal that the 3-D hexagonal structure has great advantages in terms of
   the energy absorption at varying inclination angles. Second, the 3-D
   hexagonal structure is filled in the crash box in the form of gradient
   distribution. The multi-island genetic algorithm (MIGA) based on the
   response surface model (RSM) is utilized to explore the optimal design
   of crash box. Compared with the traditional crash box, the optimal 3-D
   hexagonal structure-filled crash box increases 18.9\% in specific energy
   absorption and decreases 21.7\% in maximum peak force, which
   demonstrates great potential for applications in impact engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of the relative
   density and geometric parameters on the homogenised in-plane elasticity
   modulus of a cellular honeycomb structure using analytical and numerical
   approaches.
   Design/methodology/approach In this work, the mechanical behaviour of a
   new design of the honeycomb is analysed through a refined analytical
   model that is developed based on the energy theorems by considering the
   shearing and stretching effects in addition to bending.
   Findings By taking into account the various deformation mechanisms
   (MNT), the obtained results show that the values of elasticity modulus
   are the same for low relative densities, but the difference becomes
   remarkable for higher densities. Moreover, it is difficult to judge the
   effect of the relative density and anisotropy of the cellular structure
   on the values of the homogenised elasticity modulus without considering
   all the three deformation mechanisms in the analytical model. It is
   shown that conventional models overestimate the elasticity modulus,
   especially for high relative densities.
   Originality/value In this paper, a refined model that takes into account
   the three deformation mechanisms (MNT) is developed to predict the
   in-plane elasticity modulus of a honeycomb cellular material. It is
   shown that analytical models that describe the anisotropic behaviour of
   honeycomb cells can be improved by considering the three deformation
   mechanisms, which are bending, stretching, and shearing deformations.}},

Abstract = {{The quasi-static mechanical properties of re-entrant anti-trichiral
   honeycombs made from ABS polymer are studied by both experiments and
   theoretical analysis. The experimental results show that the deformation
   of honeycomb is dominated by the bending of ligaments, the rotation of
   ligaments around the plastic hinges and the rigid rotation of cylinders.
   Based on the deformation mechanism of the cell structures exhibiting in
   experiments, the collapse process of the honeycomb is divided into
   several stages. Theoretical formulas are deduced to predict the crushing
   stress of the re-entrant anti-trichiral honeycombs in each stage, which
   are functions of the honeycomb's global strain, the cells' geometry
   parameters and the properties of the base material. The analytical
   predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results. It is
   revealed that the crushing stress of the honeycomb increases with the
   global strain and the cell-wall thickness while decreases with the
   ligament-length ratio. An optimal value of the cylinders' radius is
   found which will result in the maximum load-carrying capacity of the
   honeycomb. The present work is supposed to shed light on the design and
   fabrication of re-entrant anti-trichiral honeycombs.}},

Abstract = {{The present work is focused on the investigation of tetra-anti-chiral
   structures by means of experimental, numerical, and analytical methods.
   Specimens with different lengths of the ligaments were manufactured by
   laser cutting and were tested under a compressive load to investigate
   the value and evolution of Poisson's ratio. Based on the experimental
   investigation of the material used to manufacture the samples, finite
   element models were developed and solved using Ls-Dyna. Subsequently,
   based on the strain energy approach, an analytical solution for the
   estimate of the Poisson's ratio was derived. The solution is capable of
   estimating the value for structures with various configurations,
   including lengths and thickness of the ligaments. A simple beam finite
   element model was developed and implemented for solving in MATLAB, to
   extend the capabilities for evaluation and design of structures with
   specific parameters. An overall comparison of results is presented,
   showing a good agreement between datasets. The present work might set
   the background for future activities, allowing for a selection of
   individual investigation methods.}},

   develops a novel zero Poisson's ratio cellular structure composed of

   moduli of the structure are studied through a combination of theoretical
   and finite element analysis. Then the maximum global strains are

   show that the in-plane moduli of the cellular structures are several
   orders of magnitude lower than the raw material. The global strains of
   the cellular structures could be over 10 times greater than the raw

Abstract = {{Uniaxial tension of the nanofilm of the FeAl intermetallic alloy has

   the nanofilm is elastically deformed by 37\%. There is a region in the

   tensile stress, which indicates the negative stiffness of the nanofilm
   in this region. The uniform strain with a decrease in the tensile stress
   is unstable thermodynamically, which leads to the appearance domains
   with different elastic strains in the nanofilm. The deformation in the
   unstable region develops due to the domain-wall motion; as a result, the
   domains with a higher strain grow at the expense of the domains with a
   lower strain. A similar deformation mechanism was recently described by
   Savin with coworkers for the DNA molecule.}},

Abstract = {{Topology Optimization (TO) is a powerful numerical technique to
   determine the optimal material layout in a design domain, which has
   accepted considerable developments in recent years. The classic Finite
   Element Method (FEM) is applied to compute the unknown structural
   responses in TO. However, several numerical deficiencies of the FEM
   significantly influence the effectiveness and efficiency of TO. In order
   to eliminate the negative influence of the FEM on TO, IsoGeometric
   Analysis (IGA) has become a promising alternative due to its unique

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of the mechanical response of hexachiral
   honeycombs with transversally curved ligaments under planar uniaxial
   tensile, compressive and shear loads. The impact of the chiral cell
   design parameters on the resulting macroscopic behaviour is assessed
   utilising finite elements calculations. It is shown that the presence of
   ligament curvature permits to attain mechanical responses which are not
   achievable through conventional chiral honeycomb designs. In addition,
   the resulting responses exhibit, for all considered load cases,
   significant tunability through the investigated geometrical design
   parameters. Two chiral lattices with identical geometries, only
   differing in their ligament curvature, were manufactured and
   experimentally tested to validate the finite elements predictions. A
   connection and assembly strategy is presented and utilised, offering a
   fast and robust approach to build larger finite lattice structures
   through 3D printed single basic cells. The hexachiral lattices were
   tested in tension, compression and in-plane shear, showing good
   agreement with the numerical predictions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Trabecular bone possesses a complex hierarchical structure of plate- and
   strut-like elements, which is analogous to structural systems
   encountered in engineering practice. In this work, key structural
   features of trabecular bone are mimicked to uncover effective energy
   dissipation mechanisms under blast loading. To this end, several key
   design parameters were identified to develop a bone-like unit cell. A
   computer script was then developed to automatically generate bone-like
   finite element models with many combinations of these design parameters,
   which were simulated under blast loading. The optimal structure was
   identified and its performance was benchmarked against traditional
   engineered cellular structures, including those with hexagonal,
   re-entrant and square cellular geometries. The bone-like structure
   showed superior performance over its engineered counterparts using the
   peak transmitted reaction force and energy dissipation as the key

Title = {{Flexural wave attenuation in a sandwich beam with viscoelastic periodic
   cores}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{400}},
Pages = {{227-247}},
Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{The flexural-wave attenuation performance of traditional
   constraint-layer damping in a sandwich beam is improved by using
   periodic constrained-layer damping (PCLD), where the monolithic
   viscoelastic core is replaced with two periodically alternating
   viscoelastic cores. Closed-form solutions of the wave propagation
   constants of the infinite periodic sandwich beam and the forced response
   of the corresponding finite sandwich structure are theoretically
   derived, providing computational support on the analysis of attenuation
   characteristics. In a sandwich beam with PCLD, the flexural waves can be
   attenuated by both Bragg scattering effect and damping effect, where the
   attenuation level is mainly dominated by Bragg scattering in the
   band-gaps and by damping in the pass-bands. Affected by these two
   effects, when the parameters of periodic cores are properly selected, a
   sandwich beam with PCLD can effectively reduce vibrations of much lower
   frequencies than that with traditional constrained-layer damping. The
   effects of the parameters of viscoelastic periodic cores on band-gap
   properties are also discussed, showing that the average attenuation in
   the desired frequency band can be maximized by tuning the length ratio
   and core thickness to proper values. The research in this paper could
   possibly provide useful information for the researches and engineers to
   design damping structures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article introduces a computational design framework for obtaining
   three-dimensional (3D) periodic elastoplastic architected materials with
   enhanced performance, subject to uniaxial or shear strain. A nonlinear
   finite element model accounting for plastic deformation is developed,
   where a Lagrange multiplier approach is utilized to impose periodicity
   constraints. The analysis assumes that the material obeys a von Mises
   plasticity model with linear isotropic hardening. The finite element
   model is combined with a corresponding path-dependent adjoint
   sensitivity formulation, which is derived analytically. The optimization
   problem is parametrized using the solid isotropic material penalization
   method. Designs are optimized for either end compliance or toughness for
   a given prescribed displacement. Such a framework results in producing
   materials with enhanced performance through much better utilization of
   an elastoplastic material. Several 3D examples are used to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the mathematical framework.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{189}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In the current work, we demonstrate the potential of structures made of
   chiral artificial materials to balance bending loads through tensile
   loads, exploiting their inner normal to shear strain coupling. To that
   scope, we employ beam structures which we architecture with tetrachiral
   unit-cells. For the latter, we quantify their inherently coupled normal
   to shear strain behavior, making use of homogenization analysis
   techniques. We subsequently derive the equations that characterize the
   bending mechanics of beams with an inner bending to normal loading
   coupling, starting from first principles. Thereupon, we compute the
   normal forces required to equilibrate the effect of bending loads on
   beam structures, providing relevant closed-form parametric expressions.
   Using the derived analytical formulas, we carry out both numerical
   simulations and experiments for the case of cantilever beams. Results
   suggest that the coupling of normal and shear deformations can be used
   as a primal load-balancing mechanism, providing new possibilities in the
   control of the artificial structure's kinematics and overall mechanics.

Abstract = {{We consider a two-dimensional square lattice model extended by

Abstract = {{With the development of three-dimensional printing technologies,
   so-called ``designer materials{''} including re-entrant, chiral, and
   rotating rigid structures have attracted much attention due to unusual
   properties. However, most studies ignore theoretical analysis and pay
   much attention to numerical simulation. In this article, a novel
   re-entrant cellular material is proposed and taken as an example to
   introduce the methods of theoretical study on relations between
   mechanical properties and geometric parameters of this ``designer
   material.{''} This work starts from developing theoretical models of
   relative density using two-dimensional unit cell in terms of three
   geometric parameters: edge length, reentrant distance, and cellular
   thickness. Then, linear-elastic mechanical properties including elastic
   modulus and shear modulus, and nonlinear mechanical properties are
   explored. Based on theoretical models, predominant compression failure
   mode of this material is plastic collapse. Finite element method is
   adopted to identify accuracy of static mechanical models. On this basis,
   dynamic mechanical model is put forward, the relationship of dynamic
   plateau stress and impact velocity, and structural parameters are
   established by empirical formula. Moreover, the relationship of unit
   volume energy absorption and geometric features, impact velocity are
   also established. Eventually, finite element method is utilized to prove
   that simulation results show a well coincidence to theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{We study the lateral deformations of randomly folded elastoplastic and
   predominantly plastic thin sheets under the uniaxial and radial
   compressions. We found that the lateral deformations of cylinders folded
   from elastoplastic sheets of paper obey a power law behavior with the
   universal Poisson's index nu = 0.17 +/- 0.01, which does not depend
   neither the paper kind and sheet sizes (thickness, edge length) nor the
   folding confinement ratio. In contrast to this, the lateral deformations
   of randomly folded predominantly plastic aluminum foils display the
   linear dependence on the axial compression with the universal Poisson's
   ratio nu(e) = 0.33 +/- 0.01. This difference is consistent with the
   difference in fractal topology of randomly folded elastoplastic and
   predominantly plastic sheets, which is found to belong to different
   universality classes. The general form of constitutive
   stress-deformation relations for randomly folded elastoplastic sheets is
   suggested.}},

Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{106}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Two innovative re-entrant hierarchical sandwich panels constructed by
   substituting the cell walls of re-entrant honeycombs with isotropic
   regular hexagon substructure (RHH) and equilateral triangle substructure
   (RHT) are proposed in this paper, and their crashworthiness performance
   has been investigated systematically. Based on the Euler beam theory,
   the Young's moduli of units of re-entrant hierarchical sandwich panels
   are derived. A comparison between the re-entrant hierarchical sandwich
   panels and re-entrant sandwich panel has been conducted to study their
   energy absorption ability. Furthermore, the parametric analysis based on
   numerical analysis has been carried out to discuss the effects of the
   gradient, arranged orientation of hierarchical sandwich cores and the
   impact velocities. Results show that both the two proposed sandwich
   panels can greatly improve the in-plane stiffness and the energy
   absorption capacity, and the energy absorption mechanisms are discussed.
   In addition, the graded sandwich panels can effectively reduce initial
   peak force under quasi-static compression, and the configuration of
   large- medium -small (LMS) performs the best under high impact velocity.
   The cross-arranged cores can significantly improve the impact resistance
   ability of RHT sandwich panels. This work provides a new solution for
   designing lightweight sandwich structures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

   dynamic loading}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{141}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This study aims to explore the crushing behavior of aluminum (AL) -
   carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) tubes with different hybrid
   configurations subjected to quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions.
   First, a series of experimental tests are carried out to explore the
   crushing behaviors of hybrid tubes in comparison with the corresponding
   individual tubes made of single material. The experimental results
   indicate that the H-II hybrid tube, made of an outer aluminum circular
   tube and internally adhered CFRP layers, generates a unique deformation
   pattern; whose outer aluminum tube inverses externally and inner CFRP
   layers crush progressively. With these distinctive deformation features,
   the H-II hybrid tubes are considered to be ideal with superior
   crashworthiness and energy-absorbing capacity. It is also found that
   loading rate has little influence on deformation pattern of hybrid tubes
   and single material tubes, while energy-absorbing capacity of hybrid
   tubes and individual CFRP tubes under dynamic loading are substantially
   lower than those under quasi-static loading. Second, numerical
   simulations are performed for the H-II hybrid tubes to provide further
   insights into their underlying energy-absorbing mechanisms. It is found
   that the external inversion mode of the outer aluminum tube is the major
   energy-absorbing mechanism, in which the contribution of the outer
   aluminum tube to total energy absorption decreases with increase in
   thickness of CFRP layers. The internal energy of the externally inversed
   aluminum tube is considerably higher than internal energy of typical
   progressively-folded AL tube (sole aluminum tube). Third, a parametric
   study is further conducted, which indicates that with increasing
   aluminum wall thickness, the specific energy absorption (SEA) increases.
   Besides, it is found that varying fiber orientation of inner CFRP layers
   leads to no evident change in the deformation mode and SEA of the H-II
   hybrid tubes. When the interfacial strength in between aluminum and CFPR
   reaches a certain level, there is no evident increase in the total
   energy absorption with further increase of the interface strength, but
   the initial peak crushing force increases notably. These results are
   expected to deepen the understanding of crushing behavior of the H-II
   hybrid tubes, thereby providing guidance for the crashworthiness design.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{269-277}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The presence of extremely large negative linear compressibilities (NLC)
   in crystalline silver oxalate was discovered in a recent work by using
   first principles solid-state calculations. Although the minimum value of
   the NLC was found for a negative applied hydrostatic pressure, in this
   work the presence of NLC in this material for positive applied pressures
   is verified experimentally by means of high-pressure X-ray diffraction
   experiments performed at room temperature in the Beijing synchrotron
   radiation facility. The results of this study demonstrate with certainty
   that the compressibility of silver oxalate along {[}010]
   crystallographic direction is negative for applied pressures in the
   range from 0.0 to 0.85 GPa. Since the measured compressibility decreases
   largely as the pressure decreases, large negative values of the
   compressibility are expected for negative applied pressures in agreement
   with the results found using first principles methods. Furthermore, the
   analysis of the variation of the lattice parameters of the crystal
   structure of silver oxalate under pressure in the principal axes
   reference system revealed that this material also exhibits the largest
   negative area compressibility phenomenon found so far at zero pressure,
   the values of the compressibilities along two of the principal axes
   being - 16.7 and - 20.0 TPa-1. The negative compressibility phenomenon
   in silver oxalate can be rationalized in terms of a ``chains of rotating
   parallelograms'' structural model.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{128}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we proposed a new material design method by
   microstructure topology optimization. Novelty of the proposed method is
   to target the whole nonlinear volume-averaged effective stress-strain
   curve of microstructure representative volume element (RVE) rather than
   aiming specific values such as strength, stiffness or Poisson ratio. J2
   plasticity model with a linear isotropic hardening model was chosen for
   local residuals. Global residuals are computed within nonlinear finite
   element framework for the topology optimization. Sensitivities of the
   objective function augmented with the residuals and adjoint response
   vectors with respect to design variables are derived with details and
   their numerical computational procedures were also presented.
   Microstructure topologies showing two different targeted stress-strain
   curves under uniaxial and biaxial loadings were obtained by using the
   method of moving asymptotes (MMA) optimization algorithm. Accuracy of
   the sensitivity computations was verified and numerical examples
   demonstrated a potential of the proposed method in applications to
   multiscale topology optimization.}},

Title = {{Crashworthiness analysis of thin-walled bio-inspired multi-cell
   corrugated tubes under quasi-static axial loading}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{204}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a bio-inspired multi-cell corrugated tube for use in
   energy absorption. The proposed structure consists of two parts: an
   inner rib and a corrugated tube into which the inner rib is inserted.
   The structure of the corrugated tube is specified using a cosine
   expression based on two parameters, that is, the number of cosine wave
   crests and their amplitude. Two inner ribs with different sections
   (X-shaped and Y-shaped) were designed and the crashworthiness of the
   resulting tubes was analyzed. The crashworthiness was determined using
   the finite-element program LS-DYNA. The numerical results show that the
   modes of collapse of the multi-cell corrugated tubes can be classified
   into four types: unstable, diamond, ring, and mixed modes. Each mode is
   strongly affected by the number of cosine wave crests and their
   amplitude. By analyzing the force-displacement performance and
   crashworthiness indicators, it was found that tubes with appropriate
   number of wave crests and amplitudes, and inner rib shape experience
   lower initial peak forces and increase energy absorption and specific
   energy absorption (compared with a traditional straight tube with the
   same inner rib). The undulation in the load-carrying capacity is also
   decreased. Thus, the multi-cell corrugated tubes have good
   crashworthiness.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{20}},

Abstract = {{The equation of state, elastic constants, and Poisson's ratio of a
   crystalline two-dimensional polydisperse hard disk system were
   determined in the close packing limit. Monte Carlo simulations in the
   NpT ensemble with variable shape of the periodic box reveal that the
   pressure and elastic constants grow with increasing polydispersity. The
   equation of state and the bulk modulus are well described by the free
   volume approximation. The latter approximation fails, however, for the
   shear modulus. The simulations also show that the introduction of any
   amount of size polydispersity in the hard disk systems causes a
   discontinuous ``jump{''} of the Poisson's ratio in the close packing
   limit from the value nu(delta=0) = 0.1308(22), obtained for equidiameter
   hard disks, to nu(delta>0) approximate to 1, estimated for the
   polydisperse disks. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{With the help of molecular dynamics simulations, delocalized nonlinear
   vibrational modes (DNVM) in graphene are analyzed. Such modes are
   dictated by the lattice symmetry, they are exact solutions to the atomic
   equations of motion, regardless the employed interatomic potential and
   for any mode amplitude (though for large amplitudes they are typically
   unstable). In this study, only one- and two-component DNVM are analyzed,
   they are reducible to the dynamical systems with one and two degrees of
   freedom, respectively. There exist 4 one-component and 12 two-component
   DNVM with in-plane atomic displacements. Any two-component mode includes
   one of the one-component modes. If the amplitudes of the modes
   constituting a two-component mode are properly chosen, periodic in time
   vibrations are observed for the two degrees of freedom at frequencies
   omega and 2 omega, that is, second harmonic generation takes place. For
   particular DNVM, the higher harmonic can have frequency nearly two times
   larger than the maximal frequency of the phonon spectrum of graphene.
   Excitation of some of DNVM results in the appearance of negative
   in-plane pressure in graphene. This counterintuitive result is explained
   by the rotational motion of carbon hexagons. Our results contribute to
   the understanding of nonlinear dynamics of the graphene lattice.}},

   microstructure. With reference to the Floquet-Bloch spectrum, focus is
   made on the band structure enrichments and modifications which can be
   achieved by equipping the cellular microstructure with tunable local
   resonators. By virtue of its composite mechanical nature, the so-built
   inertial meta-material gains enhanced capacities of passive
   frequency-band filtering. Indeed the number, placement and properties of
   the inertial resonators can be designed to open, shift and enlarge the
   band gaps between one or more pairs of consecutive branches in the
   frequency spectrum. In order to improve the meta-material performance,
   several nonlinear optimization problems are formulated. The largest
   among the band gap amplitudes in the low-frequency range is selected as
   suited objective function. Proper inequality constraints are introduced
   to restrict the admissible solutions within a compact set of mechanical
   and geometric parameters, including only physically realistic properties
   of both the lattice and the resonators. The optimization problems
   related to full and partial band gaps are solved by using a globally
   convergent version of the numerical method of moving asymptotes,
   combined with a quasi Monte Carlo multi-start technique. The optimal
   solutions are numerically computed, discussed and compared from, the
   qualitative and quantitative viewpoints, bringing to light the limits
   and potential of the meta-material performance. The clearest trends
   emerging from the numerical analyses are pointed out and interpreted
   from the physical viewpoint. Finally, some specific recommendations
   about the microstructural design of the meta-material are synthesized.

Abstract = {{In this paper, a protect system consists of a re-entrant hexagon
   honeycomb cored sandwich panel and a homogenous steel plate was firstly
   proposed. The parametric study including boundary conditions, geometric
   and thickness parameters of the protect system was conducted. It was
   found that, under the presented set-up, the boundary conditions did not
   affect the energy absorption of the protect system, they only altered
   the internal energy distribution among the protect system. Finally, a
   novel multi-scale optimization was conducted to further improve the
   performance of the protect system. Another conventional multi-objective
   optimization was also conducted for comparison. The results showed that,
   by affording less computational effort, the multi-scale optimization
   improved the ASEA (areal specific energy absorption) by 4.9\% and
   reduced MaxD (maximum displacement) by 1.8\%, comparing to the
   conventional multi-objective optimization.}},

Title = {{Crushing behavior and deformation mechanism of randomly honeycomb
   cylindrical shell structure}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{151}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Honeycomb structure, which presents potential ability in energy
   absorption and impact resistance, has advantages of simplicity,
   lightweight, easy manufacturing and designability. In this study,
   honeycomb structure panel is expanded to cylindrical shell by adopting
   the rolled-up algorithm and the crushing behaviors of the randomly
   honeycomb cylindrical shell (RHCS) structures are investigated under
   axial loading. The influence of geometrical and topological parameters,
   i.e. the thickness-to-diameter ratio, cell irregularity, relative
   density on the deformation evolution and energy absorption performance
   is systematically performed. It is found that the deformation modes of
   RHCS structures are significantly affected by thickness-to-diameter
   ratio and cell irregularity. Moreover, the rate-independent,
   rigid-plastic hardening (R-PH) idealisation with two parameters is
   adopted to characterize the crushing responses of RHCS structures and
   the parameters are quantified as power-law relations with respect to
   relative density. Further, the crushing behaviors of density-graded RHCS
   structures with continuously varying in density are carried out under
   different impact velocities. Results indicated that the introduction of
   density gradients can strongly affect the deformation mode, crushing
   force and energy absorption performance of density-graded RHCS
   structures. Combining with analysis of crushing front propagation, the
   theoretical determination of crushing responses of the density-graded
   RHCS under different loading rates is presented based on R-PH model. The
   results of predicted crushing force-time histories of density-graded
   RHCS structures show versatile agreement with that of finite element
   values at both impact and support ends. Additionally, the energy
   absorption capacity that is related to deformation mechanisms of
   density-graded RHCS structures is investigated.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effective elastic constants of several 2D and 3D
   frame-like periodic cellular solids with different unit-cell topologies
   are analytically derived using the homogenization method based on
   equivalent strain energy. The analytical expressions of strain energy of
   a unit cell under different strain modes are determined using a generic
   symbolic object-oriented finite element (FE) program written in MATLAB.
   The obtained analytical expressions of the strain energy are then used
   to symbolically compute the effective elastic constants that include
   Young's moduli, Poisson's ratios, and shear moduli. The obtained
   analytical effective elastic constants are numerically verified using
   results from an ordinary numerical FE program. The obtained closed-form
   effective elastic constants are also compared with some existing
   solutions from the literature. This study demonstrates that symbolic
   computation platforms can be properly used to provide efficient
   methodologies for finding useful analytical solutions of mechanical
   problems. Without the symbolic object-oriented FE program in this study,
   elaborate and tedious analytical analysis has to be manually performed
   for each different unit cell. The symbolic object-oriented FE program
   provides analytical analysis of unit cells that is accurate and fast.
   The object-oriented programming technique allows the symbolic FE program
   in this study to be efficiently implemented.}},

Abstract = {{This work features a multi-stiffness topology optimization of a zero
   Poisson's ratio cellular structure for morphing skin applications. The
   optimization is performed with stiffness constraints to minimize the
   weight by using a state-of-the-art solid isotropic microstructure with

   minimize flatwise compressive and transverse shear moduli for
   aerodynamic pressures and shear forces. The multi-stiffness topology
   optimization is performed using a norm method with weighting
   coefficients. Both the single-stiffness and the multi-stiffness topology
   optimization have generated new honeycomb design by imposing symmetry
   conditions and geometric post-processing to avoid the presence of stress
   concentrations. The mechanical performances of the new honeycomb designs
   are validated using two approaches: one based on force boundary
   conditions (HyperWorks) and another with displacement BCs (ANSYS). The
   work shows some alternate potential topologies and configurations of

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an in-plane negative area compressibility (NAC)
   material not due to Lifshitz mode, but due to all around in-plane
   pressure. The NAC system consists of an array of two-dimensional
   material in the form of n-sided polygon with n/2 number of connecting
   rods, where n is an even number. Two types of NAC microstructural
   geometries are introduced herein: 8-sided polygon in square array and
   6-sided polygon in hexagonal array. The polygons are permitted to change
   in shape - and hence change in area - at constant side lengths with
   accompanying translational motion of the connecting rods, thereby
   changing the overall area of the cell. Results reveal that negative
   compressibility is observed in the square array NAC when the material
   shape is in between a regular octagon and a square, and in the hexagonal
   array NAC when the material shape is in between a regular hexagon and an
   equilateral triangle.}},

   crystals such as graphene and graphane and in 3D crystals such as alkali
   halide crystals and pure metals. The possible role of DB in solid state
   physics and materials science is discussed. Stroboscopic picture of
   atomic motions in the vicinity of discrete breather excited in graphene
   homogeneously strained with E-xx=0.3, E-yy=-0.1. Displacements of atoms
   from the equilibrium lattice positions are multiplied by the factor 4
   for clarity. The discrete breather is of high spatial localization, so
   that only two atoms oscillate with a large amplitude. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Elastic constants and the Poisson ratio of the fcc hard-sphere
   crystalline phases, free of defects and with vacancies, are determined
   by two Monte Carlo methods: (i) the analysis of the box fluctuations in
   the constant pressure ensemble with variable box shape (N-P-T) and (ii)
   by the free-energy differentiation with respect to deformation in the
   fixed box ensemble (N-V-T). Very good agreement is observed for the
   extrapolated to the infinitely large system limit results of both the
   methods. The coefficients of the leading singularities of the elastic
   constants near close packing are estimated; they are well described by
   the free volume approximation. Two mechanisms influencing the Poisson
   ratio are studied. (i) It is shown that at high densities particle
   motions decrease the Poisson ratio with respect to the static case which
   corresponds to zero temperature. Simulations performed for systems of
   soft spheres, interacting through n-inverse-power potentials, r(-n),
   show that the elastic constants of the hard spheres can be obtained in
   the limit n ->infinity. When T -> 0 the elastic constants of the soft
   spheres tend to those of the static model. (ii) It is also shown that
   vacancies decrease C(11) and C(44) and increase C(12) and, hence,
   increase the Poisson ratio with respect to the defect-free state of the
   system. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in additive manufacturing techniques have motivated
   an increasing number of researchers to study regular porous biomaterials
   that are based on repeating unit cells. The physical and mechanical
   properties of such porous biomaterials have therefore received
   increasing attention during recent years. One of the areas that have
   revived is analytical study of the mechanical behavior of regular porous
   biomaterials with the aim of deriving analytical relationships that
   could predict the relative density and mechanical properties of porous
   biomaterials, given the design and dimensions of their repeating unit
   cells. In this article, we review the analytical relationships that have
   been presented in the literature for predicting the relative density,
   elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield stress, and buckling limit of
   regular porous structures based on various types of unit cells. The
   reviewed analytical relationships are used to compare the mechanical
   properties of porous biomaterials based on different types of unit
   cells. The major areas where the analytical relationships have improved
   during the recent years are discussed and suggestions are made for
   future research directions. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

Abstract = {{Metamaterials are featured by artificial composite structures with
   exotic properties, which process promising application potentials in
   various areas. However, the manufacturing of metamaterials faces great
   challenges due to the structural complexity, accuracy requirement, and
   small scale. Additive manufacturing (AM), as a layer-by-layer technique,
   shows intrinsic advantages in the fabrication of metamaterials. This
   paper extensively reviews the current state on how and to what extent AM
   techniques are adopted for metamaterials fabrication, in which the
   metamaterials are mainly classified into mechanical, acoustic and
   electromagnetic types. More importantly, the challenges and research
   opportunities are discussed for AM fabrication of metamaterials, with
   focus on high precision, multi-structural and multi-material, topology
   optimization, support structure, anisotropy and heterogeneity, residual
   stresses and application realization. It is expected that with further
   innovative solutions being developed to bridge the research gaps, the
   industries will become more confident to adopt metamaterials in devices

Abstract = {{A traditional aircraft is optimized for only one or two flight
   conditions, not for the entire flight envelope. In contrast, the wings
   of a bird can be reshaped to provide optimal performance at all flight
   conditions. Any change in an aircraft's configuration, in particular the
   wings, affects the aerodynamic performance, and optimal configurations
   can be obtained for each flight condition. Morphing technologies offer
   aerodynamic benefits for an aircraft over a wide range of flight
   conditions. The advantages of a morphing aircraft are based on an
   assumption that the additional weight of the morphing components is
   acceptable. Traditional mechanical and hydraulic systems are not
   considered good choices for morphing aircraft. Smart materials and
   structures have the advantages of high energy density, ease of control,
   variable stiffness, and the ability to tolerate large amounts of strain.
   These characteristics offer researchers and designers new possibilities
   for designing morphing aircraft. In this article, recent developments in
   the application of smart materials and structures to morphing aircraft
   are reviewed. Specifically, four categories of applications are
   discussed: actuators, sensors, controllers, and structures.}},

Abstract = {{This article concludes some of the important observation regarding
   quasi-static and dynamic crushing response of honeycomb structure
   carried out by authors and addressed in the literature. The behaviour of
   honeycomb structure has been reported through experimentation,

   node length, cell size and loading has been studied in detail leading to
   some important findings which have not been addressed earlier. The
   crushing responses of honeycomb structure have been studied in both
   out-of-plane and in-plane loading condition. Moreover, its bending
   behaviour has also been reported in few studies. Geometrical core
   configuration and geometric property like cell size, cell wall thickness
   and node length etc. play a defining role in administrating potential of
   honeycomb. Relative density was a vital property of honeycomb dependent
   on cell configuration and geometric properties. Facesheet material and
   thickness majorly effects the energy absorption capability of the core
   during dynamic projectile and impulsive impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous application of composite layers and steel bars/wires may
   considerably increase buckling strength of the civil structures. In the
   present paper, influence of the material heterogeneity on snap-through
   and snap-back post-buckling behaviors of the steel-wire-reinforced
   hybrid functionally graded orthotropic shallow cylindrical panels is
   investigated. In this regard, various arrangements are adopted for the
   steel-wires to constitute 3D (simultaneous radial, circumferential, and
   axial) gradations of the materials within some layers in addition to
   using some traditional composite layers in between. The non-linear
   governing equations of post-buckling are derived based on the principle
   of minimum potential energy. Sanders' shell theory is utilized to ensure
   that the results are reliable in the deep post-buckling region. A
   nonlinear finite element scheme is employed to trace the post-buckling
   paths using the modified arc-length method. Finally, some parametric
   studies in terms of material arrangement, size of the embedded steel
   wires, the overall lamination scheme, and geometric parameters of the
   shell are performed. Results emphasize the significant effects of the
   steel wires on the post-buckling strength and indicate the advantage of
   using steel fibers with exponential or uniform longitudinal
   distributions and linear transverse distribution, for weight
   optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion pouch battery (LIPB) is widely applied in different
   engineering fields, such as electric vehicles, aeronautics,
   astronautics, and among others. However, few complete mechanical models
   with deformation field are presented to predict internal short circuit
   (ISC) and resistance exterior force property of LIPB under exterior
   loading. In the present research, the indentation theoretical models
   with sinusoidal shape function are established to investigate resistance
   exterior force property of batteries with different positive materials
   under different punch shapes loading. The effects of indentation
   displacement and deformation region on indentation force are carried
   out. By the comparison of indentation force, present theoretical and
   numerical results are consistent with previous experimental results. The
   indentation force increases with the punch radius increase, but
   decreases with the indentation displacement increase. On the basis of
   energy conservation law, it is concluded that LIPB is more likely to
   produce mechanical failure and ISC when normalized deformation region is
   greater than or equal to 0.4 and plastic strain energy ratio is greater
   than or equal to 1.5. In addition, from resistance exterior force
   property point of view, LIPB has a better property to resist external
   force when LiMnNiCoO2, rather than LiCoO2 and Nanophosphate, is used as
   positive material. The research provides a reference for assessing the
   safety of LIPB and selecting suitable positive material, which possesses

Abstract = {{Honeycomb is considered an excellent structural material because of its
   high strength and shear rigidity, excellent energy absorbing property,
   high impact strength, lower weight, high crushing stress, and almost
   constant crushing force. Honeycomb being a cellular solid is a
   well-known core used to build a sandwich structure while making
   structural composites. Because of this excellent mechanical performance,
   honeycombs are frequently used in the aircraft industry as a core of
   sandwich panels and in the automotive industry as efficient impact
   attenuators. The hollow spaces in the honeycomb structure reduce weight
   but also ensure required strength, provided they are designed correctly.
   3D woven honeycomb composite has a promising future in the lightweight
   application areas and can be the real substitutes for aluminum and other
   metal alloys as these structures provide structural integrity. In this
   review, the basic concept of textile-based 3D woven honeycomb
   composites, engineering design, manufacturing process,
   structure-properties relationship, and applications of 3D woven
   honeycomb fabrics and their composites are discussed in detail.
   Geometrical modeling of 3D woven honeycomb fabric and theoretical
   analysis of impact, flexural, and compression behavior of their
   composites are summarized to appreciate the potential advantages of
   textile-based honeycomb structural composites.}},

Title = {{Additive manufacturing meta-functional composites for engineered bridge
   bearings: A review}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{One of the most important causes of bridge failure is the design and
   structural deficiencies of bridge bearings. Recently, typical bridge
   bearings with the reinforcement of steel or fibre have been widely used
   in base isolation system. Especially for fibre-reinforced rubber
   bearings, they offer numerous benefits as higher stiffness and strength,
   more flexibility, and decrease of transport and fabrication costs. Under
   vibration, common bridge bearings cannot perform well and the materials
   used in the bearings cannot sustain under environmental conditions. To
   develop the performance of these common bearings to obtain their
   superior physical and mechanical properties (e.g. lightweight, higher
   stiffness, better impact resistence, and vibration attenuation), the use
   of metamaterials (periodic structures) in the bearings is considered for
   this reason. The current paper is the world's first to present a
   comprehensive, state-of-the-art overview of the development of
   meta-functional composites for bridge bearing applications, exposed to
   both static and dynamic conditions. Also, the paper shows an approach to
   fabricate meta-functional composite bridge bearings via additive
   manufacturing (AM) technologies. Furthermore, the numerical simulation
   has been conducted to enable new insights into the behavior of a
   meta-functional bridge bearing suitable for real-life practial
   applications. These insights are fundamental to the performance
   bench-marking including the development of vibration-based condition
   monitoring and inspection for predictive bridge component maintenance.

Title = {{Tablet-level origin of toughening in abalone shells and translation to
   synthetic composite materials}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Nacre, the iridescent material in seashells, is one of many natural
   materials employing hierarchical structures to achieve high strength and
   toughness from relatively weak constituents. Incorporating these
   structures into composites is appealing as conventional engineering
   materials often sacrifice strength to improve toughness. Researchers
   hypothesize that nacre's toughness originates within its
   brick-and-mortar-like microstructure. Under loading, bricks slide
   relative to each other, propagating inelastic deformation over
   millimeter length scales. This leads to orders-of-magnitude increase in
   toughness. Here, we use in situ atomic force microscopy fracture
   experiments and digital image correlation to quantitatively prove that
   brick morphology (waviness) leads to transverse dilation and subsequent
   interfacial hardening during sliding, a previously hypothesized dominant
   toughening mechanism in nacre. By replicating this mechanism in a
   scaled-up model synthetic material, we find that it indeed leads to
   major improvements in energy dissipation. Ultimately, lessons from this
   investigation may be key to realizing the immense potential of widely
   pursued nanocomposites.}},

Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{471-479}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, buckling analysis of two-directionally porous beam is
   conducted. Based on the available results of Young's modulus and mass
   density via Gaussian random field theory, a new two-directionally porous
   beam model is developed. With the help of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory
   and minimum total potential energy principle, the equilibrium equations
   for nonlinear and linear buckling are derived. The numerical solutions
   of critical buckling loads for different porosity distribution patterns
   can be obtained by generalized differential quadrature method. The final
   numerical results exhibit that more porosities near the middle surface
   or the two edges of beam can lead to a larger critical buckling load
   when the same total volume fraction of porosity is in different porosity
   distribution patterns. The effect of porosity distribution in thickness
   direction is more dominated on the critical buckling load than that of
   the axial porosity distribution. Moreover, the critical buckling load
   becomes more sensitive to aspect ratio of beam and total volume fraction
   of the porosity when increasing mode number. The critical buckling load
   of two-directionally porous beam depends not only on bending coefficient
   (like the one-directionally porous beam), but also on first and second
   derivatives of the bending coefficient. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
