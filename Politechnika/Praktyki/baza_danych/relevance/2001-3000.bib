Abstract = {{A combined method of a genetic algorithm and finite element stress
   analysis has been developed to design the structure of materials. The
   genetic algorithm is applied to searching structures that have a desired
   property by combining it with the finite element analysis, which is used
   to predict the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio. The calculation of
   the stress analysis is validated from the comparison with the theory on
   parallel, series, and random structures. The combined method was applied
   to two searches of structures. One was to find structures that have a
   desired elastic modulus, respectively. The calculation successfully
   found a proper structure for each desired elastic modulus. The other was
   the search of the structure that shows a negative Poisson's ratio. A
   structure having the negative Poisson's ratio was generated by the
   calculation. Although this original structure would appear to have no
   features, it gave us a good idea for the design of materials by
   investigating the stress distribution in the original structure. A new
   structure that consists of a unique and continuous pattern of the higher
   elastic component was designed from the calculation. The reason for the
   negative Poisson's ratio is explained by mechanical linkage. (C) 2001

Title = {{Determining the elastic constants of hydrocarbons of heavy oil products
   using molecular dynamics simulation approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{124-130}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We have performed a molecular dynamics study in order to verify the
   assumption that saturated hydrocarbons can be characterized by
   generalized Hook's law using the fourth rank tensor of elastic
   constants. In this study normal paraffins were treated as crystals of
   hexagonal symmetry. Thus, we obtained original numerical values of
   Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in both anisotropic and isotropic
   planes and the values of the shear modulus at three different
   temperatures.
   Negative Poisson's ratio of n-paraffins is of a particular interest. The
   author believes that auxetic behavior of saturated hydrocarbons is the
   result of their liquid-crystalline nature. Another remarkable point is
   the non-linear elasticity of n-paraffins detected in a wide temperature
   range. This provides an additional experimental confirmation of the
   phase transition process of hydrocarbons earlier reported in scientific
   works.
   We have shown that the matrix of elasticity of a particular heavy
   petroleum product can be estimated using the elastic parameters of the
   n-paraffins obtained. The numerical values of five independent elastic
   constants are directly proportional to the composition of a heavy
   petroleum product. The simplified representation of the composition can
   be defined by a few saturated hydrocarbons with different carbon
   numbers.
   The numerical results obtained in this research may be useful for those
   interested in heavy petroleum fractions rheology as well as those who
   perform numerical studies in petroleum hydrodynamics and acoustics. (C)

Abstract = {{A parametric beam lattice model is formulated to analyze the propagation
   properties of elastic in-plane waves in an auxetic material based on a
   hexachiral topology of the periodic cell, equipped with inertial local
   resonators. The Floquet-Bloch boundary conditions are imposed on a
   low-order linear model, suitably reduced to the only dynamically active
   degrees-of-freedom through a quasistatic stiffness condensation. Since
   the resonators can be designed to open and shift band gaps, an optimal
   design, focused on the largest possible gap in the low-frequency range,
   is achieved by solving a maximization problem in the bounded space of
   the significant geometrical and mechanical parameters. A local optimized
   solution, for the lowest pair of consecutive dispersion curves, is found
   by employing the globally convergent version of the method of moving
   asymptotes, combined with Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo multi-start

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials possess special applications due to their unique
   negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs). As a classic 2D carbon material, the
   NPR of graphene is still deliberated. Introducing the NPR in graphene
   would increase its extraordinary properties, and the NPR together with
   other properties would bring more significant applications for graphene.
   In this Letter, on the basis of first-principles calculations, we
   reconfigure the structure of graphene, and, as an example, we propose a
   new 2D planar carbon allotrope, xgraphene, which is constructed by 5-6-7
   carbon rings. Our theoretical calculations indicate that xgraphene has
   an NPR and constitutes a broad spectrum of metal ion battery anodes with
   high performance. Its maximum storage capacities are 930/1302/744/1488
   mAh/g for Li/Na/K/Ca-ion batteries. It has low metal-ion diffusion
   energy barriers (<= 0.49 eV) and low average open-circuit voltages (<=
   0.53 V). Our density functional theory results also showed that it is
   intrinsically metallic and possesses dynamic, thermal, and mechanical
   stabilities. Its intrinsic NPR, which stems from the weakness of
   coupling of carbon-carbon bonds, is found upon loading the uniaxial
   strain along the armchair direction. This work not only opens up a new
   direction for the design of the next-generation broad-spectrum
   energy-storage materials with low cost and high performance but also
   offers a class application for auxetic materials.}},

   configuration. In addition, a finite element model was developed to
   evaluate the loss factors and natural frequencies regarding different

Abstract = {{Bulky sp(2)-carbon Schwarzites with negative Gaussian curvature are
   promising structures for practical applications due to their unique
   properties such as high surface area, large porosity, and stability
   against graphitization. Herein, a comprehensive study on the tension,
   compression and shear mechanical characteristics of seven triply
   periodic carbon Schwarzite foams with distinct topologies is performed
   using reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. All carbon
   Schwarzites exhibit unique thermal and mechanical properties that are
   markedly dictated by the topology. One of the structures presents a
   negative thermal expansion coefficient. Under uniaxial tension, the
   temperature is able to play a positive or negative role in the tensile
   stiffness, and there is no apparent positive relationship between
   tensile strength and mass density. Subjected to compression and shear
   loads, carbon Schwarzites can fail due to brittle fracture, and uniform
   and stepwise structural instabilities. Both compression- and
   tension-negative Poisson's ratios are revealed to originate from a
   curvature-flattening deformation mechanism. Analysis of the crush force
   efficiency, the stroke efficiency and the energy-absorption demonstrates
   that carbon Schwarzites are effective energy-absorbers. This study
   provides a fundamental understanding of the relationship between the
   topology and mechanical properties of carbon Schwarzites for designing
   3D graphitic nanostructures with good mechanical performances.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{A combination of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene in the form of
   macroscopic hybrid buckypaper (HBP), exhibits a unique set of properties
   that can be exploited for many emerging applications. Here, we present a
   simple, inexpensive and scalable approach for the synthesis of highly
   conductive auxetic graphene/CNT HBP via wet-filtration-zipping and
   demonstrate the electrical, electrochemical and mechanical performance
   (tensile, mode I and mode III fracture) of synthesized HBP. An overall
   increase in electrical conductivity of 247\% is observed for HBP (50
   wt.\% graphene and 50 wt.\% CNT) as compared to BP (100 wt.\% CNT) due
   to effective electronic percolation through the graphene and CNT. As a
   negative electrode for lithium-ion batteries, HBP shows 50\% higher
   gravimetric specific capacity and 89\% lower charge transfer resistance
   relative to BP. The graphene content in the HBP influences the
   mechanical performance providing an auxetic structure to HBP with large
   negative Poisson's ratio. The facile green-chemistry approach reported
   here can be readily applied to any other 1D and 2D materials and solves
   key challenges associated with existing buckypaper manufacturing
   methods. The potential of the synthesis method to integrate with current
   cellulose paper manufacturing technology and its scalability demonstrate
   the novelty of the work for industrial scale production.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative honeycomb-based structures have been paid substantial
   attention in recent years due to their superb mechanical performances
   and specific functions. The presented study made acomprehensive overview
   on the development of the innovative honeycomb-based structures in the
   past two decades, including filled-type, embedded, tandem, hierarchical,
   auxetics with Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR), etc. Mechanical
   performances of these structures were commented with advantages and
   disadvantages, related on their geometric configurations, mechanical
   performance and dynamic response, respectively. The challenges as well
   as future directions were also analyzed. The achievements provide
   significant guidelines in designing of new generation light-weight
   honeycomb-based structures.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic cloaks enable exciting object concealment by manipulating sound
   waves and have attracted research efforts from different approaches such
   as transformation acoustics. However, the challenge still lies in the
   practical implementation of those cloaks that require complex material
   designs. Here, we show that an underwater acoustic cloak can be
   automatically achieved by deforming a soft mechanical metamaterial with
   Poisson's ratio of -1. The deformation of such an auxetic structure is
   demonstrated to be able to automatically and passively fulfill the
   requirement of quasi-conformal mapping for cloak design. Such a
   self-adaptive acoustic cloak exhibits a wide frequency and angular
   bandwidth, which opens an avenue for convenient design of various kinds
   of acoustic metamaterials. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Higher-order global-local theory with novel 3D-equilibrium-based

Abstract = {{In the present article, a high-order global-local theory with
   three-dimensional elasticity corrections is employed to trace the local
   and instantaneous variations of lateral deflections and stress
   components of sandwich plates with auxetic (negative Poisson ratio)
   cores under static and dynamic loads. Effects of the auxetecity of the
   core material on the natural frequencies are evaluated as well. The
   governing equations are extracted based on Hamilton's principle. The
   main novelties of the present research in comparison to the available
   literature and previous researches of the second author of the present
   paper are: (i) Presenting a higher-order global-local plate theory with
   a novel equilibrium-based three-dimensional elasticity corrections, (ii)
   Incorporation of the transverse flexibility of the core; a fact that is
   crucial when studying behaviors of thick or soft core sandwich plates,
   (iii) Frequency and dynamic behavior analyses (in addition to the
   traditional static analysis) of sandwich plates with soft cores by means
   of the presented accurate global-local theory, and (iv) Investigation of
   the negative Poisson ratio (auxeticity) effects of the core material on
   the static (stress) and dynamic responses and natural frequencies. All
   these items are accomplished here, for the first time. Since the
   transverse shear stresses are extracted based on the three-dimensional
   elasticity theory, in contract the traditional constitutive-based
   theories, the inter-laminar continuity condition of the transverse shear
   stresses is met. The verification results show that the presented finite
   element formulation leads to highly accurate results, even for thick or
   soft core sandwich plates. A comprehensive parametric study is
   accomplished to evaluate effects of the auxeticity of the core material
   and transverse compliance of the core on the resulting displacement and
   stress distributions, natural frequencies, and dynamic responses.
   Results reveal that auxeticity of the core material decreases the global
   and relative stresses and lateral deflections of the face sheets and the
   core compliance may lead to asynchronized movements of the face sheets
   and strengthen the local bending and extensions.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical behaviors of a series of two-dimensional (2-D) crystals
   X3M2 (X = S, Se; M = N, P, As) are explored through density functional
   theory (DFT) calculations. Two atomic structures exist for 2-D X3M2,
   namely alpha-heart and beta-heart, which exhibit different out-of-plane
   Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) phenomena. For alpha-heart structures, a
   general out-of-plane NPR exists under in-plane tension in the y
   direction, while for beta-heart type structures, a general NPR exists
   under in-plane tension in the x direction. Through DFT calculations, we
   revealed that a NPR is a general phenomenon for 2-D X3M2 with
   heart-shaped atomic structures, and the absolute value of the
   out-of-plane NPR for 2-D X3M2 is always one order of magnitude larger
   than other 2-D crystals reported before. At the same time, the in-plane
   NPR at certain angles around two in-plane principal axes also exists for
   2-D X3M2 except for S3P2 due to the special heart-shaped structure. The
   coexistence of out-of-plane and in-plane NPRs for 2-D crystals has not
   been reported before and these special three-dimensional (3-D) auxetic
   properties in 2-D crystals may enormously enrich research studies on
   novel mechanical, electrical and chemical behaviors of 2-D crystals.
   This discovery will extend the family of 2-D crystals with a NPR and
   also provide new insights for designing novel negative Poisson's ratio
   materials.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Data-driven models are rising as an auspicious method for the
   geometrical design of materials and structural systems. Nevertheless,
   existing data-driven models customarily address the optimization of
   structural designs rather than metamaterial designs. Metamaterials are
   emerging as promising materials exhibiting tailorable and unprecedented
   properties for a wide spectrum of applications. In this paper, we
   develop a deep learning (DL) model based on a convolutional neural
   network (CNN) that predicts optimal metamaterial designs. The developed
   DL model non-iteratively optimizes metamaterials for either maximizing
   the bulk modulus, maximizing the shear modulus, or minimizing the
   Poisson's ratio (including negative values). The data are generated by
   solving a large set of inverse homogenization boundary values problems,
   with randomly generated geometrical features from a specific
   distribution. Such s data-driven model can play a vital role in
   accelerating more computationally expensive design problems, such as
   multiscale metamaterial systems. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {{Recently, although advances were made on modeling multivariate count
   data, existing models really has several limitations: (i) The
   multivariate Poisson log-normal model (Aitchison and Ho, 1989) cannot be
   used to fit multivariate count data with excess zero-vectors; (ii) The
   multivariate zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) distribution (Li et al., 1999)
   cannot be used to model zero-truncated/deflated count data and it is
   difficult to apply to high-dimensional cases; (iii) The Type I
   multivariate zero-adjusted Poisson (ZAP) distribution (Tian et al.,
   2017) could only model multivariate count data with a special
   correlation structure for random components that are all positive or
   negative. In this paper, we first introduce a new multivariate ZAP
   distribution, based on a multivariate Poisson distribution, which allows
   the correlations between components with a more flexible dependency
   structure, that is some of the correlation coefficients could be
   positive while others could be negative. We then develop its important
   distributional properties, and provide efficient statistical inference
   methods for multivariate ZAP model with or without covariates. Two real
   data examples in biomedicine are used to illustrate the proposed
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, highly porous fibre networks made of 316L fibres,
   with different fibre volume fractions, are characterized in terms of
   network architecture, elastic constants and fracture energies. Elastic
   constants are measured using quasi-static mechanical and modal vibration
   testing, yielding local and globally averaged properties, respectively.
   Differences between quasi-static and dynamic elastic constants are
   attributed to through-thickness shear effects. Regardless of the method
   employed, networks show signs of material inhomogeneity at high fibre
   densities, in agreement with X-ray nanotomography results. Strong
   auxetic (or negative Poisson's ratio) behaviour is observed in the
   through-thickness direction, which is attributed to fibre kinking
   induced during processing. Measured fracture energies are compared with
   model predictions incorporating information about in-plane fibre
   orientation distribution, fibre volume fraction and single fibre work of
   fracture. Experimental values are broadly consistent with model
   predictions, based on the assumption that this energy is primarily
   associated with plastic deformation of individual fibres within a
   process zone of the same order as the inter-joint spacing. (C) 2013 Acta

Abstract = {{Electrically-mediated actuation schemes offer great promise beyond
   popular pneumatic and suction based ones in soft robotics. However, they
   often rely on bespoke materials and manufacturing approaches that
   constrain design flexibility and widespread adoption. Following the
   recent introduction of a class of architected materials called handed
   shearing auxetics (HSAs), we present a 3D printing method for rapidly
   fabricating HSAs and HSA-based soft robots that can be directly driven
   by servo motors. To date, HSA fabrication has been limited to the laser
   cutting of extruded teflon tubes. Our work expands the HSA materials
   palette to include flexible and elastomeric polyurethanes. Herein, we
   investigate the influence of material composition and geometry on
   printed HSAs' mechanical behavior. In addition to individual HSA
   performance, we evaluate printed HSAs in two soft robotic systems - four
   degree-of-freedom (DoF) platforms and soft grippers - to confirm that
   printed HSAs perform similarly to the original teflon HSA designs.
   Finally, we demonstrate new soft robotic capabilities with 3D printed
   HSAs, including fully 3D printed HSA fingers, higher force generation in
   multi-DoF devices, and demonstrations of soft grippers with internal HSA
   endoskeletons. We anticipate our methods will expedite the design and
   integration of novel HSAs in electrically-driven soft robots and
   facilitate broader adoption of HSAs in the field.}},

Journal = {{TECHNOMETRICS}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression is a model for count data with
   excess zeros. It assumes that with probability p the only possible
   observation is 0, and with probability 1 - p, a Poisson(lambda) random
   variable is observed. For example, when manufacturing equipment is
   properly aligned, defects may be nearly impossible. But when it is
   misaligned, defects may occur according to a Poisson(lambda)
   distribution. Both the probability p of the perfect, zero defect state
   and the mean number of defects-lambda in the imperfect state-may depend
   on covariates. Sometimes p and lambda are unrelated; other times p is a
   simple function of lambda such as p = 1/(1 + lambda(tau)) for an unknown
   constant-tau. In either case, ZIP regression models are easy to fit. The
   maximum likelihood estimates (MLE's) are approximately normal in large
   samples, and confidence intervals can be constructed by inverting
   likelihood ratio tests or using the approximate normality of the MLE's.
   Simulations suggest that the confidence intervals based on likelihood
   ratio tests are better, however. Finally, ZIP regression models are not
   only easy to interpret, but they can also lead to more refined data
   analyses. For example, in an experiment concerning soldering defects on
   printed wiring boards, two sets of conditions gave about the same mean
   number of defects, but the perfect state was more likely under one set
   of conditions and the mean number of defects in the imperfect state was
   smaller under the other set of conditions; that is, ZIP regression can
   show not only which conditions give lower mean number of defects but
   also why the means are lower.}},

Title = {{Experimental approximation of the sound absorption coefficient

   lactic acid reinforced with chicken keratin materials}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{283}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In this research, auxetic composites of polylactic acid (PLA) reinforced
   by keratin materials (barbs and rachis), were developed through 3D
   printing manufacture to induce diverse acoustic properties. To evaluate
   the coefficient of sound absorption, an electro-acoustic experiment was
   implemented. The capacity of sound absorption for the composites was
   superior to conventional (honeycomb) and auxetic PLA geometries without
   reinforcement. Reduction of the free space in cavities (achieved by
   keratin materials) triggered an increment in the resistance in air flow,
   improving the sound absorption. Also, increasing the interconnectivity
   of the cavities provides sound waves with irregular transmission routes,
   which reduce the wave's energy. Thus, in this work, acoustic properties
   are associated with 3D geometry of auxetic composites, shape, and
   concentration of reinforcements; considering the synergistic effect due
   to this combination, a range of metamaterials with acoustic capabilities
   were generated. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We evaluated the relation between overweight and calcium
   intake in adults living in the municipality of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional population-based Study on a sample

   intake was measured by the 24-h recall method. Poisson's and linear
   regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relation between
   overweight and quartiles of calcium intake adjusted for energy.
   Results: The prevalence of overweight was 43.1\% and the average
   adjusted calcium intake was 448.6 mg. In the linear regression.
   analyses, the regression coefficient for adjusted calcium was
   significant and negative (P = 0.019, beta(1) = -0.0001). Although
   evaluated by quartiles, the prevalence ratio for overweight in the first
   quartile of calcium intake was 1.24 (95\% confidence interval 1.00-1.54)
   and that in the second quartile was 1.24 (95\% confidence interval

   Textiles from Hierarchical Assemblies}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Multifunctional textiles with programmable, multi-axial, distributed,
   and scalable actuation are highly desirable and presently unrealized. 1D
   torque-unbalanced active yarns within 2D textile structures are
   exploited to produce soft and scalable active textiles that exhibit
   tunable displacements, forces, stiffnesses, and kinematic deformations.
   Through a textile hierarchy spanning active material composition, yarn
   construction, textile geometry, and system architecture, these active
   textiles accomplish kinetic tunability, variable recruitment behaviors,
   and auxetic effects without mechanical contact, called active auxetic
   effects. New modes of pre-programmed multi-axial performance are enabled
   by geometrically manipulating-specifically pre-stressing and
   constraining-active filaments in torsion and leveraging their structural
   elastic instability within a textile geometry. The new kinematic motion
   afforded by torque-unbalanced active yarns enhances the performance of
   active textiles, which accomplish tensile strokes over 40\%, generated
   blocked forces up to 308 N m(-1), and specific work over 0.4. kJ kg(-1).
   Advances in active textiles are demonstrated through multifunctional 3D
   applications, including a variable constriction pump that exhibits
   sequential actuation, a wearable that conforms multi-axially around the
   body, and a soft exoskeleton that performs assistive motions and on-body
   anchoring simultaneously. By harnessing the capabilities of active
   materials within a textile hierarchy, advances in the potentiality of
   multifunctional textiles are presented.}},

Title = {{Study on the strain-induced mechanical property modulations in monolayer
   Tellurene}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional monolayer Tellurium, termed as Tellurene (Te), has
   recently been fabricated in the experiment. In this work, under uniaxial
   strain applied along either the armchair or zigzag direction with strain
   strength varying from 0 to 40\%, we have investigated the mechanical
   property of Te including three allotropes (alpha-Te, beta-Te, and
   gamma-Te). Our results show that the beta-Te exhibits the most obvious
   anisotropy in the stress-strain curve, Young's modulus, and Poisson's
   ratio, which is thought to originate from its inherent structure
   characteristic. The stress-strain curve demonstrates that the beta-Te
   can withstand relatively high critical strain up to 36\% in the armchair
   direction and 35\% in the zigzag direction. The calculated Young's
   modulus E(theta) of the beta-Te is 55 GPa in the zigzag direction and
   that is 27 GPa in the armchair direction. The comparative high critical
   strain and small Young's modulus mean that beta-Te has good flexibility.
   Moreover, under the strain range within 15\%, the direction being easy
   to be stretched has a reversion, which is thought to be decided by the
   competition between the puckered structure and the transfer charge
   resistant to deformation. Furthermore, when the strain is applied along
   the direction parallel to the pucker of beta-Te, it is interesting to
   find that Poisson's ratio is negative in the out-of-plane direction. The
   hinged structure of the beta-Te contributes to the negative Poisson's
   ratio, which can be comprehended by the hypothetical step-by-step
   evolution process. Published under license by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Various seismic attributes of gas hydrate bearing sediments were
   analyzed in the accretionary prism offshore of southwestern Taiwan
   utilizing seismic imaging, velocity analysis, AVO analysis, and AVO
   inversion of large offset seismic data. A bottom-simulating reflector
   (BSR) is clearly observed on the seismic section with a reversed
   polarity compared to that of the seabed reflection. Instantaneous
   amplitude sectioning clearly shows lateral variations of the BSR. The
   zero-phase waveform of the BSR is distinct and the weak reflectors above
   the BSR can be observed on the instantaneous phase section. AVO analysis
   shows the absolute value of the negative BSR amplitude increasing with
   offset. A low P-wave interval velocity layer was found below the strong
   BSR by detailed velocity analysis. Both the P (normal incident P-wave
   reflection coefficient) and G (AVO gradient) values are highly negative
   for the strong BSR on the P and G sections, and they lie in the third
   quadrant of the P and G cross-plot section. The P+G (reflectivity of
   Poisson's ratio) value is also negative on the P+G section and the P-G
   (normal incident S-wave reflection coefficient) value is approximately
   zero on the P-G section along the same strong BSR. All the seismic
   characters described above suggest that a gas hydrate layer exists
   together with a free gas layer below it along strong BSRs in the area
   offshore southwestern Taiwan.}},

Abstract = {{A heterogeneous material with a certain periodic microstructure may have

   expansion coefficients, which can satisfy some requirement of high
   technology. However, currently research about how to fabricate such 3-D
   periodic microstructures is rarely reported in the published literature
   and only some 2D fabrication procedures were developed. To fabricate
   such components, a hybrid-layered manufacturing process has been
   developed and applies spraying, engraving, and refinishing technologies,
   among which the engraving is the key technology for generating the voids
   of periodic microstructures with their required dimensions and
   accuracies. To implement such an accurate engraving, it is important to
   study its engraving behavior. This paper establishes a behavior model of
   the engraving operation and performs its behavior simulation, thus
   providing a reliable basis for future practical manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{Aim of this work is the synthesis of auxetic structures using a topology
   optimization approach for micropolar (or Cosserat) materials. A
   distributed compliant mechanism design problem is formulated, adopting a
   SIMP-like model to approximate the constitutive parameters of 2D
   micropolar bodies. The robustness of the proposed approach is assessed
   through numerical examples concerning the optimal design of structures
   that can expand perpendicularly to an applied tensile stress. The
   influence of the material characteristic length on the optimal layouts
   is investigated. Depending on the inherent flexural stiffness of
   micropolar solids, truss-like solutions typical of Cauchy solids are
   replaced by curved beam-like material distributions. No homogenization
   technique is implemented, since the proposed design approach applies to
   elements made of microstructured material with prescribed properties and
   not to the material itself.}},

Title = {{Cyclic tensile stimulation enrichment of Schwann cell-laden auxetic
   hydrogel scaffolds towards peripheral nerve tissue engineering}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The nervous system in the body is a complex network of nerves and cells
   that regulates several functions. Neural regeneration is a complex
   process that involves matrix secretion and remodeling, in which growth
   factors play a huge role in regulating such processes. Recent studies
   demonstrated the structures and topography of scaffolds are expected to
   provide a spectrum of unique biomimetic 3D microenvironments to regulate
   cell behavior. In this study, we fabricated auxetic scaffolds using fish
   gelatin methacrylamide and evaluated the effects of cyclic tensile
   stimulation effects on the neural differentiation capabilities of human
   Schwann cells. The auxetic hydrogels were found to withstand up to 20\%
   tensile strain without tears, and the hydrogels had lost only about 10\%
   weight after immersed for 14 days. The tensile forces were able to
   enhance cell viability and proliferation as compared to a static
   culture. In addition, the secretion of neural regeneration-related
   proteins was enhanced in the tensile stimulation group. The cell-laden
   auxetic scaffold with tensile stimulation caused improvement in the
   nerve growth factor and TRKA receptor expression. This is the first
   study to combine tensile stimulation with NGF. The initial results
   showed the positive potential of such conditions being applied in
   clinical applications. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The principal stress distributions in thick-wall cylinders due to
   variation in the Poisson's ratio are predicted using analytical and
   finite element methods. Analyses of appropriate brittle and ductile
   failure criteria show that under the isochoric pressure conditions
   investigated that auextic (i.e. those possessing a negative Poisson's
   ratio) materials act as stress concentrators; hence they are predicted
   to fail before their conventional (i.e. possessing a positive Poisson's
   ratio) material counterparts. The key finding of the work presented
   shows that for constrained thick-wall cylinders the maximum tensile
   principal stress can vanish at a particular Poisson's ratio and aspect
   ratio. This phenomenon is exploited in order to present an optimized
   design criterion for thick-wall cylinders. Moreover, via the use of a
   cogent finite element model, this criterion is also shown to be
   applicable for the design of micro-porous materials. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{215-225}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The work describes a structural composite damper concept based on a
   chiral auxetic configuration. Chiral structures couple uniaxial and
   rotational deformations to provide a negative Poisson's ratio behaviour
   and high dissipation through shear strain energy, and this feature is
   exploited by up-scaling the deformation mechanism of the chiral cell to
   design a damper that dissipates energy in the edgewise/shear modes, like
   the ones occurring in wind turbine blades. The damper concept and its
   configuration are evaluated through a series of Finite Element
   parametric and probabilistic models. A small-scale demonstrator is
   manufactured and subjected to compressive cyclic loading at increasing
   maximum displacements. Good agreement between the numerical and
   experimental force displacement and energy dissipated-displacement
   curves is observed, showing the feasibility of the chiral composite
   damper concept for vibration damping-related applications at low
   frequencies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The distinguishing structural feature of single-layered black phosphorus
   is its puckered structure, which leads to many novel physical
   properties. In this work, we first present a new parameterization of the
   Stillinger-Weber potential for single-layered black phosphorus. In doing
   so, we reveal the importance of a cross-pucker interaction term in
   capturing its unique mechanical properties, such as a negative Poisson's
   ratio. In particular, we show that the cross-pucker interaction enables
   the pucker to act as a re-entrant hinge, which expands in the lateral
   direction when it is stretched in the longitudinal direction. As a
   consequence, single-layered black phosphorus has a negative Poisson's
   ratio in the direction perpendicular to the atomic plane. As an
   additional demonstration of the impact of the cross-pucker interaction,
   we show that it is also the key factor that enables capturing the edge
   stress-induced bending of single-layered black phosphorus that has been
   reported in ab initio calculations.}},

   effective ionisation coefficient and electron generation rate. Each of
   them increases with the rise in relative humidity (RH). The particles
   densities of electrons, positive ions and negative ions when RH is 50,

Abstract = {{The first auxetic fibre was successfully produced in polypropylene using
   a novel melt-spinning route. These fibres were extruded at 159 degrees C
   with a screw speed 10 rpm (1.05 rad s(-1)) and 2 mpm (0.03 in s(-1))
   take-up speed. Characterisation of these fibres involved optical
   techniques (videoextensometry) to measure the strains along both the
   length and the width simultaneously during deformation. The unique
   processing route has now been developed to expand the range of auxetic
   extruded polymeric products. We report here that auxetic polypropylene
   films have been developed, and auxetic polyester and polyamide fibres
   have now been produced. We also report the development of a simple rough
   particle model to predict auxetic behaviour that may be applicable to
   the developed fibres and films. Finally, a review of some potential
   applications for auxetic fibres and films will be presented. These
   include as reinforcements in composites, anchoring devices, smart
   bandages for health-care, breathable packaging and tear resistant films.

Abstract = {{Periodic cellular configurations with negative Poisson's ratio have
   attracted the attention of several researchers because of their superior
   dynamic characteristics. Among the geometries featuring a negative
   Poisson's ratio, the chiral topology possesses a geometric complexity
   that guarantees unique deformed configurations when excited at one of
   its natural frequencies. Specifically, localized deformations have been
   observed even at relatively low excitation frequencies. This is of
   particular importance as resonance can be exploited to minimize the
   power required for the appearance of localized deformations, thus giving
   practicality to the concept. The particular nature of these deformed
   configurations and the authority provided by the chiral geometry,
   suggest the application of the proposed structural configuration for the
   design of innovative lifting bodies, such as helicopter rotor blades or
   airplane wings. The dynamic characteristics of chiral structures are
   here investigated through a numerical model and experimental
   investigations. The numerical formulation uses dynamic shape functions
   to accurately describe the behavior of the considered structural
   assembly over a wide frequency range. The model is used to predict
   frequency response functions, and to investigate the occurrence of
   localized deformations. Experimental tests are also performed to
   demonstrate the accuracy of the model and to illustrate the
   peculiarities of the behavior of the considered chiral structures.}},

Abstract = {{Needlepunched nonwovens represent a special class of three-dimensional
   (3D) fiber networks that successfully generated a host of applications
   but the rationale of their design involving the intricate microstructure
   and understanding of the mechanics of the relevant deformation is still

   materials possessing out-of-plane auxetic characteristics has been
   investigated by unraveling the anisotropic structure. The evolution of
   the 3D intricate architecture of anisotropic nonwoven materials under
   prescribed levels of tensile strain has been determined using a 3D
   optical profiler. Most importantly, the analytical models expressed in
   terms of the initial modulus and in-plane Poisson's ratio of the
   nonwoven materials are presented. A comparison between the theory and
   experiments revealed a satisfactory agreement for the modulus and
   in-plane Poisson's ratio. Further, a comparative analysis of well-known
   analytical models of in-plane Poisson's ratio with the experimental data
   clearly demonstrated that the plausible mechanism of deformation of

Title = {{A micromorphic computational homogenization framework for auxetic
   tetra-chiral structures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{135}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic chiral structures exhibit many unique and enhanced mechanical
   properties, which emerge from the coupling of stretching and rotational
   mechanisms within the underlying unit cell. The standard first-order
   Computational Homogenization (CH) approach is inadequate in capturing
   this coupling effect. Moreover, a size effect arising from the
   interactions between micro and macro length scales cannot be accounted
   for. In this contribution, the micromorphic CH framework developed in
   Biswas and Poh (2017), Biswas et al. (2019), is reformulated for 2D
   tetra-chiral solids to address these limitations. Together with the
   standard macro-distortion tensor, an additional kinematic variable is
   introduced to characterize the deformation and rotation of the central
   ring. These two kinematic fields, each characterizing a particular
   aspect of the unit cell deformation, enable the micromorphic framework
   to adequately characterize the underlying dominant deformation modes.
   The predictive capability of the micromorphic CH framework is
   demonstrated through three benchmark problems in plane strain condition.
   Considering an axial loading problem, it is shown that the proposed
   micromorphic framework accurately captures the coupling between internal
   ring rotation and stretching of tangential ligaments. The predictive
   capability of the micromorphic approach is next demonstrated with a flat
   punch indentation problem in a regime without a clear separation of
   length scales. The homogenized micromorphic model predicts the correct
   global force-displacement response, as well as the underlying
   deformation mechanisms. Finally, the capability of the micromorphic
   framework in capturing both distortional and rotational modes of the
   central ring is demonstrated through the axial loading of a tapering
   plate. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{New AVO expression and attribute based on scaled Poisson reflectivity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{185}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A new expression for Amplitude Variation with Offset (AVO) is proposed.
   The expression introduces reflection amplitudes as a function of two
   very common AVO parameters, the Gradient (G) and scaled Poisson
   reflectivity (SPR). The SPR is proven to be an excellent indicator of
   hydrocarbon with more sensitivity to fluid than other ordinary AVO
   attributes. Another advantage of the SPR is that it works for all types
   of gas-saturated sands commonly targeted by AVO. From the new
   expression, a new AVO classification based on SPR is introduced. The
   classification involves two classes: 1) Class H, with negative SPR and
   negative G, represents rocks with high probability of hydrocarbon
   presence, and 2) Class N, with nearly zero or positive G and SPR,
   includes rocks with high probability of no-hydrocarbon presence. An AVO
   attribute combining SPR and Gradient is derived from the expression and
   is proposed as a good indicator of fluid presence. The approximation and
   the attribute are applied on Marmousi-2 model datasets and on a field
   data from Alberta, Canada. The attribute has demonstrated a good
   identification of the hydrocarbon-saturated reservoirs in theoretical
   model and the real field data. The new AVO approximation, classification
   and attribute are intended to complement other existing approximations
   and reduce uncertainty from their interpretations. (C) 2021 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Following the successful batch production of auxetic ultra high
   molecular weight polyethylene, polypropylene and nylon, in the form of
   10 mm diameter cylinders, a continuous melt extrusion route was adapted
   from conventional melt extrusion routes to produce fibres. Previous
   studies have shown that, once drawing has occurred, the auxetic effect
   is lost and, consequently, the mechanical properties of these fibres
   have been restricting their otherwise great potential in a wide range of
   applications. Research has therefore been undertaken into improving this
   matter by subjecting the auxetic fibres to a range of different thermal
   post-production processing conditions. The fibres then underwent
   mechanical testing, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Video
   Extensometry. Results suggest that annealing enhances the mechanical
   properties of these fibres and may provide a further route to enhancing
   auxeticity in improving homogeneity by over 40\%.}},

   Benchmarking shows that the interpretation of SERE is unambiguous

   differences among bins (exons or genes), a score of 1 indicating
   faithful replication (i.e., samples are affected only by Poisson
   variation of individual counts), a score of 0 indicating data
   duplication, and scores > 1 corresponding to true global differences
   between RNA-Seq libraries. On the contrary the interpretation of
   Pearson's r is generally ambiguous and highly dependent on sequencing
   depth and the range of expression levels inherent to the sample
   (difference between lowest and highest bin count). Cohen's simple Kappa
   results are also ambiguous and are highly dependent on the choice of
   bins. For quantifying global sample differences SERE performs similarly
   to a measure based on the negative binomial distribution yet is simpler
   to compute.
   Conclusions: SERE can therefore serve as a straightforward and reliable
   statistical procedure for the global assessment of pairs or large groups
   of RNA-Seq datasets by a single statistical parameter.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an auxetic cellular structure consisting of re-entrant
   hexagonal cells have been analyzed, exhibiting different elastic
   properties in two orthogonal directions. A novel strain-based expansion
   homogenization method has been proposed and used to contrastively
   analyze the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the re-entrant
   auxetic cellular structure in two principal directions. The comparison
   of the obtained theoretical results with the simulation results and the
   experimental results shows good agreement, which validates the
   effectiveness of the analytical model. With the validated model, the
   dependence of the elastic properties on the geometric parameters of the
   unit cell, including the aspect ratio, length ratio and re-entrant
   angle, has been further investigated. The results also indicate that the
   analyzed auxetic structure features a stiffer modulus along the
   re-entrant direction especially for a small re-entrant angle. Moreover,
   the auxetic structure shows a stronger auxeticity along the re-entrant
   direction when the re-entrant angle is smaller than the transitional
   point. A design map has been presented to show the great potential of
   the structure in function-oriented design, providing an extensive
   reference for the practical engineering application. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Two dimensional materials have been regarded as promising candidates for
   photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we systematically investigated
   the potential of a novel two dimensional penta-X2C (X = P, As, Sb)
   family for photocatalytic water splitting by means of density functional
   theory. The penta-X2C family consists of semiconductors with indirect
   band gaps of 2.64 eV, 2.09 eV and 1.35 eV for X = P, As and Sb,
   respectively. Notably, the band edge positions of penta-P2C and
   penta-As2C can perfectly satisfy the redox potentials of photocatalytic
   water splitting via strain engineering, whereas penta-Sb2C only meets
   the reduction potential. The ultrahigh (up to 10(3)-10(5) cm(2) V-1
   s(-1)) and anisotropic carrier mobilities are crucial to suppressing the
   photogenerated electron-hole pair recombination. Meanwhile, the
   penta-X2C family exhibits excellent light absorption in the
   visible-ultraviolet region, favorable for the utilization of sunlight.
   In addition, compared with other common 2D materials such as graphene
   and h-BN, the penta-X2C family possesses a relatively smaller Young's
   modulus and larger critical strain, while penta-X2C have large negative
   Poisson's ratios of -0.103, -0.079 and -0.077, respectively. These
   results testify that the penta-X2C family has potential applications not
   only in photocatalytic water splitting but also in designing 2D
   electromechanical and optoelectronic devices.}},

Title = {{Application of detecting and taking overdispersion into account in
   Poisson regression model}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background. - Researchers often use the Poisson regression model to
   analyze count data. Overdispersion can occur when a Poisson regression
   model is used, resulting in an underestimation of variance of the
   regression model parameters. Our objective was to take overdispersion
   into account and assess its impact with an illustration based on the
   data of a study investigating the relationship between use of the
   Internet to seek health information and number of primary care
   consultations.
   Methods. - Three methods, overdispersed Poisson, a robust estimator, and
   negative binomial regression, were performed to take overdispersion into
   account in explaining variation in the number (Y) of primary care
   consultations. We tested overdispersion in the Poisson regression model
   using the ratio of the sum of Pearson residuals over the number of
   degrees of freedom (chi(2)/df). We then fitted the three models and
   compared parameter estimation to the estimations given by Poisson
   regression model.
   Results. - Variance of the number of primary care consultations
   (Var{[}Y] = 21.03) was greater than the mean (E{[}Y] = 5.93) and the
   chi(2)/df ratio was 3.26, which confirmed overdispersion. Standard
   errors of the parameters varied greatly between the Poisson regression
   model and the three other regression models. Interpretation of estimates
   from two variables (using the Internet to seek health information and
   single parent family) would have changed according to the model
   retained, with significant levels of 0.06 and 0.002 (Poisson), 0.29 and
   0.09 (overdispersed Poisson), 0.29 and 0.13 (use of a robust estimator)
   and 0.45 and 0.13 (negative binomial) respectively.
   Conclusion. - Different methods exist to solve the problem of
   underestimating variance in the Poisson regression model when
   overdispersion is present. The negative binomial regression model seems
   to be particularly accurate because of its theorical distribution; in
   addition this regression is easy to perform with ordinary statistical
   software packages. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the interrelationship of elastic and piezoelectric properties
   with the lattice structure and crystal physics of paratellurite
   (alpha-TeO2). Tetragonal paratellurite (D-4(4),P422) shows six
   independent elastic constants C-ijkl, the associated internal friction
   Q(ijkl)(-1), and one piezoelectric coefficient e(14). We determined
   simultaneously these material coefficients using resonant ultrasound
   spectroscopy coupled with laser-Doppler interferometry. Mode
   identification, essential for success, was done by measuring the
   displacement distributions on a vibrating-specimen surface. Our C-ijkl
   were consistent with reported values measured by conventional methods.
   Our e(14) exceeds the reported value by 53\%. We focus on several
   unusual elastic properties, including a negative Poisson ratio.
   Considering a star-shape truss structure on the basal plane consistently
   explains all of them. Internal friction correlates with the C-ijkl
   temperature derivatives, suggesting phonon-phonon interactions as a
   dominant cause of the mechanical loss.}},

Abstract = {{We constructed a new class of three-dimensional cellular metamaterials

   topology using oblique load-bearing ligaments. As the planar structure
   is subjected to loading, the circular elements rotate and the ligaments
   undergo bending, resulting in out-of-plane deformation of the
   three-dimensional cellularmetamaterials. The node design, and
   specifically the ligaments' revolution angle govern the behavior of
   cellular metamaterials. This was demonstrated by designing cellular
   metamaterials with a wide range of positive and negative Poisson's ratio

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of the anti-tetrachiral structure having the
   thickness of the ligament changing symmetrically around the center are
   investigated using analytical and numerical methods. For the purpose of
   deriving a theoretical model, the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is used to
   determine the relation among the acting moment, the angle of rotation of
   the nodes, and the bending energy stored. Analysis of the results
   indicates that a change in geometry has a minor effect on Poisson's
   ratio, if any at all; however, it can result in relatively large changes
   in Young's modulus. Hence, it is shown that the mechanical properties
   can be altered selectively by adjusting the geometric features of chiral
   structures. The indications of the analytical model are validated using
   numerical methods for different values of the geometric parameters and
   are found to be in good agreement. In the process, it is shown that
   there are regions of the parameter space where the mechanical properties
   of the anti-tetrachiral are insensitive to variations in certain
   geometric dimensions.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{42}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Taking doubly charged particles, positive-negative charge pair
   production and the effects of volume fluctuations into account, the
   Poisson baseline of the fluctuations of net-charge is studied. Within
   the Poisson baseline, the cumulants of net-charge are derived. Comparing
   to the Skellam baseline of net-charge, we infer that doubly charged
   particles broaden the distributions of net-charge, while
   positive-negative charge pairs narrow the distributions. Using the
   ratios of doubly charged particles and positive-negative charge pairs
   from neutral resonance decays to the total positive charges from
   THERMINATOR 2, the first four orders of moments and the corresponding
   moment products are calculated in the Poisson baseline for Au + Au
   collisions at root s(NN) = 200 GeV at RHIC/STAR. We find that the
   standard deviation is mainly influenced by the resonance decay, while
   the third and fourth order moments and corresponding moment products are
   mainly modified and fit the data of RHIC/STAR much better after
   including the effects of volume fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{A ferrogel model based on a polymer network with single-domain magnetic
   particles is constructed. The non-magnetic matrix is represented by a
   two-dimensional bead-spring model where beads interacting via
   Lennard-Jones potential are connected by harmonic springs. It is assumed
   that in each polymer chain of beads some bonds include magnetic grains.
   In the considered model, a conformation of polymer chains is analyzed in
   terms of bead positions and magnetic grains are introduced into the
   model via magnetic torque acting on the bond connecting neighboring
   beads. The magnetic torque is absent if the external magnetic field is
   set to zero. We examine the case when the polymer matrix under
   consideration exhibits unusual auxetic behavior, i.e., it expands under
   a stretching force applied to the ends of the chain. The analysis of the
   ferrogel model presented in this paper is a result of molecular
   simulations in which the motion of grain magnetization is described by
   the Landau-Lifshits-Gilbert equation.}},

   Effect of spin-orbit coupling}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Using first-principles calculations, we systematically study the elastic
   stiffness constants, mechanical properties, elastic wave velocities,
   Debye temperature, melting temperature, and specific heat of several
   thermodynamically stable crystal structures of BixSb1-x (0 < x < 1)
   binaries, which are of great interest due to their numerous inherent
   rich properties, such as thermoelectricity, thermomagnetic cooling,
   strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects, and topological features in
   the electronic band structure. We analyze the bulk modulus (B), Young's
   modulus (E), shear modulus (G), B/G ratio, and Poisson's ratio (nu) as a
   function of the Bi concentration in BixSb1-x. The effect of SOC on the
   above-mentioned properties is further investigated. In general, we
   observe that the SOC effects cause elastic softening in most of the
   studied structures. Three monoclinic structures of Bi-Sb binaries are
   found to exhibit significantly large auxetic behavior due to the
   hingelike geometric structure of bonds. The Debye temperature and the
   magnitude of the elastic wave velocities monotonically increase with
   increasing Sb concentration. However, anomalies were observed at very
   low Sb concentration. We also discuss the specific-heat capacity versus
   temperature data for all studied binaries. Our theoretical results are
   in excellent agreement with the existing experimental and theoretical
   data. The comprehensive understanding of the material properties such as
   hardness, mechanical strength, melting temperature, propagation of the
   elastic waves, auxeticity, and heat capacity is vital for practical
   applications of the studied binaries.}},

Abstract = {{This paper extends the univariate zero-and-one inflated Poisson (ZOIP)
   distribution (Melkersson \& Olsson, 1999; Zhang et al., 2016) to its
   multivariate version, which can be used to model correlated multivariate

   importantly, this new multivariate ZOIP distribution possesses a
   flexible dependency structure: i.e., the correlation coefficient between
   any two random components could be either positive or negative depending
   on the values of the parameters. The important distributional properties
   are explored and some useful statistical inference methods without and
   with covariates are developed. Simulation studies are conducted to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. Finally, two real data

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The structural and mechanical properties of the deltic, squaric and
   croconic cyclic oxocarbon acids were obtained using theoretical
   solid-state methods based in Density Functional Theory employing very
   demanding calculation parameters in order to yield realistic theoretical
   descriptions of these materials. The computed lattice parameters, bond
   distances, angles, and x-ray powder diffraction patterns of these
   materials were in excellent agreement with their experimental
   counterparts. The crystal structures of these materials were found to be
   mechanically stable since the calculated stiffness tensors satisfy the
   Born mechanical stability conditions. Furthermore, the values of the
   bulk modulus and their pressure derivatives, shear and Young moduli,
   Poisson ratio, ductility and hardness indices, as well as mechanical
   anisotropy measures of these materials were reported. A complete review
   of the literature concerning the negative Poisson ratio and negative
   linear compressibility phenomena is given together with the theoretical
   study of the mechanical behavior of cyclic oxocarbon acid materials. The
   deltic, squaric, and croconic acids in the solid state are highly
   anisotropic materials characterized by low hardness and relatively low
   bulk moduli. The three materials display small negative Poisson ratios.
   The croconic acid displays the phenomenon of negative linear
   compressibility for applied pressures larger than similar to 0.4 GPa
   directed along the direction of minimum Poisson ratio and undergoes a
   pressure induced phase transition at applied pressures larger than
   similar to 1.0 GPa.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effects of lattice stiffeners and blast load on
   nonlinear dynamic response and vibration of auxetic sandwich honeycomb
   plates on Pasternak elastic foundations are considered. The remarkable
   point of this study is that the outer surfaces of the system reinforced
   by lattice stiffeners (including orthogonal stiffeners and oblique
   stiffeners) are made of functionally graded materials. Based on the
   analytical solution, the Reddy's FSDT, the Airy's stress functions, the
   Galerkin and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta methods, fundamental
   frequency, dynamic response and frequency-amplitude curves of the plates
   reinforced by lattice stiffeners under blast and mechanical loads are
   determined. Then, the result analyses the effect of lattice stiffeners,
   blast and mechanical loads, elastic foundations on nonlinear dynamic
   response and vibration of auxetic honeycomb plates. The optimal angle of
   oblique stiffeners which maximizes natural frequency and
   contemporaneously minimizes amplitude when changing geometrical
   parameters of auxetic honeycomb is also determined.}},

Abstract = {{Compliant structures allow robots to overcome environmental challenges
   by deforming and conforming their bodies. In this paper, we investigate
   auxetic structures as a means of achieving this compliance for soft
   robots. Taking a tiling based approach, we fabricate 3D printed
   cylindrical auxetic structures to create tiled auxetic cylinders (TACs).
   We characterise the relative stiffness of the structures and show that
   variation in behaviour can be achieved by modifying the geometry within
   the same tiling family. In addition, we analysed the equivalent
   Poisson's ratio and found the range between the investigated designs to
   span from -0.33 to -2. Furthermore, we demonstrate a conceptual
   application in the design of a soft robot using the auxetic cylinders.
   We show that these structures can reactively change in shape, thereby
   reducing the complexity of control, with potential applications in
   confined spaces such as the human body, or for exploration through
   unpredictable terrain.}},

   solitary waves in an elastic rod of positive or negative Poisson's
   ratio, i.e. of a common or auxetic material. Splitting of various

   considered in frames of a model which contains both quadratic and cubic
   nonlinear terms. The obtained results are compared with some exact
   analytic solutions, called solitons, what leads to the conclusion that
   the solitons describe well the more complicated wave fields which are
   obtained by numerical simulations. This is because the analytic
   solutions reflect complete balance between various orders of
   nonlinearity and dispersion. Collisions between some obtained solitary
   waves are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{alpha-cristobalite is a metastable polymorph of silica which has the
   remarkable property of exhibiting a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic).
   In this study, the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of
   this system were investigated through a force-field based approach.
   Besides simulations on the actual structure of -cristobalite, a number
   of simulations where the rigidity of SiO2 tetrahedra was increased, were
   also conducted. This was done in order to obtain a clearer picture of
   the role which these tetrahedra play in determining the mechanical
   properties of this system. These systems were loaded in an off-axis
   direction in a number of planes about the {[}001] direction and the
   deformations observed were compared with those of type II rotating
   rectangle systems. It was discovered that the mechanical properties of
   -cristobalite can be accurately described through the semi-rigid version
   of this model, even for cases where the tetrahedra were fully rigid. (C)

Pages = {{95-105}},
Abstract = {{Honeycomb materials have been widely used as energy absorbers in
   structural impact protection and it can be tailored to shrink in the
   vicinity of impact zone, which contributes to better impact resistance.
   The chiral honeycomb is characterized by a non-intuitive negative
   in-plane Poisson's ratio (auxeticity), for the hexagonal chiral
   honeycomb, which exhibits a theoretic value of -1. However, the
   comprehensive study of the performance of chiral honeycomb under impact
   has not been studied to date. In this paper, firstly, the theoretical
   solution of yield stress for chiral honeycomb was obtained in terms of
   quasi-static loading. Thereafter, the in-plane dynamic crushing and
   energy-absorption capabilities of chiral honeycomb were studied
   numerically by means of finite element (FE) method. A comparative study
   between the chiral honeycomb and conventional hexagonal honeycomb was
   also performed to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the two
   materials. In addition, a parametric study was conducted to investigate
   the effects of geometric topologies and impact scenarios on the response
   of chiral honeycomb. The numerical results show that the performance of
   plastic energy dissipation of chiral honeycomb is dependent not only on
   structural parameters but also on crushing velocities. The present study
   is committed to providing an important reference to the application of
   chiral honeycomb in the crashworthiness design.}},

Abstract = {{Systems of model planar, nonconvex, hard-body ``molecules{''} of

   (seven) identical hard disks ``atoms{''} with centers forming regular
   pentagons (heptagons) of sides equal to the disk diameter. The elastic

   Results obtained by using pseudorandom number generators based on the
   idea proposed by Holian and co-workers {[}Holian , Phys. Rev. E 50, 1607

   is shown that singular behavior of the elastic constants near close
   packing is in agreement with the free volume approximation; the
   coefficients of the leading singularities are estimated. The simulations
   prove that the highest density structures of heptamers (in which the

Abstract = {{In this research contribution, the static behavior and failure
   mechanisms are developed for a three-dimensional (3D) printed dogbone,
   auxetic structure and sandwich composite using acoustic emissions (AEs).
   The skins, core and whole sandwich are manufactured using the same
   bio-based material which is polylactic acid reinforced with micro-flax
   fibers. Tensile tests are conducted on the skins and the core while
   bending tests are conducted on the sandwich composite. Those tests are
   carried out on four different auxetic densities in order to investigate
   their effect on the mechanical and damage properties of the materials.
   To monitor the invisible damage and damage propagation, a highly
   sensitive AE testing method is used. It is found that the sandwich with
   high core density displays advanced mechanical properties in terms of

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we design and test a parameter optimization method by
   Python script to meet the urgent demand for lightweight honeycomb
   metamaterial. The method mainly focuses on the selection of parameters
   according to the mass and Poisson's ratio of the honeycomb metamaterial.
   The bidirectional re-entrant honeycomb is proposed as an objective to be
   optimized and the formula of Poisson's ratio is deduced theoretically to
   establish the internal relation. Besides, the accuracy of the Python
   script results is verified by static compression experimental results
   and theoretical results. Combined the Python script programming model
   with the genetic algorithm optimization method, the optimal honeycomb
   metamaterial solutions are obtained. Results show that the parameter
   optimization method using multi-island genetic algorithm (GA) can avoid
   a local solution's appearance, and both the shell model and the solid
   model can obtain the ideal optimal solution. Furthermore, the 3D
   honeycomb has an admirable auxetic effect according to the optimized
   parameters, which provides a piece of strong evidence for the continuous
   application of optimization algorithms to improve the mechanical
   properties of honeycomb metamaterial.}},

Abstract = {{A discrete Lagrangian approach is the basis for modelling the macroscale
   elastic response of a solid material, which can be homogeneous as well
   as a periodic composite. The basic topology is a square ``heuristic
   molecule{''} that is an assemblage of four rigid bodies with a definite
   shape bonded by elastic springs. This is the minimum unit cell, UC, that
   contains all the macroscopic mechanical properties of the solid
   material, object of study. The paper presents 4 unit cells, in
   progression from a basic molecule bonded by 2 types of central forces,
   to a refined ``Cosserat-auxetic{''} molecule that is connected by 4
   types of shear and central bond-springs. The emphasis is given to the
   isotropic response in relation to the value of the macroscopic Poisson
   ratio, and the four examples of UC topologies are presented showing
   their relationship to different materials at the macro-scale: from a
   ``rari-constant{''} continuum, through a standard isotropic Cauchy
   continuum, up to an isotropic centre-symmetric auxetic Cosserat solid.

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Using density functional theory (DFT), a designed isoelectronic
   counterpart of phosphorene, black-phosphorusanalogous monolayer CSe
   (alpha-CSe) was confirmed to be stable. alpha-CSe displays apparently
   anisotropic behaviors of in-plane mechanics through calculating ideal
   tensile strength and critical strain, which thus causes anisotropic
   response to in-plane strains in its electronic and transport properties.
   It was found that the monolayer alpha-CSe can endure an ultimate stress
   of 4.008 N/m along armchair direction at epsilon(x) = 0.28, and 10.96
   N/m along zigzag direction at epsilon(y) = 0.22. Intriguingly, the
   strain praxis of alpha-CSe under zigzag deformation highlights a
   negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio of - 0.76 rooted in its puckered
   structure. Direct-to-indirect bandgap transitions and reverse
   transitions occurred alternatively under uniaxial and biaxial strains,
   which in essence issued in drastic variation of effective mass in
   k-place. Thus, the prior transport direction of carriers can be feasibly
   tuned by imposing biaxial strain. However, the preferred armchair
   transport direction is irrespective of strain size and present good
   mechanical stability, under the uniaxial strain. The anisotropic
   Dirac-like dispersions in alpha-CSe were identified at appropriate
   strain value, which unveiled the ballistic conduction along Gamma-Y. Our
   numerical results offered meritorious information of puckered sheets by
   insight into alpha-CSe, and revealed the prospects of alpha-CSe in
   nano-devices applications.}},

Title = {{Extension twist deformation response of an auxetic cylindrical structure
   inspired by deformed cell ligaments}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{238}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in artificial metamaterials have allowed unique
   structures to deform in distinct modes not previously found in
   traditional material form. Auxetic structures that induce twist through
   deformation have been a focus of recent research. In this paper a
   cell-based tubular structure with pre-deformed ligaments is proposed
   which exhibits efficient extension induced twist (EIT) without the
   limitations of buckling. An analytical model of the structure is
   proposed using cell parameters to characterize the non-linear
   twist-deformation relationship. Samples of the structure were fabricated
   using the Ultimaker 3 platform with elastomer based TPU 95a build
   material and PVA support material. The analytical model and FEM were
   validated by tensile experiments, where fabricated samples reached 60
   degrees of non-linear axial twist over 40 mm of deformation. In order to
   further characterize the structure's twist response, key design
   parameters of the lattice structure were varied and modelled. Actuation
   through tensile elastic deformation has key advantages in reliability
   and reduced complexity. Due to these advantages, this technology has
   potential applications in aerospace, biomedical and robotic fields.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{257}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{In the present study, a novel theoretical model is developed, based on
   classical laminate theory, to predict the equivalent mechanical
   properties of the re-entrant lattice structures, which composed of
   continuous fiber reinforced composite struts. Three main mechanism of
   stretching, flexing and hinging are considered and a general closed-form
   formulation is derived to estimate the auxetic honeycomb's elastic and
   shear modulus as well as Poisson's ratios. In spite of previous studies
   in which the response of honeycomb structures is modeled using beam
   theory, here, each strut of unit cell is expressed as a composite
   laminate with orthotropic mechanical properties and classical laminate
   theory is implemented to calculate the mechanical constants. In
   addition, using the available relations, the elastic buckling stress and
   failure load of the auxetic unit cell is evaluated. The proposed model
   is validated using experimental results, which are available from the
   previous studies as well as FE simulations. A parametric study is also
   conducted on the model to study the effects of cell angle and
   honeycomb's density on the mechanical properties and failure stresses of
   the re-entrant structure. The results show that, the proposed analytical
   model can finely predict the equivalent and failure properties of the
   auxetic honeycomb structures. Furthermore, it is observed that, for the
   considered re-entrant composite structures with the cell angles between
   -25 to 25, the vertical strut fails due to the damage evolution and for
   the unit cells with other cell angles, the buckling failure is
   determinative.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) has been
   fabricated by omitting the extrusion stage usually required to form the
   characteristic nodule-fibril microstructure of this material. This new
   route consists of compaction followed by multiple sintering treatments,
   with the best results using two successive sintering treatments. This
   article examines the mechanical properties of cylindrical compacts
   subjected to between one and four successive sintering treatments. The
   indentation resistance of the double-sintered material was found to be
   2.5 times that of conventionally processed UHMWPE and similar to that
   found in the extruded form of auxetic polyethylene. The flexural
   strength and strain to failure increase dramatically with the first
   sintering treatment and then remain almost constant. This processing
   route has potential for the production of more complex, useful shapes
   than can currently be produced since it removes the limitations imposed
   by the geometry of the barrel required for the extrusion stage.}},

Abstract = {{In many applications, we assume that two random observations x and y are
   generated according to independent Poisson distributions P(lambda S) and
   P(mu T) and we are interested in performing statistical inference on the
   ratio phi = lambda/mu of the two incidence rates. In vaccine efficacy
   trials, x and y are typically the numbers of cases in the vaccine and
   the control groups respectively, phi is called the relative risk and the
   statistical model is called `partial immunity model'. In this paper we
   start by defining a natural semi-conjugate family of prior distributions
   for this model, allowing straightforward computation of the posterior
   inference. Following theory on reference priors, we define the reference
   prior for the partial immunity model when phi is the parameter of
   interest. We also define a family of reference priors with partial
   information on mu while remaining uninformative about phi. We notice
   that these priors belong to the semi-conjugate family. We then
   demonstrate using numerical examples that Bayesian credible intervals
   for phi enjoy attractive frequentist properties when using reference
   priors, a typical property of reference priors.}},

Abstract = {{The work describes the manufacturing, mechanical properties, and wave
   propagation characteristics of a pyramidal lattice made exhibiting an
   auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) behavior. Contrary to similar lattice
   tessellations produced using metal cores, the pyramidal lattice
   described in this work is manufactured using a kirigami (origami plus
   cutting pattern) technique, which can be applied to a large variety of
   thermoset and thermoplastic composites. Due to the particular geometry
   created through this manufacturing technique, the kirigami pyramidal
   lattice shows an inversion between in-plane and out-of-plane mechanical
   properties compared to classical honeycomb configurations. Long
   wavelength approximations are used to calculate the slowness curves,
   showing unusual zero-curvature phononic properties in the transverse
   plane. A novel 2D wave propagation technique based on Bloch waves for
   damped structures is also applied to evaluate the dispersion behavior of
   composite (Kevlar/epoxy) lattices with intrinsic hysteretic loss. The 2D
   wave propagation analysis shows evanescence directivity at different
   frequency bandwidths and complex modal behavior due to unusual
   deformation mechanism of the lattice.}},

Abstract = {{A novel route for production of auxetic fibres has been adapted from
   conventional melt extrusion techniques. These fibres were reproduced,
   characterised and tested, for the first time, to assess the potential of
   auxetic fibres as reinforcements in composite materials. Initial
   experimental work has included the embedding of single fibres in
   modified epoxy resin. Auxetic fibre specimens were then compared with
   conventional fibre specimens through a specially designed fibre pullout
   testing procedure. The auxetic specimens displayed superior anchoring
   properties. The average maximum force at de-bonding of the auxetic
   fibres (0.95 N) was observed to be over 100\% higher than that for
   conventional ones (0.44 N) and the average energy required to fully
   extract the auxetic fibre from the modified resin was 8.3 mJ while the
   conventional fibre required only 2.5 mJ on average. The results indicate
   that composites employing auxetic fibres as the reinforcement phase will
   exhibit enhanced resistance to failure due to fibre pullout. (c) 2005

Volume = {{79}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The research determined the resistance to compression and low velocity
   impact of wood-based sandwich panels, the face sheet made of
   high-density fiber board, and high pressure laminate, while its auxetic
   lattice core was made by 3D printing using LayWood bio-composite
   filament. The core's auxetic property (i.e. exhibiting negative
   Poisson's ratio) was observed within the planes parallel to the facings.
   The ability of particular types of multilayer panels to absorb the
   energy was also determined. Based on the analysis of the obtained test
   results, it was proven that the core denoted as B, with inclination
   angle of the cell ribs phi(x) = phi(y) = 65 degrees, shows the highest
   compressive strength. It was determined that the dynamic load causes a
   very high overload in high-density fiber board face sheets. This results
   in damage to the sandwich panel surface and core structure. Cells of
   type B favorably minimize the differences in absorbed energy when using
   different face sheets and the energy value for low velocity impact.
   Taking into account the amount of absorbed energy, the most attractive
   is the panel with the D-type orthotropic core characterized by an
   inclination angle of the cell ribs phi(x) = 30 degrees, phi(y) = 60
   degrees. The amount of energy absorbed by samples with high-density
   fiberboard face sheets increases significantly depending on the
   impactor's energy. For panels with face sheets manufactured from
   high-pressure laminate, the amount of energy absorbed decreases.}},

Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Exploring the configurational space of specific origami patterns
   {[}e.g., Miura-ori (flat surface with parallelogram crease patterns),
   eggbox] has led to notable advances in science and technology. To
   augment the origami design space, we present a pattern, named
   ``Morph,{''} which combines the features of its parent patterns. We
   introduce a four-vertex origami cell that morphs continuously between a
   Miura mode and an eggbox mode, forming an homotopy class of
   configurations. This is achieved by changing the mountain and valley
   assignment of one of the creases, leading to a smooth switch through a
   wide range of negative and positive Poisson's ratios. We present elegant
   analytical expressions of Poisson's ratios for both in-plane stretching
   and out-of-plane bending and find that they are equal in magnitude and
   opposite in sign. Further, we show that by combining compatible unit
   cells in each of the aforementioned modes through kinematic bifurcation,
   we can create hybrid origami patterns that display unique properties,
   such as topological mode locking and tunable switching of Poisson's
   ratio.}},

   experiment was conducted during the 2010-2011 crop season in UNESP/FCAV,
   Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil, in two fields of 10,000-m(2) area that were
   subdivided into 100 plots (10 m x 10 m). The cultivars sown were M 7908
   RR and its isoline M-SOY 8001. The number of the first to fifth instars
   and the number of adults were determined. To evaluate insect dispersion
   in the area, the following indices were used: variance/mean ratio,
   Morisita index, Green coefficient, and the k exponent of the negative
   binomial distribution. To study probabilistic models to describe the
   spatial distribution of the insects, the adjustments of the Poisson and
   negative binomial distributions were tested. The first to third instars
   showed aggregated spatial distribution, whereas the fourth and fifth
   instars, and adults, isolated or grouped, showed variation in the
   arrangement, ranging from moderately aggregated to randomly dispersed.
   During the adjustment of probability distributions, the negative
   binomial distribution model showed adjustment for the first to third

Title = {{Enhancement of the vibro-acoustic performance of anti-tetra-chiral
   auxetic sandwich panels using topologically optimized local resonators}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{177}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on identifying parameters for optimized distributions
   of local internal resonators to enhance the vibro-acoustic performance
   of anti-tetra-chiral auxetic sandwich panels. The sandwich panel and its
   auxetic core are simulated using a full-scale finite element approach.
   An equivalent homogenized model is then employed to reduce the
   computational time of the optimization problem. The homogenized model is
   based on theoretical formulations and verified with the full-scale
   model. Clusters of resonators are added to the structure to act as local
   resonators. These resonators are parallel with the through-the-thickness
   direction of the panel and provide an Absorbing Tuned Auxiliary System
   (ATAS) to mitigate flexural vibrations over a frequency range. The
   mechanical parameters of the resonators and the geometrical topology are
   the design variables. The frequency-dependent radiated mean sound level
   (RMSL) and the maximum peak value of the Radiated Sound Power Level
   (RSPL) are two different objective functions for the optimization. The
   effects of the loading pattern, topology configuration and objective
   functions on the optimization results are investigated. The use of
   localized resonators in the anti-tetra chiral sandwich structures can
   enhance remarkably the sound attenuation of the panels, particularly in
   the case of local loading conditions. We observe 3.7 and 2.6 dB RMSL
   attenuations for the local and full coverage sound pressure loadings. In
   a similar fashion, 15.9 and 11.5 dB attenuation at RSPL peak are also
   observed in the auxetic panels for the two sound pressure loading
   conditions. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is the measure of the extent by which the lengthening of
   a rod induces its thinning and vice versa. Prismanes are the only
   molecular system that exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio (Auxetic
   effect). On the basis of the Thorpe-Ingold effect, which underlines the
   auxetic effect in prismanes, it is expected that silicon-based prismane
   will manifest a smaller Poisson's ratio than carbon-based prismanes and
   that fluorine substitution on the terminal rings will also diminish the
   effect. Stretching and compressing experiments show that indeed the
   auxetic effect is significantly reduced upon going from carbon to
   silicon and moreover that fluorine substitution reverts the behavior of
   silicon-based prismancs from showing a negative Poisson's ratio to a
   positive one. This is probably the first example of a
   substituent-induced reversal of the mechanical property of a chemical
   system.}},

Title = {{Vibration and Sound Transmission Performance of Sandwich Panels with
   Uniform and Gradient Auxetic Double Arrowhead Honeycomb Cores}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2019}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic mechanical metamaterials that exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) can be artificially designed to exhibit a unique range of physical
   and mechanical properties. Novel sandwich structures composed of uniform
   and gradient auxetic double arrowhead honeycomb (DAH) cores were
   investigated in terms of their vibration and sound transmission
   performance stimulated by nonhomogeneous metamaterials with nonperiodic
   cell geometries. The spectral element method (SEM) was employed to
   accurately evaluate the natural frequencies and dynamic responses with a
   limited number of elements at high frequencies. The results indicated
   that the vibrating mode shapes and deformations of the DAH sandwich
   models were strongly affected by the patterned gradient metamaterials.
   In addition, the sound insulation performance of the considered DAH
   sandwich models was investigated regarding the sound transmission loss
   (STL) from 1Hz to 1500Hz under a normal incident planar wave, and this
   performance was compared with that for hexagonal honeycomb sandwich
   panels. A programmable structural-acoustic optimization was implemented
   to maximize the STL while maintaining a constant weight and high
   strength. The results showed that the uniform DAH sandwich models with
   larger NPRs generally exhibited better vibration and acoustic
   attenuation behaviors and that the optimized gradient increasing NPR
   models yielded higher STL values than the optimized gradient decreasing
   NPR models for two specified frequency cases, with improvements of
   6.52dB and 2.52dB and a higher bending stiffness but a lower overall
   STL. Thus, sandwich panels consisting of auxetic DAHs can achieve
   desirable vibroacoustic performance with a higher bending stiffness than
   conventional hexagonal honeycomb sandwich structures, and the design of
   gradient DAHs can be extended to obtain optimized vibration and
   noise-control capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The investigation of the fatigue behaviour of an auxetic cellular
   structure made of Al-alloy 7075-T651 is presented in this study. The
   complete fatigue process of the analysed cellular structure is divided
   into the crack initiation (N-i) and crack propagation (N-p) period,
   where the total fatigue life (N-t) is defined as the sum of N-i and N-p.
   The crack initiation period, N-i, is determined using the strain life
   approach in the framework of the Fe-Safe computational code, where
   elastic-plastic numerical analysis is performed to obtain the total
   strain amplitude in the critical cross-section of the analysed cellular
   structure. The number of stress cycles, N-p, required for the fatigue
   crack propagation from the initial to the critical crack length is also
   determined numerically using a finite element model in the framework of
   the Abaqus computation FEM code. The Maximum Tensile Stress (MTS)
   criterion is considered when analysing the crack path inside the
   cellular structure. Finally, experimental fatigue testing has also been
   performed to validate the computational results.}},

Volume = {{328}},
Pages = {{340-364}},

Abstract = {{The application of auxetic composites in practice often relies on a
   compromise between properties as auxetics are mostly too porous (not
   dense enough or not stiff enough) to bear structural loads. Hence, the
   focus of this paper is topological design optimization of new
   functionally graded cellular composites with auxetics using a level set
   method. Firstly, a new hierarchical multiscale formulation is developed
   to account for both the auxetic behavior of the microstructure and the
   stiffness of the macrostructure. The composite, comprising multiple
   layers of periodic microstructures, is tailored to have functionally
   graded properties for stiffness and auxetic behaviors, subject to
   volumetric gradient constraints. Secondly, the microstructures
   underpinning composite layers are topologically designed under the
   consideration of boundary and loading conditions of the macrostructure.
   Finally, a level set method is applied to evolve the shape and topology
   of the microstructure for each layer, with the numerical homogenization
   method to evaluate the effective properties of the microstructures.
   Several numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed method. It can be seen that such composites systematically
   gear together the features of the functionally graded materials,
   cellular composites, and metamaterials towards a new kind of man-made
   composites. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This exploratory paper presents some preliminary results on the use of
   full-field deformation measurements on low-density polymeric foams to
   identify the evolution of Poisson's ratio with compressive strain. Two
   types of foams were tested: a standard low-density polyurethane foam and
   an auxetic foam manufactured from a similar precursor. Two-dimensional
   digital image correlation was used to measure the strain field at the
   specimens' surfaces. Then, Poisson's ratios were identified using a
   dedicated inverse method called the virtual fields method (VFM) and the
   results compared with the standard approaches. The results illustrate
   the advantages of the VFM compared to the standard procedure. It was
   also found that for the standard foam, very strong localization effects
   resulted in biased Poisson's ratio evaluation. It was shown that this
   could be corrected by taking into account these localization effects
   thanks to the full-field information.}},

Abstract = {{The six independent elastic constants (C-11, C-12, C-13, C-33, C-44, and
   C-66) of single-crystal MgF2 in the rutile structure have been measured
   by Brillouin spectroscopy at room temperature from ambient conditions to
   7.4 GPa. Measurements were performed on two monocrystals with
   perpendicular faces, (001) and (100). A quasi-linear fit from finite
   strain theory was applied to the experimental data revealing the
   pressure dependence of the six elastic constants of MgF2. The shear
   modulus C-S=1/2(C-11-C-12), and the aggregate shear (Voigt-Reuss-Hill)
   modulus G show a softening with increasing pressure, indicating the
   approach of the rutile-to-CaCl2-type structural phase transition at P
   similar to 9 GPa. The adiabatic bulk modulus (Reuss average) and its
   pressure derivative have been determined: K-OS=105.1 +/- 0.3 GPa,
   (partial derivative K-OS/partial derivative P)(T)=4.14 +/- 0.05. The
   pressure-volume equation of state of MgF2 was computed self-consistently
   from the Brillouin data. Our results are in good agreement with X-ray
   diffraction data. As the phase transition is approached, MgF2 becomes
   strongly anisotropic and develops partially auxetic behavior (a negative
   Poisson's ratio in certain directions). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Boltzmann-Volterra linear constitutive equation for isotropic
   non-aging visco-elastic materials is studied analytically in order to
   examine its capabilities to provide an adequate qualitative description
   of rheological phenomena related to creep under uni-axial loading
   combined with constant hydrostatic pressure and of evolution types of
   the Poisson's ratio (lateral contraction ratio) in creep. The
   constitutive equation does not involve the third invariants of stress
   and strain tensors and implies that their hydrostatic and deviatoric
   parts do not depend on each other. It is governed by two material
   functions of a positive real argument (that is shear and bulk creep
   compliances); they are implied to be positive, differentiable,
   increasing and convex up functions. General properties and
   characteristic features of the creep curves for volumetric, longitudinal
   and lateral strain produced by the linear theory (with an arbitrary
   shear and bulk creep functions) under constant tensile load and constant
   hydrostatic pressure are investigated. Conditions for creep curves
   monotonicity and for existence of extrema and sign changes of strains
   are studied. The Poisson's ratio evolution in time and its dependences
   on pressure and tensile stress levels and on qualitative characteristics
   of two creep functions are analyzed.
   Taking into account compressibility, volumetric creep and pressure
   influence (governed by the bulk creep function) affects strongly the
   qualitative behavior of longitudinal creep curves and the Poisson's
   ratio evolution and its range. In particular, it is proved that the
   linear theory can simulate non-monotone behavior and sign changes of
   lateral strain and Poisson's ratio under constant tensile load (even if
   the pressure is zero) and the longitudinal strain may start to decrease
   provided the pressure level is high enough.
   The expressions for Poisson's ratio via the strain triaxiality ratio
   (which is equal to volumetric strain divided by deviatoric strain) and
   in terms of pressure ratio to axial stress and the creep functions ratio
   are derived. Assuming creep functions are arbitrary (permissible),
   general accurate two-sided bounds for the Poisson's ratio range are
   obtained and the influence of pressure level on the range is studied.
   Additional restrictions on material functions and loading parameters are
   derived to provide negative values of Poisson's ratio. Criteria for the
   Poisson's ratio increase or decrease and for its non-dependence on time
   are found.
   The analysis revealed the set of immanent features and quantitative
   characteristics of the theoretic creep curves families and the Poisson's
   ratio dependence on time and pressure to axial stress ratio which are
   convenient to check in creep tests (with various levels of pressure and
   tensile stress) and can be employed as indicators of the linear
   viscoelasticity theory applicability (or non-applicability) for
   simulation of a material behavior. The specific properties and
   restrictions of the model with constant bulk creep compliance which
   simulates a material exhibiting purely elastic volumetric deformation
   are considered.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{The behavior of the f-electrons in the lanthanides and actinides governs
   important macroscopic properties but their pressure and temperature
   dependence is not fully explored. Cerium with nominally just one 4f
   electron offers a case study with its iso-structural volume collapse
   from the gamma-phase to the alpha-phase ending in a critical point
   (p(C), V-C, T-C), unique among the elements, whose mechanism remains
   controversial. Here, we present longitudinal (c(L)) and transverse sound
   speeds (c(T)) versus pressure from higher than room temperature to T-C
   for the first time. While c(L) experiences a non-linear dip at the
   volume collapse, c(T) shows a step-like change. This produces very
   peculiar macroscopic properties: the minimum in the bulk modulus becomes
   more pronounced, the step-like increase of the shear modulus diminishes
   and the Poisson's ratio becomes negative-meaning that cerium becomes
   auxetic. At the critical point itself cerium lacks any compressive
   strength but offers resistance to shear.}},

Title = {{Optimal turbine blade design enabled by auxetic honeycomb}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Gas turbine blades are subjected to unusually harsh operating
   conditions-rotating at high velocities in gas streams whose temperature
   can exceed the melting temperature of the blade. In order to survive
   these conditions, the blade must efficiently transfer heat to an
   internal cooling flow while effectively managing mechanical stresses.
   This work describes a new design strategy for the internal structure of
   turbine blades that makes use of architected materials tailored to
   reduce stresses and temperatures throughout the blade. A full 3D
   characterization was first performed to determine the thermomechanical
   properties of generalized honeycomb materials with different design
   parameters: honeycomb angle and wall thickness. A turbine blade cross
   section was then divided into multiple discrete domains so that
   different generalized honeycomb materials could be assigned to each of
   the domains. Optimization of the material assignments was performed in
   order to minimize the stress ratio-ratio of the maximum Mises' stress
   and the temperature dependent yield stress-in the entire model. The
   optimized design showed substantial improvement with respect to a
   baseline model; the factor of safety was increased by 171\%, while the
   maximum Mises' stress and temperature decreased by 42\% and 72\%
   respectively. The use of generalized honeycomb materials allows for
   local control of the material properties to tune the performance of the
   turbine blade. The results of the optimization clearly indicate that
   auxetic honeycombs outperform conventional designs; since their lower
   in-plane stiffness helps to reduce stresses caused by thermal gradients.
   Our results demonstrated the feasibility of using 3D-printing compatible
   architected materials in turbine blades to increase their factor of
   safety and potentially increase operating temperatures to improve
   thermal efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering is replete with methods for inducing and mediating
   cell differentiation, which are crucial for ensuring proper regrowth of
   desired tissues. In this study, we developed a 3D-printed, non-positive
   Poisson's Ratio (NPPR) scaffold intended for future use in
   stretch-mediated cell differentiation applications, such as in muscle
   and tendon regeneration. We utilized dynamic optical projection
   stereolithography (DOPsL) to fabricate multi-layered, cell-laden NPPR
   scaffolds these scaffolds can not only support aggregate cell growth,
   but can also be printed with locally-tunable force-displacement
   properties at length scales appropriate for tissue interaction. These
   NPPR multilayered mesh scaffolds can be embedded into highly elastic
   hydrogels in order to couple a reduced NPPR behavior to a normally
   Positive Poisson's Ratio (PPR) solid bulk material. This hybrid
   structure may potentially enable induced `auxetic' behavior at the
   single-cell scale while tuning the Poisson's Ratio to a more isolated
   value. This would be uniquely suited for providing stretch-mediated
   effects for various cell-types within the tendon-to-muscle tissue
   transition.}},

Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{An investigation of Poisson's ratios and band gap behaviors of 2D
   hierarchical re-entrant lattice structures is conducted using finite
   element method (FEM). The structure with a hierarchy order n (n >= 1) is
   constructed by replacing each outmost vertex of the re-entrant octagons
   of a hierarchical structure of hierarchy order n-1 with a smaller
   self-similar re-entrant octagon. The dispersion relation and
   transmission spectrum of the proposed hierarchical structures are
   analyzed based on the Bloch's theorem. The effects of geometrical
   parameters, order of rotational symmetry and orientation angle of some
   types of re-entrant polygon cores on the lattice Poisson's ratio and
   band gap structures are also investigated. Results show that the
   re-entrant structures with first order hierarchy exhibit a wider band
   gap and a stronger attenuation effect compared with structures without
   structural hierarchy. The first order 2D hierarchical re-entrant
   structure with a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.032 exhibits the widest
   band gap, 17.8\% wider than that of the zeroth order 2D re-entrant
   structure. The order of rotational symmetry and the orientation angle of
   the re-entrant polygon cores of the lattice have a strong impact on the
   lattice Poisson's ratio and band structures.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Deployable structures are physical mechanisms that can easily transition
   between two or more geometric configurations; such structures enable
   industrial, scientific, and consumer applications at a wide variety of
   scales. This paper develops novel deployable structures that can
   approximate a large class of doubly-curved surfaces and are easily
   actuated from a flat initial state via inflation or gravitational
   loading. The structures are based on two-dimensional rigid mechanical
   linkages that implicitly encode the curvature of the target shape via a
   user-programmable pattern that permits locally isotropic scaling under
   load. We explicitly characterize the shapes that can be realized by such
   structures-in particular, we show that they can approximate target
   surfaces of positive mean curvature and bounded scale distortion
   relative to a given reference domain. Based on this observation, we
   develop efficient computational design algorithms for approximating a
   given input geometry. The resulting designs can be rapidly manufactured
   via digital fabrication technologies such as laser cutting, CNC milling,
   or 3D printing. We validate our approach through a series of physical
   prototypes and present several application case studies, ranging from
   surgical implants to large-scale deployable architecture.}},

Title = {{Auxetic Tetrahex Carbon with Ultrahigh Strength and a Direct Band Gap}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{Tetrahex carbon is a recently predicted two-dimensional (2D) carbon
   allotrope that is composed of tetragonal and hexagonal rings. Unlike
   flat graphene, this new 2D carbon structure is buckled and possesses a
   direct band gap of approximately 2.6 eV and a high carrier mobility of
   approximately 10(4)cm(2)/(Vs) with anisotropic features. In this work,
   we employ first-principles density-functional theory calculations to
   explore the mechanical properties of tetrahex C under uniaxial tensile
   strain. We find that tetrahex C demonstrates ultrahigh ideal strength,
   outperforming both graphene and pentagraphene. It shows superior
   ductility and sustains uniaxial tensile strain up to 20\% (16\%) until
   phonon instability occurs and the corresponding maximal strength is 38.3
   N/m (37.8 N/m) in the zigzag (armchair) direction. It shows an
   intrinsically negative Poisson ratio. This exotic in-plane Poisson ratio
   takes place when the axial strain reaches a threshold value of 7\% (5\%)
   in the zigzag (armchair) direction. We also find that tetrahex C
   maintains a direct band gap of 2.64 eV at the center of the Brillouin
   zone. This direct-gap feature remains intact upon strain application,
   with no direct-indirect gap transition. The ultrahigh ideal strength,
   the negative Poisson ratio, and the integrity of the direct gap under
   strain in tetrahex C suggest that it may have potential applications in
   nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic open cell polyurethane (PU) foams have been manufactured and
   mechanically characterised under cyclic tensile loading. The classical
   manufacturing process for auxetic PU foams involves multiaxial
   compression of the conventional parent foam, and heating of the
   compressed specimens above the T-m of the foam polymer. Eighty
   cylindrical specimens were fabricated using manufacturing routes
   modified from those in the open literature, with different temperatures
   (135 degrees C, 150 degrees C), compression ratios and different cooling
   methods (water or room temperature exposure). Compressive tensile cyclic
   loading has been applied to measure tangent modulus, Poisson's ratios
   and energy dissipated per unit volume. The results are used to obtain
   relations between manufacturing parameters, mechanical and hysteresis
   properties of the foams. Compression, both radial and axial, was found
   to be the most significant manufacturing parameter for the auxetic foams

Abstract = {{The linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (L-PB) equation is examined for its
   -range of validity (, Debye reciprocal length). This is done for the
   Debye-Huckel (DH) theory, i.e., using a single ion size, and for the SiS
   treatment (D. Fraenkel, Mol. Phys. 2010, 108, 1435), which extends the
   DH theory to the case of ion-size dissimilarity (therefore dubbed
   DH-SiS). The linearization of the PB equation has been claimed
   responsible for the DH theory's failure to fit with experiment at>0.1 m;
   but DH-SiS fits with data of the mean ionic activity coefficient, (+/-)
   (molal), against m, even at m>1 (>0.33 angstrom(-1)). The SiS
   expressions combine the overall extra-electrostatic potential energy of
   the smaller ion, as central ion(a>b)(), with that of the larger ion, as
   central ion(b>a)(); a and b are, respectively, the counterion and co-ion
   distances of closest approach. (a>b) and (b>a) are derived from the L-PB
   equation, which appears to conflict with their being effective up to
   moderate electrolyte concentrations (approximate to 1 m). However, the
   L-PB equation can be valid up to 1.3 angstrom(-1) if one abandons the 1/
   criterion for its effectiveness and, instead, use, as criterion, the
   mean-field electrostatic interaction potential of the central ion with
   its ion cloud, at a radial distance dividing the cloud charge into two
   equal parts. The DH theory's failure is, thus, not because of using the
   L-PB equation; the lethal approximation is assigning a single size to
   the positive and negative ions. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the presence of signal-independent
   additive noise. However, for imaging in presence of only
   signal-dependent shot noise, multiplexing has been shown to
   significantly degrade SNR. Hence, multiplexing to increase SNR in
   presence of Poisson noise is normally thought to be infeasible. In this
   paper, we present an exception to this view by demonstrating
   multiplexing advantage when the scene parameters are non-negative valued
   and are observed through a low-rate Poisson channel.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, making use of the coupled deformation features of
   reentrant and tetrachiral lattices, innovative 3D chiral metamaterials
   are designed, in which their mechanical properties and deformation
   mechanisms are explored in details. Firstly, three types of innovative
   3D chiral metamaterials are designed based on geometry topology in the
   (x) over bar(y) over bar plane, namely: tetrachiral, anti-tetrachiral
   and hybrid-tetrachiral, respectively. Secondly, the coupled tension and
   rotation deformation mechanisms of innovative 3D chiral metamaterials
   are investigated based on large deformation theories of representative
   unit cell. The theoretical formulas for extension stress, Poisson's
   ratio and rotation angle of the square loop are derived, it is found
   that wide range of negative Poisson's ratio can be obtained with the
   proposed 3D chiral metamaterials. Afterwards, tensile experiments are
   performed, and good agreements between theoretical, finite element and
   experimental results are presented, verifying the reliability of the
   theoretical models. Finally, influences of the geometry parameters on
   the mechanical behaviors of the proposed 3D auxetic metamaterials are
   also studied. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A crash-prediction model for multilane roads}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{657-670}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Considerable research has been carried out in recent years to establish
   relationships between crashes and traffic flow, geometric infrastructure
   characteristics and environmental factors for two-lane rural roads.
   Crash-prediction models focused on multilane rural roads, however, have
   rarely been investigated. In addition, most research has paid but little
   attention to the safety effects of variables such as stopping sight
   distance and pavement surface characteristics. Moreover, the statistical
   approaches have generally included Poisson and Negative Binomial
   regression models, whilst Negative Multinomial regression model has been
   used to a lesser extent. Finally, as far as the authors are aware,
   prediction models involving all the above-mentioned factors have still
   not been developed in Italy for multilane roads, such as motorways.
   Thus, in this paper crash-prediction models for a four-lane
   median-divided Italian motorway were set up on the basis of accident
   data observed during a 5-year monitoring period extending between 1999
   and 2003. The Poisson, Negative Binomial and Negative Multinomial
   regression models, applied separately to tangents and curves, were used
   to model the frequency of accident occurrence. Model parameters were
   estimated by the Maximum Likelihood Method, and the Generalized
   Likelihood Ratio Test was applied to detect the significant variables to
   be included in the model equation. Goodness-of-fit was measured by means
   of both the explained fraction of total variation and the explained
   fraction of systematic variation. The Cumulative Residuals Method was
   also used to test the adequacy of a regression model throughout the
   range of each variable. The candidate set of explanatory variables was:
   length (L). curvature (1/R), annual average daily traffic (AADT), sight
   distance (SD), side friction coefficient (SFC), longitudinal slope (LS)
   and the presence of a junction (J). Separate prediction models for total
   crashes and for fatal and injury crashes only were considered. For
   curves it is shown that significant variables are L, 1/R and AADT,
   whereas for tangents they are L, AADT and junctions. The effect of rain
   precipitation was analysed on the basis of hourly rainfall data and
   assumptions about drying time. It is shown that a wet pavement
   significantly increases the number of crashes.
   The models developed in this paper for Italian motorways appear to be
   useful for many applications such as the detection of critical factors,
   the estimation of accident reduction due to infrastructure and pavement
   improvement, and the predictions of accidents counts when comparing
   different design options. Thus this research may represent a point of
   reference for engineers in adjusting or designing multilane roads. (c)

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We show that a mechanically driven magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in
   magneto-auxetic systems (MASs) in the vicinity of room temperature is
   possible and the effect can be colossal. Even at zero external magnetic
   field, the magnetic entropy change in this reversible process can be a
   few times larger in magnitude than in the case of the giant MCE
   discovered by Pecharsky and Gschneidner in Gd-5(Si2Ge2). MAS represent a
   novel class of metamaterials having magnetic insertions embedded within
   a non-magnetic matrix which exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio. The
   auxetic behaviour of the non-magnetic matrix may either enhance the
   magnetic ordering process or it may result in a transition to the
   disordered phase. In the MAS under consideration, a spin 1/2 system is
   chosen for the magnetic component and the well-known Onsager solution
   for the two-dimensional square lattice Ising model at zero external
   magnetic field is used to show that the isothermal change in magnetic
   entropy accompanying the auxetic behaviour can take a large value at
   room temperature. The practical importance of our findings is that MCE
   materials used in present engineering applications may be further
   enhanced by changing their geometry such that they exhibit auxetic
   behaviour.}},

   different impact energy levels ranging from 12.7 to 25.5 J. Results show
   that the 3D auxetic textile composite has better impact protective
   performance than the 3D non-auxetic textile composite due to better
   transmitted force reduction and higher energy absorption capacity under
   single-time impact and higher structural stability under repeating
   impacts. The results also show that the difference in protective

   along the x-direction}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{145}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical property of anti-trichiral honeycombs under large
   deformation along the x-direction are studied by both experiments and
   theoretical analysis. It's shown that the elastic-plasticity bending
   occurs in the ligaments besides the plastic hinges, which is very
   different from the deformation mode under the y-directional compression
   reported previously. Based on the cells' deformation mechanism observed
   in experiments, an analytical model is established to derive the
   Poisson's ratio and the crushing stress of the anti-trichiral honeycomb.
   The theoretical predictions are verified by the experimental results. It
   is shown that the crushing stress increases with the wall thickness t,
   but decreases with the ligament's length L. As for the Poisson's ratio,
   it increases with L, but decreases with the honeycomb's deformation,
   while the ligament's wall thickness t makes no difference to it.
   Moreover, it is revealed that the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the
   anti-trichiral honeycomb under the x-directional compression is stronger
   than that under the y-directional compression, while the superiority of
   the crushing stress along these two directions depends on the cell's

Abstract = {{The present article is focused on investigating the influence of process
   parameters under compressive loading in case of reentrant auxetic
   structures fabricated by fused deposition modeling (FDM). Auxetic
   structures of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and poly-lactic acid
   (PLA) materials are fabricated. Three process parameters of FDM namely
   layer thickness, raster angle, and number of contours are considered to
   investigate their influence on compressive strength, stiffness, and
   specific energy absorption (SEA). Experiments are performed on the basis
   of central composite design and analysis is performed using ANOVA. It is
   found that compressive strength of auxetic structure improves with
   increase in layer thickness. But with increase in raster angle, it
   increases first and then decreases. Compressive stiffness of structures
   initially decreases and then increases with increase in raster angle,
   while it increases with increase in number of contours. SEA of
   structures increases with decrease in layer thickness. Based on the
   analysis of experimental results, regression models are developed to
   predict these responses. Also, multi-response optimization is performed
   to optimize strength, stiffness, and SEA. Auxetic structures failed
   under compressive loading are also examined using scanning electron
   microscope.}},

Abstract = {{Oxide spinels of general formula AB(2)O(4) (A = Mg2+, Fe2+; B = Al3+,
   Cr3+, etc.) constitute one of the most abundant crystalline structures
   in mineralogy. In this structure, cations distribute among octahedral
   and tetrahedral sites, according to their size and the crystal-field
   stabilization energy. The cationic arrangement determines the
   mechanical, magnetic, and transport properties of the spinel and can be
   influenced by external parameters like temperature, pressure, or
   epitudal stress in the case of thin films. Here, we report a progressive
   change in the sign of the Poisson ratio, v, in thin films of CoFe2O4,
   defining a smooth crossover from auxetic (v < 0) to non-auxetic (v > 0)
   behavior in response to epitaxial stress and temperature.
   Microstructural and magnetization studies, as well as ab initio
   calculations, demonstrate that such unusual elastic response is actually
   due to a progressive redistribution of Co2+ among the octahedral and
   tetrahedral sites of the spinel structure. The results presented in this
   work clarify a long standing controversy about the magnetic and elastic
   properties of Co-ferrites and are of general applicability for
   understanding the stress-relaxation mechanism in complex crystalline
   structures. (C) 2019 Author(s).}},

Title = {{A simple equivalent method for orthogonal assembling three-dimensional
   composite structures elastic parameters}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Research on metamaterials has attracted more and more attention, along
   with the design of various new 3D metamaterials, in which orthogonal
   assembling is a typical way of constructing such structures. For this
   kind of 3D orthogonal assembling structure, determining the equivalent
   elastic parameters of these 3D materials is important for mechanical
   analysis. However, because of the complexity, researchers tend to use
   finite element simulations or experimental methods, with little use of
   theoretical derivation solutions. In the present paper, we establish a
   mechanical model for determining the equivalent elastic parameters of a
   3D orthogonal assembling model. The equivalent formula of the 3D
   structure's elastic parameter can be obtained by using the known elastic
   parameters of the corresponding 2D structure. The applicability of the
   formula is verified through comparison with the results in the
   literature. Compared with existing methods for directly analyzing a
   specific 3D structure, this method is simpler and has great generality,
   which can provide assistance in the design and performance prediction of
   such structures.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{38}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Elastic properties of metal nanowires in a transverse electric field
   have been investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and
   classical electrostatics theory. The negative pressure on the surfaces
   stemming from the transverse electric field modifies the Young's modulus
   and Poisson's ratio of nanowires significantly. The simulation results
   reveal the decrease in Young's modulus and the increase in Poisson's
   ratio as a result of the negative pressure. With the increase of the
   applied voltage and decreasing the distance between the nanowire and the
   ground plane, the electromechanical coupling effect on elastic
   properties of nanowires becomes more remarkable. The relative change of
   elastic properties is also strongly dependent on the diameter of
   nanowires. The present results are useful in the design of
   nanoelectromechanical systems and the measurement of mechanical
   properties of one-dimensional nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers two aspects for enhancing structural damping using
   passive, but novel, methods. Attempting to take a forward look to the
   twenty-first century, the concept of using biological and evolutionary
   methods to `grow' damping material on the surface of a vibrating
   component is described. A simple cantilever beam is used as the
   component and a `free-layer' viscoelastic damping treatment is `grown'
   on the structure in such a way as to provide optimum damping over a
   frequency bandwidth that encompasses flexural and torsional modes of
   vibration. To enhance the `controllability' of the damping, the
   viscoelastic material is considered as a cellular material displaying a
   negative Poisson's ratio and it is shown that for the `free-layer'
   treatment it is possible to produce a range of modal loss factors by
   changing the cell geometry. Only numerical studies are used and no
   experimental validation has been carried out, the idea being to
   stimulate ideas for future structural damping concepts.}},

   According to our model, this origami mechanism supports response to

Abstract = {{Complex inertial Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) usually require
   the simultaneous motion of the masses in more than one direction and an
   overall linear behavior. Furthermore, since it is usually very difficult
   to actuate the device in all the required directions, complex spring
   configurations for the conversion of the motion are needed. Here we
   present possible solutions to this problem through auxetic structures.
   The goal of the work is to propose a new topology optimization procedure
   which can be used as a tool during the design phase of the optimal
   auxetic structure, that is completely compatible with the MEMS
   fabrication processes available so far and that allows the motion
   conversion in a MEMS device without entering the nonlinear regime.}},

   and Mechanical Properties of Sandstone Subjected to Uniaxial Compression}},
Journal = {{GEOFLUIDS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{2021}},
Month = {{MAR 9}},
Abstract = {{Ultrasonic wave velocity is effective to evaluate anisotropy property
   and predict rock failure. This paper investigates the correlation
   between dynamic ultrasonic and mechanical properties of sandstones with
   different buried depths subjected to uniaxial compression tests. The
   circumferential anisotropy and axial wave velocity of sandstone are
   obtained by means of ultrasonic wave velocity measurements. The
   mechanical properties, including Young's modulus and uniaxial
   compressive strength, are positively correlated with the axial P wave
   velocity. The average angles between the sandstone failure plane and the
   minimum and maximum wave directions are 35.8 degrees and 63.3 degrees,
   respectively. The axial P wave velocity almost keeps constant, and the
   axial S wave velocity has a decreasing trend before the failure of rock
   specimen. In most rock samples under uniaxial compression, shear failure
   occurs in the middle and splitting appears near both sides.
   Additionally, the dynamic Young's modulus and dynamic Poisson's ratio
   during loading are obtained, and the negative values of the Poisson's
   ratio occur at the initial compression stage. Distortion and rotation of
   micro/mesorock structures may be responsible for the negative Poisson's
   ratio.}},

Title = {{Consistent evaluation of continuum scale properties of two-dimensional
   materials: a case study on graphene}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{We handshake statistical mechanics with continuum mechanics to develop a
   methodology for consistent evaluation of the continuum scale properties
   of two-dimensional materials. The methodology is tested on pristine
   graphene. Our scope is kept limited to elastic modulus,E, which has been
   reported to vary between 0.912 TPa and 7 TPa, Poisson's ratio,nu, which
   has been reported to vary from being negative to a value as large as
   0.46, and effective thickness,q, whose value varies between 0.75
   angstrom and 3.41 angstrom. Such a large scatter arises due to
   inconsistent evaluation of these properties and making assumptions that
   may not be valid at atomistic scales. Our methodology combines three
   separate methods: uniaxial tension, equibiaxial tension, and flexural
   out-of-plane free vibrations of simply supported sheets, which, when
   used in tandem in molecular dynamics, can provide consistent values
   ofE,nu andq. The only assumption made in the present study is the
   validity of the continuum scale thin plate vibration equation to
   represent the free vibrations of a graphene sheet. Our results suggest
   that-(i) graphene is auxetic in nature, (ii)Edecreases with increasing
   size and temperature, and (iii) the effective thicknessqincreases with
   increasing size and temperature. Further, a robustness study of the
   computed mechanical properties shows consistent results, with
   differences varying between 1.4\% and 6\%.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are promising structural and functional candidates due
   to their unique lateral expansion when stretched, however, bulk metallic
   glasses (MGs) could not show any auxeticity because of their intrinsic
   isotropic nature. Here we construct chiral Cu50Zr50 metallic glass
   nanolattices with cavities, and investigate their auxeticity and
   underlying mechanism with molecular dynamics simulations. It is found
   that, compared to monolithic MGs, all the chiral metallic glass
   nanolattices (CMGNs) exhibit improved auxeticity and lower density. For
   CMGNs with cavities, the negative Poisson's ratio and ultimate tensile
   strength (UTS) increase first and then decrease with increasing cavity
   radius, with the cavity radius of 2.5 nm being the most favorable for
   auxeticity and enhanced UTS. The auxetic mechanism is attributed to the
   competition between rotation behavior and non-affine deformation under
   tension. Our study not only reveals the mechanism of auxeticity in CMGNs
   having cavities but also provides a feasible method to optimize their
   auxetic performance and density by structure designing of MGs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the geometry of an auxetic, re-entrant honeycomb structure
   made from Inconel 718 (IN718), was optimised with respect to the process
   parameters of laser melting process using a Renishaw AM250 after which
   the quasi static behaviour was analysed under tensile loading. Two
   different PBF process parameters were used with 2 different laser energy
   densities to manufacture the auxetic structures with 3 different strut
   thicknesses (0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 mm) in 2 building orientations (XY and ZX
   plane). A strut thickness of 0.6 mm was found to have the least porosity
   and the best dimensional accuracy. The latter geometry was then
   manufactured as part of a tensile test sample which were then tested at
   a strain rate of 0.001 s' after which the stress strain curve, yield
   stress, structural stiffness, plastic work and Poisson's Ratio were
   compared. The building directions XY, ZX and XZ of the auxetic structure
   were investigated, as well as the orientation of the individual cells
   with respect to the loading direction. XY was found to provide the best
   mechanical properties and the kinematics of deformation was found to be
   dependent on the loading direction with respect to the cells direction
   which resulted in a significant change in Poisson's ratio. Finite
   Element Analysis was also done in order to compare the stress strain
   curves and the deformation mode obtained from numerical modelling and
   experiment, and a good agreement was observed.}},

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{112}},

Abstract = {{Majority of the available research on buckling analysis of the plates,
   has been devoted to plates with well-behaved configurations, e.g.,
   rectangular or circular geometries. In the present research, thermal
   buckling of general quadrilateral plates fabricated from heterogeneous,
   orthotropic, and auxetic (with negative Poisson ratio) materials resting
   on elastic Winkler-Pasternak elastic media is investigated. Edges of the
   plate may be either simply supported or clamped. Thus, the problem is a
   quite general one, from the material, boundary conditions, and to some
   extent, geometry points of view and may cover wide ranges of the
   practical applications, as special cases. The stability equations are
   derived through transformation of the governing equations of the plate
   from the geometric rectangular Cartesian coordinates to the
   computational natural coordinates and discretization of the resulting
   equations by means of the differential quadratic method. Buckling
   analysis has been accomplished through investigation of the pre-buckling
   and buckling onset situations. Finally, effects of the skew angles of
   the general quadrilateral plate, heterogeneity index, orthotropy angle,
   edge condition, foundation stiffness, and auxeticity of the material on
   the buckling temperature rises are investigated comprehensively.}},

Abstract = {{The psyllid Triozoida limbata (Enderlein) (Hemiptera: Triozidae) is a
   major pest in guava, feeding primarily on new shoots. Despite its
   importance, there are no studies on the spatial distribution of T.
   limbata on guava. Such studies are needed to establish sequential
   sampling plans for decision making in pest control. Thus, an experiment
   was carried out in a 9-year-old commercial guava orchard divided into
   100 sampling units or plots. Double-sided yellow sticky traps were
   placed on one plant per plot (sample unit) to capture and monitor T.
   limbata adults from April 2011 to May 2012. To determine the insect
   distribution in the area, we calculated the variance-to-mean ratio index
   (I), the Morisita index (I (delta) ), Green's coefficient (Cx), and the
   k exponent of the negative binomial distribution. Most of the samples
   showed that the adults had a moderate to highly aggregated distribution.
   Statistical models were also used to study the pest spatial distribution
   by fitting the number of adults captured to the Poisson and negative
   binomial distributions. The negative binomial distribution model best
   fitted the data of the number of adult psyllids captured by the traps,
   which is consistent with an aggregated distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental study was performed to investigate fracture and impact

   lengths and three different fiber densities were flocked between
   laminates. Vacuum infusion process along with optimized compaction was
   employed to fabricate composites. The double cantilever beam
   configuration was used to investigate the fracture properties. The
   Auxetic Kevlar (R) composites showed a significant improvement of 225\%
   in fracture toughness compared to regular woven Kevlar (R) composites.
   Furthermore, the initiation toughness was increased by 577\% with the
   application of flocking in Auxetic Kevlar (R). During impact testing,
   the Auxetic Kevlar (R) reinforced composites showed a significant
   reduction in damaged area compared to woven counterpart. On the other
   hand, the reduction in damaged area influenced the reduction in impact
   energy absorption.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the analytical model to predict the effective
   in-plane shear modulus G12{*} for auxetic honeycomb mesostructure with
   sinusoidal re-entrant wall. Also, a comparative study is conducted on
   the ability of the sinusoidal mesostructure over auxetic mesostructure
   for high shear flexure. In an effort to design components with high
   shear flexure, the re-entrant wall of the auxetic honeycomb is replaced
   with a sinusoidal wall. Existing analytical models that predict the
   effective in-plane elastic properties for auxetic honeycomb
   mesostructure are limited to straight re-entrant wall. In order to
   predict the effective in plane shear modulus, G12{*}, for conceptual
   design study, an analytical model is needed. The principle of energy
   methods is used to determine the effective in-plane shear modulus and is
   verified with the solution in ABAQUS. The analytical model is in
   agreement with the computational model with a 10\% maximum error over a
   wide range of cell wall thickness and shear strain. The two structures
   are designed to possess the same equivalent shear modulus and the degree
   of shear flexure is measured computationally in terms of yield shear
   strain. The sinusoidal structure introduces nonlinearity with increase
   in cell wall thickness and shear strain. This nonlinearity causes the
   sinusoidal auxetic mesostructure to have low shear flexure at a high
   shear modulus which is higher than about 1 OMPa. However, it is
   marginally better than auxetic mesostructure at a low shear modulus
   which is 10MPa and less.}},

Abstract = {{Spider silks possess nature's most exceptional mechanical properties,
   with unrivalled extensibility and high tensile strength. Unfortunately,
   our understanding of silks is limited because the complete elastic
   response has never been measured-leaving a stark lack of essential
   fundamental information. Using non-invasive, non-destructive Brillouin
   light scattering, we obtain the entire stiffness tensors (revealing
   negative Poisson's ratios), refractive indices, and longitudinal and
   transverse sound velocities for major and minor ampullate spider silks:
   Argiope aurantia, Latrodectus hesperus, Nephila clavipes, Peucetia
   viridans. These results completely quantify the linear elastic response
   for all possible deformation modes, information unobtainable with
   traditional stress-strain tests. For completeness, we apply the
   principles of Brillouin imaging to spatially map the elastic stiffnesses
   on a spider web without deforming or disrupting the web in a
   non-invasive, non-contact measurement, finding variation among discrete
   fibres, junctions and glue spots. Finally, we provide the stiffness
   changes that occur with supercontraction.}},

Abstract = {{In previous work about axisymmetric adhesive contact on power-law graded
   elastic materials, the contact interface was often assumed to be
   frictionless, which is, however, not always the case in practical
   applications. In order to elucidate the effect of friction and the
   coupling between normal and tangential deformations, in the present
   paper, the problem of a rigid punch with a parabolic shape in
   non-slipping adhesive contact with a power-law graded half-space is
   studied analytically via singular integral equation method. A series of
   closed-form analytical solutions, which include the frictionless and
   homogeneous solutions as special cases, are obtained. Our results show
   that, compared with the frictionless case, the interfacial friction
   tends to reduce the contact area and the indentation depth during
   adhesion. The magnitude of the coupling effect depends on both the
   Poisson ratio and the gradient exponent of the half-space. This effect
   vanishes for homogeneous incompressible as well as for linearly graded
   materials but becomes significant for auxetic materials with negative
   Poisson's ratio. Furthermore, influence of mode mixity on the adhesive
   behavior of power-law graded materials, which was seldom touched in
   literature, is discussed in details. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Metamaterials produced using additive manufacturing represent advanced
   structures with tunable properties and deformation characteristics.
   However, the manufacturing process, imperfections in geometry,
   properties of the base material as well as the ambient and operating
   conditions often result in complex multiparametric dependence of the
   mechanical response. As the lattice structures are metamaterials that
   can be tailored for energy absorption applications and impact
   protection, the investigation of the coupled thermomechanical response
   and ambient temperature-dependent properties is particularly important.
   Herein, the 2D re-entrant honeycomb auxetic lattice structures
   additively manufactured from powdered stainless steel are subjected to
   high strain rate uniaxial compression using split Hopkinson pressure bar
   (SHPB) at two different strain rates and three different temperatures.
   An in-house developed cooling and heating stages are used to control the
   temperature of the specimen subjected to high strain rate impact
   loading. Thermal imaging and high-speed cameras are used to inspect the
   specimens during the impact. It is shown that the stress-strain response
   as well as the crushing behavior of the investigated lattice structures
   are strongly dependent on both initial temperature and strain rate.}},

Abstract = {{Count data often display excessive number of zero outcomes than are
   expected in the Poisson regression model. The zero-inflated Poisson
   regression model has been suggested to handle zero-inflated data,
   whereas the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model has
   been fitted for zero-inflated data with additional overdispersion. For
   bivariate and zero-inflated cases, several regression models such as the
   bivariate zero-inflated Poisson (BZIP) and bivariate zero-inflated
   negative binomial (BZINB) have been considered. This paper introduces
   several forms of nested BZINB regression model which can be fitted to
   bivariate and zero-inflated count data. The mean-variance approach is
   used for comparing the BZIP and our forms of BZINB regression model in
   this study. A similar approach was also used by past researchers for
   defining several negative binomial and zero-inflated negative binomial
   regression models based on the appearance of linear and quadratic terms
   of the variance function. The nested BZINB regression models proposed in
   this study have several advantages; the likelihood ratio tests can be
   performed for choosing the best model, the models have flexible forms of
   marginal mean-variance relationship, the models can be fitted to
   bivariate zero-inflated count data with positive or negative
   correlations, and the models allow additional overdispersion of the two
   dependent variables.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with experimental investigation into a strain-rate
   dependent function of Poisson's ratio of three auxetic structures
   subjected to compressive loading. The missing rib, the 2D re-entrant
   honeycomb, and the 3D re-entrant honeycomb lattices printed using
   selective laser sintering from powdered SS316L austenitic steel are
   investigated. The samples are subjected to uni-axial compression under
   quasi-static conditions and dynamic conditions using the Split Hopkinson
   Pressure Bar (SHPB). The deforming specimens are optically observed in
   order to apply a digital image correlation for evaluation of the
   in-plane displacement and strain fields. From the calculated strain
   fields, the function of Poisson's ratio is calculated for each
   experiment using different methods taking specific regions of interest
   of the specimen microstructures into account. The obtained functions of
   Poisson's ratio are plotted for each microstructure and strain-rate. The
   analysis of the results shows that the strain-rate has a significant
   influence on the deformation characteristics of all the investigated
   microstructures yielding differences in the magnitude of the minima of
   Poisson's ratio and the differences in the maximum overall compressive
   strain, where the lattices are still auxetic.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogels have been used as substrates for studying the cellular
   processes by many researchers. The stiffness of such gels was also
   characterized previously. However, in most of the cases, these soft
   Poisson's ratio was assumed incompressible and Poisson's ratio is
   assumed to be one-half. This may not be true in many cases, and might
   alter the calculation of the stiffness of the gels. In this study, we
   present equations for the complete characterization of soft media, i.e.,
   calculation of Young's modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio. The
   method involves the individual measurement of either the displacement or
   rotation of cylindrical rods embedded in the soft media, under the
   application of an external force or torque. Equations involving shear
   modulus and Poisson's ratio for rotation of the rod and Young's modulus
   and Poisson's ratio for the displacement of the rod are independently
   derived. In addition, the displacement and rotation of the rods embedded
   in an elastic medium, under the application of either a force or a
   torque, respectively, were also calculated using finite element
   analysis. These values compared well with the displacements and
   rotations obtained using closed form equations. (C) 2009 American

Abstract = {{With their increased energy absorption capacity, auxetic materials are
   perfectly fit to develop new, enhanced lightweight crash absorbers for
   cars. Herein, the mass distribution along the struts is optimized via
   finite element analysis with a parameterized optimization. Four
   different auxetic unit cells are taken from the literature and their
   struts parameterize, the models simulate, and the mass specific energy
   absorption capacity optimizes. The two models with the highest energy
   absorption capacity are then selected for experimental investigation and
   produced by additive manufacturing from a polymer. To further enhance
   the mechanical properties, the specimens are electrochemically coated
   with nickel and the polymer molten out by pyrolysis. Those Ni/polymer
   hybrids are subjected to quasistatic and dynamic impact experiments.
   Only a small strain rate sensitivity can be detected under dynamic
   loading, namely, a higher plastic collapse and higher plateau stress.
   The hollow struts are folding instead of bending, which render them much
   weaker than predicted by the simulation. In conclusion, it is possible
   to improve existing crash absorber elements with tailored auxetic hybrid
   structures. They absorb higher amounts of energy without changing their
   stiffness under dynamic loading while saving mass and cost.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we design and experimentally validate an auxetic
   nonlinear piezoelectric energy harvester. This harvester adopts a
   clamp-clamp beam with auxetic structures, which can improve the

   analysis is performed to analyse the effects of the auxetic structures
   on the efficiency and nonlinearity of the energy harvester. The lumped
   parameter model is utilized to predict the performance of the energy
   harvester, which well matches the experimental results. In the
   experimental validation, at 0.1 g base acceleration, the power output of
   the two types of auxetic energy harvesters is 173\% and 94\% higher than
   the conventional nonlinear energy harvester. Besides, the bandwidths of
   the two types of auxetic energy harvesters are broadened by 1556\% and

   tensile-rotational mechanisms. These structures offer high deployability
   ratios in structural elements with load-bearing characteristics. Shape
   memory polymers have the potential to replace these shape memory alloys
   and other stored-energy actuators, and have the attractive properties of
   low mass, high actuation strain, easy fabrication and tuneable thermal
   properties. In this work we discuss how shape memory polymers (SMP)
   integrated into a chiral core could offer enhanced deployable
   characteristics and increase the efficiency of the auxetic deformations
   in these unusual cellular structures. We consider the spiral-wound
   fundamental component needed for SMP n-chiral prototypes and present
   test results showing actuation motion of expanding SMP deployable
   structures. Applications likely to benefit from these structures include
   lightweight elements for structural engineering applications, deployable
   structures for space applications and implantable medical devices.}},

Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Deployable geometries are finite auxetic structures that preserve their
   overall shapes during expansion and contraction. The topological
   behaviors emerge from intricately arranged elements and their
   connections. Despite the considerable utility of such configurations in
   nature and in engineering, deployable nanostructures have never been
   demonstrated. Here a deployable flight ring, a simplified planar
   structure of Hoberman sphere is shown, using DNA origami. The DNA flight
   ring consists of topologically assembled six triangles in two layers
   that can slide against each other, thereby switching between two
   distinct (open and closed) states. The origami topology is a trefoil
   knot, and its auxetic reconfiguration results in negative Poisson's
   ratios. This work shows the feasibility of deployable nanostructures,
   providing a versatile platform for topological studies and opening new
   opportunities for bioengineering.}},

Title = {{Active control for ratios of strains in functionally graded
   piezoelectric composites}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{236}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio measured by the ratio of transverse strain to
   longitudinal strain is an important intrinsic property of materials.
   Imitating the definition of Poisson's ratio, we define that the ratio of
   strains is denoted by the ratio of any two normal strains. Nowadays,
   some design methods have been proposed to tailor the ratios of strains
   by changing Poisson's ratio in materials. However, the ranges of the
   ratios of strains by available methods are too narrow, the technology
   can provide materials with tailorable ratios of strains over an
   extremely wide range is rarely studied. To this end, we propose that the
   ratios of strains in piezoelectric composites can be active-controlled
   by simultaneously tailoring force and electric fields. The analytical
   solutions for different ratios of strains in piezoelectric composites
   subjected to force and electric fields are presented. It is demonstrated
   that the range of tunable ratios of strains can be from giant negative
   to giant positive. Moreover, the ratios of strains in any location of FG
   piezoelectric composites can be greatly affected by force field,
   electric field, polarization direction, volume fraction of piezoelectric
   phase. The present study may open up a new routine to design materials
   possessing extraordinary and programmable mechanical behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper attempts to make mechanical and permeability characteristics
   of cement bound coals closer to those of undisturbed coals. It uses
   triaxial servo-controlled seepage equipment for thermo-fluid-solid
   coupling of coal containing methane and selects cement as a binder. The
   triaxal compressive properties of cement bound coals with different
   binder ratios are compared with those of undisturbed coals. The
   characteristic values for the mechanical and permeability
   characteristics of the cement bound coals are evaluated quantitatively
   using Euclidean distance based similarity methods. The results show
   that: as binder ratios increase, the peak principal stress difference
   and the elastic modulus of the cement bound coal probably increase
   following a positive exponential function trend. Poisson's ratio
   decreases following a negative exponent function trend. As the binder
   ratio increases, the initial permeability and the minimum permeability
   of the cement bound coal have the decreasing trend of exponent function.
   The penetration rate of change is smaller and smaller. The
   permeability-axial strain curve is gentler. The mechanical and
   permeability characteristics of the cement bound coal with the cement
   binder ratio \# IV are the closest to those of undisturbed coal. This
   type of cement bound coal can be used as the similar material for
   simulating the undisturbed coal.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new type of auxetic material with ultrahigh strength and
   ductility that mimics the crystal structures of two natural solids:
   a-cristobalite and LaNiO3/SrTiO3 superlattice (or ABO(3) perovskite).
   The fabrication method is based on wire-woven metals. Namely, this new
   auxetic material is fabricated by forming helical wires, assembling them
   into a wire-woven structure, and then filling the tetrahedron or
   octahedron cells with another solid. The structure is then transformed
   similar to the crystal structure of one of the two natural auxetic
   solids, mentioned above. We evaluate the mechanical and auxetic
   properties of the material through compression tests on the specimens
   made of aluminum, followed by numerical analyses. Unlike previous
   auxetic materials, this material can be mass produced and can absorb
   ultrahigh energy, needed for heavy duty applications such as a sandwich
   core of military amour, because the raw material is metallic wire and
   the fabrication process is uncomplicated, merely comprising conventional
   metal forming and heat treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of several classes of mechanical metamaterials to induce
   their own overall rotational motion through the individual rotation of
   their subunits is examined. Using a theoretical approach, we confirm
   that for various rotating rigid unit systems, if by design the sum of
   angular momentum of subunits rotating in different directions is made to
   be unequal, then the system will experience an overall rotation, the
   extent of which may be controlled through careful choice of the
   geometric parameters defining these systems. This phenomenon of
   self-induced rotation is also confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, we
   discuss how these systems can be designed in a special way so as to
   permit extended rotations which allows them to overcome geometric
   lockage and the relevance of this concept in applications ranging from
   satellites to spacecraft and telescopes employed in space.}},

Abstract = {{The evaluation of groundwater presence by means of seismic wave
   velocities is of great concern for many hydrological related engineering
   applications. This work introduces a simple basic procedure to
   accurately and systematically identify groundwater levels using P-wave
   and S-wave velocities. This procedure is defined as a seismic
   reflectivity parameter and based on the seismic reflection coefficients
   of P-wave and S-wave at the unsaturated/saturated interfaces (i.e.,
   groundwater level). The present procedure is applied to 1045 K-NET sites
   in Japan. Observed velocity structures, accompanied by their bulk
   densities and detailed lithology, for the upper 20 m depth are obtained
   from the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster
   Prevention, Japan. Calculations are carried out considering three
   distinct lithological conditions - gravel, sand and clay-silt sediments
   - in order to evaluate the ability of this approach (seismic
   reflectivity parameter) to detect the groundwater level and assess its
   practical limitations. The increase of the seismic reflectivity
   parameter value varies substantially with Poisson's ratio, resembling
   the relationship between VP/VS and Poisson's ratio in gravel, sand and
   clay-silt sediments. However, positive seismic reflectivity parameter
   values indicate groundwater presence, whereas negative seismic
   reflectivity parameter values indicate lithological variation. The
   seismic reflectivity parameter can also be used as a relative indicator
   for groundwater saturation levels. Fair comparisons are established
   between the seismic reflectivity parameter and the water seismic index
   technique. However, the seismic reflectivity parameter approach shows
   consistency with previous theoretical and experimental studies related
   to variations of VP and VS in saturated conditions, whereas the water
   seismic index shows inconsistency with these previous theoretical and
   experimental studies and an inability in determining saturation levels
   and detecting groundwater levels.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of lightning-induced forest fires during a time period is
   count data featuring over-dispersion (i.e., variance is larger than
   mean) and a high frequency of zero counts. In this study, we used six
   generalized linear models to examine the relationship between the
   occurrence of lightning-induced forest fires and meteorological factors
   in the Northern Daxing'an Mountains of China. The six models included
   Poisson, negative binomial (NB), zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP),
   zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB), Poisson hurdle (PH), and
   negative binomial hurdle (NBH) models. Goodness-of-fit was compared and
   tested among the six models using Akaike information criterion (AIC),
   sum of squared errors, likelihood ratio test, and Vuong test. The
   predictive performance of the models was assessed and compared using
   independent validation data by the data-splitting method. Based on the
   model AIC, the ZINB model best fitted the fire occurrence data, followed
   by (in order of smaller AIC) NBH, ZIP, NB, PH, and Poisson models. The
   ZINB model was also best for predicting either zero counts or positive
   counts (a parts per thousand yen1). The two Hurdle models (PH and NBH)
   were better than ZIP, Poisson, and NB models for predicting positive
   counts, but worse than these three models for predicting zero counts.
   Thus, the ZINB model was the first choice for modeling the occurrence of
   lightning-induced forest fires in this study, which implied that the
   excessive zero counts of lightning-induced fires came from both
   structure and sampling zeros.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic cellular tubes are emerging as potential candidates for a number

   collapse under pure bending of auxetic tubes based on inverted hexagonal

   improving their kinking response. First, the mechanical properties of
   the structure are determined under small deformation by means of
   analytical approaches, and used to verify the validity of numerical
   models. These are then used to simulate the tube collapse under pure
   bending, and identify the influence of the geometric parameters defining
   the structure on the phenomenon. The study indicates that the adoption
   of auxetic tubular structures can contribute to improving considerably
   the resistance to kinking, suggesting the parameters to be controlled in

Abstract = {{A symmetry-extended Maxwell treatment of the net mobility of periodic

   4, or 3. If the reducible representation for the net mobility contains
   mechanisms that preserve full rotational symmetry (A modes), these are
   equiauxetic. In addition, for n = 6, mechanisms that halve rotational

Abstract = {{A single grain can contract or expand in the transverse direction when
   it is stretched. It becomes complex when the single grain is embedded in
   a stretched polycrystal, due to the grain neighborhood effect, which can
   outweigh the lateral contraction/expansion of that grain itself. Here,
   we performed numerical simulations to elucidate such grain-to-grain
   interaction effects on the lattice strain behavior. For individual
   grains in a polycrystal, pseudo Poisson's ratio is defined. Ratios of
   Poisson's ratio over pseudo Poisson's ratio were employed to indicate
   the difference between the cases of the grain deformation with and
   without the constraint imposed from the neighboring grains. The
   high-stress spots and the sense of the stress components can be
   identified with a high possibility according to the proposed ratios.
   Most of the identified high-stress spots feature tensile stresses in
   three directions, while some of them feature the compressive stress in
   one transverse direction and a negative Poisson's ratio. For the latter,
   a strong grain-to-grain interaction during the plastic stage of
   deformation is found. These grains induce the reversal of the lattice
   strain evolution curve for the measured < 002 >//TD, which is often
   found in the literature and in the data of neutron diffraction.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the high pressure studies of well known

   functional theory calculations. We reproduce the experimental alpha and

   (from alpha to gamma) of this material to be approximate to 26 kbar. Our
   calculated positional and axial parameters are in an excellent agreement
   with the available experimental values for the both alpha and gamma
   phases of this material. Then we study the mechanical properties of this
   material. We calculate the elastic constants, bulk, shear and Young's
   moduli, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature of alpha-ZrW2O8. In our
   study, we find that the generalized gradient approximation method fails
   to obtain the correct values while the local density approximation (LDA)
   method successfully reproduces the experimental bulk modulus of ZrW2O8.
   Our calculated values of the shear and Young's moduli, Poisson's ratio,

   results of modeling special cases of exploration interest having
   positive reflectivity, near-zero reflectivity, and negative
   reflectivity.
   The AVO reflectivity in anisotropic media can be decomposed into two
   parts; one for isotropy and the other for anisotropy. Zero-offset
   reflectivity and Poisson' s ratio contrast are the most significant
   parameters for the isotropic component while the delta difference
   (DELTAdelta) between shale and gas sand is the most important factor for
   the anisotropic component. For typical values of TI anisotropy in shale
   (positive delta and epsilon), both delta difference (DELTAdelta) and
   epsilon difference (DELTAepsilon) amplify AVO effects. For small angles
   of incidence, DELTAdelta plays an important role in AVO while
   DELTAepsilon dominates for large angles of incidence.
   For typical values of delta and epsilon, the effects of anisotropy in
   shale are: (1) a more rapid increase in AVO for Class 3 and Class 2 gas
   sands, (2) a more rapid decrease in AVO for Class 1 gas sands, and (3) a
   shift in the offset of polarity reversal for some Class 1 and Class 2
   gas sands.}},

Abstract = {{A calculation model has been developed for large-strain radial
   consolidation incorporating lateral deformation in order to solve the
   problem of poor consolidation prediction for dredged sludge at high
   water content in vacuum preloading process. The differential solution
   for the proposed model is given, considering the effect of initial water
   content on the compression behavior. The model is suitable for
   unconsolidated soil and normally consolidated soil, which can take into
   account such factors as lateral deformation, varying compressibility and
   permeability coefficients, smearing effect, self-weight stress, negative
   pressure attenuation along the depth, etc. The proposed model is
   verified by comparing it with other existing theoretical solutions.
   Poisson's ratio (v) is used to reflect the influence of lateral
   deformation on soil consolidation. The results show that lateral
   deformation has an important influence on soil consolidation degree,
   especially on consolidation degree defined by stress (U-p). The
   consolidation rate increases with the increase of v. The traditional
   equal-strain solution overestimates the consolidation rate of
   foundation. At the same normalized elevation, the void ratio increases
   while the excess pore water pressure decreases with the increase of v.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, sandwich plates with flexible core and composite surfaces
   as well as viscoelastic and auxetic core are investigated under dynamic
   loading. A new higher order global-local theory is used for simulation
   of the dynamic behavior of sandwich plates. The presented theory is able
   to consider the thickness change of the sandwich plates as well as
   transverse stresses accurately. It is obvious that considering these
   parameters are so crucial in study behavior of thick sandwich plates or
   sandwich plates with soft core. Furthermore, in terms of solving
   equations, an iterative incremental method based on the formulation of
   transient nonlinear finite element as well as a real time algorithm was
   employed to simulate viscoelastic behavior accurately. The results
   indicate a significant increase in the stiffness of the sandwich plate
   due to the auxetic properties of the core materials, leading
   consequently to the reduction of the vibration amplitude and stresses
   level. Some of the innovations belonging to this paper are: 1)
   presenting a global-local higher-order theory while considering the
   changes in the thickness of the sandwich plates; 2) calculating
   transverse stresses using the three-dimensional elasticity method as
   well as modifying the results obtained from displacement and inertial
   effects based on this method; 3) simulating sandwich plate with
   viscoelastic and auxetic cores; 4) taking orthotropic properties for the
   viscoelastic core into account.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the vibration transmissibility behavior of novel dome
   shaped auxetic structures with different cellular configurations are
   numerically simulated and subsequently studied experimentally. The
   dynamic behavior of domes with honeycomb and auxetic structures are
   studied within the frequency bandwidth of 5-500 Hz by using base
   excitation technique. The auxetic samples are subjected to broadband
   excitation at low dynamic strain, followed by sine sweep around the
   resonance of the system. The dynamic and modal behaviors are
   experimentally analyzed by using 3D Laser Doppler Vibrometer. The system
   is shown to develop specific wave propagation and attenuation bands,
   outline of which is important for developing strategies for
   damping/energy harvesting. Further, analysis has been carried out to
   analyze the mechanical wave propagation behavior when the system is
   subjected to broadband excitation frequency at low dynamic strains.
   Here, we have arranged a large periodic repeating units of double-dome
   shape auxetics with lumped mass inside it placed in the form of metal
   ring. The equivalent spring-mass-damper mechanical circuit has been
   developed simplifying our system. The Nonlinear stiffness of double-dome
   structure depend upon constitutive cellular cells i.e. auxetic, regular
   honeycomb and plane, which is evident for getting broader bandgap
   formation than the linear one. The lumped mass is considered here as
   locally resonating metamaterial enabling low-frequency vibration
   attenuation. Furthermore, the analysis is being done for bandgap
   expressions depending upon the added mass ratio and target frequency.
   Further study is proposed for attenuation and transmission band analysis
   to steer the waves which roots the idea of vibration sink, in which we
   can damp the mechanical waves effectively at a specific location. The
   Auxetic meta-materials are envisaged to have a significant role in wave
   attenuation and wave steering, and can be used effectively for vibration
   control.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter explores the stress wave transmission and reflection from
   an incident stress wave, between isotropic solids of different Poisson's
   ratio, with special emphasis on systems in which at least one of the
   solids is auxetic. The dimensionless transmitted stress, in terms of the
   ratio of transmitted to incident stresses, were investigated for
   longitudinal stresses in prismatic bars (1D stress), longitudinal
   stresses in width-constrained plates (2D stress or 2D strain), plane
   waves of dilatation (1D strain), torsional waves (shear waves), and
   Rayleigh (surface) waves. Each of these wave transmission study was
   performed under three special cases, i.e. when the (i) product of
   density and Young's modulus for both solids are equal, (ii) product of
   density and shear modulus for both solids are equal, and (iii) product
   of density and bulk modulus for both solids are equal. Under these
   special conditions, results show that the stress transmission is
   effectively doubled or eliminated when the Poisson's ratio for the
   isotropic solids are at their limits.}},

Abstract = {{The Brillouin light-scattering technique was used to investigate the
   single-crystal elastic properties of two aluminosilicate zeolites,
   natrolite (NAT) and analcime (ANA), at ambient conditions. An inversion
   of the acoustic velocity data results in the full set of elastic
   stiffness moduli (C-ij's) for both materials. From the single-crystal
   moduli the aggregate adiabatic bulk moduli (K-s), shear moduli (G), and
   Poisson's ratios (nu) were found to be K-s=48.5(1.0) GPa, G=31.6(1.0)
   GPa, and nu=0.232(5) for NAT, and K-s=59.8(1.2) GPa, G=32.1(1.0) GPa,
   and nu=0.272(5) for ANA (Voigt-Reuss-Hill averages). The bulk and shear
   moduli of both zeolites are relatively low compared with those of
   densely packed aluminosilicates, reflecting an open framework structure

Abstract = {{We employed a combination of theoretical and experimental techniques to
   study the metal-organic framework (MOF)-mechanics central to the
   paddle-wheel Cu-3(BTC)(2) porous structure, commonly designated as
   HKUST-1. Lattice dynamics of the hybrid framework at below 18 THz were
   measured by means of Raman and synchrotron far-infrared spectroscopy,
   and systematically correlated to collective vibrational modes computed
   from ab initio density functional theory (DFT). We have identified a
   number of intriguing lowenergy framework vibration mechanisms,
   reminiscent of the `trampoline-like' deformations and new oscillatory
   motions associated with Cu paddle-wheel `molecular rotors'. The three
   independent single-crystal elastic constants of the HKUST-1 (i.e. C-11,
   C-12 and C-44) were calculated using the DFT approach, taking into
   account the effects of dispersion corrections. We established the full
   elasticity solutions accompanying detailed deformation mechanisms that
   control its anisotropic mechanical properties, ranging from the Young's
   and shear moduli to linear compressibility and Poisson's ratio. Our
   results support the notion that the co-existance of soft modes and
   intrinsic shear distortions connected to the THz lattice dynamics
   dictate a range of anomalous elastic phenomena, for example: negative
   Poisson's ratio (auxeticity), negative thermal expansion (NTE), and
   exceedingly low shear moduli properties.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate the deformation mechanism of auxetic
   hierarchical rotating square systems through a dynamics approach. We
   show how their deformation behaviour, hence their mechanical properties
   and final configuration for a given applied load, can be manipulated
   solely by altering the resistance to rotational motion of the hinges
   within the system. This provides enhanced tunability without necessarily
   changing the geometry of the system, a phenomenon which is not typically
   observed in other non-hierarchical unimode auxetic systems. This gives
   this hierarchical system increased versatility and tunability thus
   making it more amenable to be employed in practical application which
   may range from smart filtration to smart dressings.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we present and review equations which describe the
   evolutionary behavior of double and triple porosity elastic materials.
   Uniqueness and continuous dependence results are described for a double
   porosity anisotropic elastic body when the elastic coefficients are
   positive, in a precise sense. We then review work on uniqueness and
   continuous dependence when the elastic coefficients are not required to
   be sign definite. With the advent of auxetic materials, and other
   materials which have negative Poisson ratios, sign indefinite elastic
   coefficients are important. We further establish uniqueness for a double
   porosity elastic body which occupies an unbounded spatial domain. This
   is not a trivial extension from the bounded domain case since the
   pressures and deformation and their derivatives are allowed to have
   substantial growth in space at infinity and so classical techniques like
   the energy method fail. After this we review work on acceleration wave
   evolution in a linear elastic double porosity body and then in a
   nonlinear elastic one. For the linear elastic double porosity problem,
   it is seen that the amplitude of the acceleration wave will decay
   exponentially in time. In the nonlinear case, however, we see that
   shocks may develop in a finite time. Finally, we present models for the
   evolutionary behavior of a triple porosity linearly elastic body.}},

Abstract = {{Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) self-renew in a state of naive pluripotency
   in which they are competent to generate all somatic cells. It has been
   hypothesized that, before irreversibly committing, ESCs pass through at
   least one metastable transition state. This transition would represent a
   gateway for differentiation and reprogramming of somatic cells. Here, we
   show that during the transition, the nuclei of ESCs are auxetic: they
   exhibit a cross-sectional expansion when stretched and a cross-sectional
   contraction when compressed, and their stiffness increases under
   compression. We also show that the auxetic phenotype of transition ESC
   nuclei is driven at least in part by global chromatin decondensation.
   Through the regulation of molecular turnover in the differentiating
   nucleus by external forces, auxeticity could be a key element in
   mechanotransduction. Our findings highlight the importance of nuclear
   structure in the regulation of differentiation and reprogramming.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the finite element analysis of an innovative 3D
   auxetic textile structure consisting of three yarn systems (weft, warp
   and stitch yarns). Different from conventional 3D textile structures,
   the proposed structure exhibits an auxetic behaviour under compression
   and can be used as a reinforcement to manufacture auxetic composites.
   The geometry of the structure is first described. Then a 3D finite
   element model is established using ANSYS software and validated by the
   experimental results. The deformation process of the structure at
   different compression strains is demonstrated, and the validated finite
   element model is finally used to simulate the auxetic behaviour of the
   structure with different structural parameters and yarn properties. The
   results show that the auxetic behaviour of the proposed structure
   increases with increasing compression strain, and all the structural
   parameters and yarn properties have significant effects on the auxetic
   behaviour of the structure. It is expected that the study could provide
   a better understanding of 3D auxetic textile structures and could
   promote their application in auxetic composites.}},

Abstract = {{Auxeticity of materials improves several of their mechanical properties,
   especially shear, impact, and bending resistance. It also improves
   ability of materials to absorb impact energy as well as the overall
   stiffness of structures. In this research, authors examine synclastic
   panels made from novel wood-based composites. The aim is to determine
   the force-displacement characteristics during uniaxial compression and
   obtain the stiffness of the panels. These data allow one to predict the
   behavior of a panel during two-axial bending with different support
   scenarios. Finite element method (FEM) analysis is performed, with the
   use of model material, to determine the impact of varied facings
   thickness as well as different types of materials and core structures,
   on the stiffness of synclastic panels. It is demonstrated that proposed
   multilayer composites allow forming (technologically difficult)
   spherical shapes, without additional heat and pressure treatment. The
   type of an outer layer material strictly determines the usability and
   ease of two-axial bending process. Presented composites are interesting
   materials, that can be adopted into the wood industry as a replacement
   for traditional materials, e.g., bent plywood.}},

Abstract = {{Dependence of relaxor behavior of incompletely filled tetragonal
   tungsten bronze uniaxial relaxor ferroelectric calcium barium niobate
   (CaxBa1-xNb2O6, CBN-x) on its composition was investigated by varying
   Ca/Ba ratio (0.18 <= x <= 0.35) and studying its thermal and elastic
   properties. Recently, we have reported the relaxor behavior CBN-28 with
   the evidence of the existence of the Burns temperature T-B, and the
   intermediate characteristic temperature T{*} {[}Pandey et al., Phys.
   Rev. B 84, 174102 (2011)]. In this work, we show that the dynamics of
   polar nanoregions (and hence the relaxor behavior) strongly varies with
   the Ca/Ba ratio. Evidence is found for a more pronounced relaxor
   behavior with increasing x. The Curie temperature and the Burns
   temperature are also very sensitive to the composition, whereas the
   characteristic temperature T{*} appears unaffected from the Ca/Ba ratio.
   The bonding interaction has been explained on the basis of bulk modulus,
   Poisson's ratio, and deviation from Cauchy relations. Presented results
   open the perspective to understand the variation of relaxor behavior of
   CBN-x (similar to 0.18 <= x <= similar to 0.35) above Curie temperature.

Abstract = {{Metallic aerogels have attracted intense attention due to their superior
   properties, such as high electrical conductivity, ultralow densities,
   and large specific surface area. The preparation of metal aerogels with
   high efficiency and controllability remains challenge. A 3D freeze
   assembling printing technique integrated with drop-on-demand inkjet
   printing and freeze casting are proposed for metallic aerogels
   preparation. This technique enables tailoring both the macrostructure
   and microstructure of silver nanowire aerogels (SNWAs) by integrating
   programmable 3D printing and freeze casting, respectively. The density
   of the printed SNWAs is controllable, which can be down to 1.3 mg
   cm(-3). The ultralight SNWAs reach high electrical conductivity of 1.3 S
   cm(-1) and exhibit excellent compressive resilience under 50\%
   compressive strain. Remarkably, the printing methodology also enables
   tuning aerogel architectures with designed Poisson's ratio (from
   negative to positive). Moreover, these aerogel architechtures with
   tunable Poisson's ratio present highly electromechanical stability under
   high compressive and tensile strain (both strain up to 20\% with fully
   recovery).}},

Abstract = {{The derivation of the effective mechanical properties of planar lattices
   made of articulated bars is herewith investigated, relying on the
   asymptotic homogenization technique to get closed form expressions of
   the equivalent properties versus the geometrical and mechanical
   microparameters. Considering lattice microrotations as additional
   degrees of freedom at both scales, micropolar equivalent continua are
   constructed from discrete lattices made of a repetitive unit cell, from
   an extension of the asymptotic homogenization technique. We will show
   that it is necessary to solve on two different orders a linear system of
   equations giving the kinematic variables, at both the first and second
   order. The effective strain and effective curvature appear respectively
   as the first and second order strain variables. In the case of a
   centrosymmetric unit cell, there is no coupling between couple stresses
   and strains nor between stress and curvature. The unknown kinematic
   variables are determined by solving the translational and rotational
   equilibrium for the whole lattice. This in turn leads to the expression
   of the stress vector and couple stress vector, allowing to construct the
   Cauchy stress and couple stress tensors. The homogenized behavior of the
   tetragonal and hexagonal lattices is determined in terms of homogenized
   micropolar moduli.}},

   order to examine variations in the processed material's inner structure,
   samples from different locations of the specimen were scanned. Moreover,
   a foam specimen was divided into nine subspecimens to perform a set of
   static tests on each of them separately and to check the gradient of
   properties throughout the sample volume. Presented methods allowed to

Abstract = {{The paper investigates the wave propagation characteristics of periodic
   two dimensional, auxetic lattice structures. Periodic structures in
   general feature unique wave propagation characteristics, whereby waves
   are allowed to propagate only within specific frequency bands. Two
   dimensional periodic structures complement this feature with a low
   frequency directional behavior. The combination of these unique
   characteristics makes two dimensional periodic structures ideal
   candidates for the design of pass-band directional mechanical filters.
   Focus is here placed on honeycomb lattice configurations. A sensitivity
   analysis is first presented to investigate the influence of band-gap and
   directional behaviors with respect to changes in the internal angle. The
   presented results demonstrate how re-entrant topologies feature enhanced
   wave attenuation capabilities with respect to hexagonal lay-outs. An
   optimization problem is then formulated by considering the internal
   angle as a design variable, and the width of the attenuation frequency
   ranges and angular range of propagation at low frequencies as objective
   functions. The identified optimal configurations feature combined
   properties which demonstrate the effectiveness of the analysis
   procedure. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH F Co. KGaA, Weinheim.}},

Abstract = {{Ionogels are an emerging class of soft materials that exhibit ionic
   conductivity and thermal stability without the need to replenish ions or
   the addition of conductive particle fillers. An ionogel ink is reported
   for direct-write 3D printing to fabricate conductive structures that can
   vary in the printed object geometries. This approach relies on a
   shear-thinning ionogel ink that can be extruded to afford
   self-supporting constructs. After a brief UV cure, the printed construct
   is transformed into a mechanically tough, transparent structure that is
   ionically conductive. Upon application of stretching and twisting loads,
   the 3D-printed objects exhibit detectable changes in conductivity. To
   demonstrate the versatility of rapid prototyping with the ionogel inks,
   an auxetic structure is 3D printed and tested as a strain sensor. The
   printed auxetic structure exhibits an electrical response to strain, but
   also demonstrates increased extensibility and operational range in
   comparison to a casted bulk film with the same outer dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{The wave propagation through a material with a granular microstructure
   is investigated. The simplest such medium is the granular, medium of
   equal spheres. The theory demonstrates that for long wavelengths the
   micro-structured material exhibits modes of wave motion that are also
   found for a traditional medium (that is, a medium that satisfies simple
   continuum stress equilibrium laws and no consideration for particle spin
   and moment of inertia of the particles is accounted for). However an
   extra shear wave and rotational oscillatory particle motion are also
   found. The limit of a traditional material is obtained by letting
   tangential contact stiffnesses vanish. Towards higher wave number the
   micro-structure reveals itself in the shear wave speeds by displaying
   strongly anomalous behaviour compared to traditional isotropic-elastic
   medium. An expansion in terms of structural sums (these are sums over
   the contact interaction weighed with a string of branch vectors) is
   explored. The lowest order non-trivial terms (second order structural
   sums) yield basic behaviour, but a higher order expansion (including
   fourth order sums) shows a more pronounced anomaly for wave numbers
   approaching the inverse particle diameter. Yet higher order terms
   capture more information than can possibly be present in a granular
   medium and it is senseless to examine these. The theory is relevant to
   granular materials and granular auxetics. In the latter case the
   tangential contact stiffness needs to exceed the normal stiffness, which
   is not possible for ordinary solid contacts, but can be achieved with
   special arrangements. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

   incorporates influence of the auxeticity (negative Poisson ratio) of the
   material into elastic responses of the variable thickness functionally
   graded conical and cylindrical shells and circular/annular plates is

   to general non-uniform normal and shear tractions. The mentioned
   material and loading complexities have not been investigated before and
   consequently, the presented comprehensive results are quite new. The
   proposed unified formulation is developed using the principle of minimum
   total potential energy and solved using Taylor's transform, for some
   combinations of the simply supported, clamped and free edge conditions.
   Accuracy of results of the proposed unified solution is verified by
   results of the three-dimensional theory of elasticity extracted from the
   ABAQUS finite element analysis code. Finally, a comprehensive parametric
   study including evaluation of individual/simultaneous effects of the
   auxeticity, structure configuration, shear/normal traction, thickness

Pages = {{8198-8202}},
Abstract = {{Most materials have a unique form optimized for a specific property and
   function. However, the ability to reconfigure material structures
   depending on stimuli opens exciting opportunities. Although mechanical
   instabilities have been traditionally viewed as a failure mode, here we
   exploit them to design a class of 2D soft materials whose architecture
   can be dramatically changed in response to an external stimulus. By
   considering geometric constraints on the tessellations of the 2D
   Euclidean plane, we have identified four possible periodic distributions
   of uniform circular holes where mechanical instability can be exploited
   to reversibly switch between expanded (i.e. with circular holes) and
   compact (i.e. with elongated, almost closed elliptical holes) periodic
   configurations. Interestingly, in all these structures buckling is found
   to induce large negative values of incremental Poisson's ratio and in
   two of them also the formation of chiral patterns. Using a combination
   of finite element simulations and experiments at the centimeter scale we
   demonstrate a proof-of-concept of the proposed materials. Since the
   proposed mechanism for reconfigurable materials is induced by elastic
   instability, it is reversible, repeatable and scale-independent.}},

Abstract = {{Observations in many applications consist of counts of discrete events,
   such as photons hitting a detector, which cannot be effectively modeled
   using an additive bounded or Gaussian noise model, and instead require a
   Poisson noise model. As a result, accurate reconstruction of a spatially
   or temporally distributed phenomenon (f(star)) from Poisson data (y)
   cannot be effectively accomplished by minimizing a conventional
   penalized least-squares objective function. The problem addressed in
   this paper is the estimation of f(star) from in an inverse problem
   setting, where the number of unknowns may potentially be larger than the
   number of observations and f(star) admits sparse approximation. The
   optimization formulation considered in this paper uses a penalized
   negative Poisson log-likelihood objective function with nonnegativity
   constraints (since Poisson intensities are naturally nonnegative). In
   particular, the proposed approach incorporates key ideas of using
   separable quadratic approximations to the objective function at each
   iteration and penalization terms related to l(1) norms of coefficient
   vectors, total variation seminorms, and partition-based multiscale
   estimation methods.}},

Abstract = {{We present a computational method for interactive 3D design and
   rationalization of surfaces via auxetic materials, i.e., flat flexible
   material that can stretch uniformly up to a certain extent. A key
   motivation for studying such material is that one can approximate
   doubly-curved surfaces (such as the sphere) using only flat pieces,
   making it attractive for fabrication. We physically realize surfaces by
   introducing cuts into approximately inextensible material such as sheet
   metal, plastic, or leather. The cutting pattern is modeled as a regular
   triangular linkage that yields hexagonal openings of spatially-varying
   radius when stretched. In the same way that isometry is fundamental to
   modeling developable surfaces, we leverage conformal geometry to
   understand auxetic design. In particular, we compute a global conformal
   map with bounded scale factor to initialize an otherwise intractable
   non-linear optimization. We demonstrate that this global approach can
   handle non-trivial topology and non-local dependencies inherent in
   auxetic material. Design studies and physical prototypes are used to
   illustrate a wide range of possible applications.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials with extraordinary material properties, not easily found
   in nature, are of great interest. In this paper, the authors employ
   topology optimization with a reconciled level set method in order to
   design 3D negative Poisson's ratio designs. The strain energy method has
   been used to predict the effective properties of the periodically
   assembled metamaterial, which is based on the resulted unit cell. The
   sensitivity analysis is derived utilizing the adjoint variable method
   with the general linear elastic equation combined with a weak imposition
   of the Dirichlet boundary condition. 3D single-material and multi
   material designs have been generated showing the effectiveness of the

Abstract = {{Equilibrium response of articular cartilage to indentation loading is
   controlled by the thickness (h) and elastic properties (shear modulus,
   mu, and Poisson's ratio, nu) of the tissue. In this study, we
   characterized topographical variation of Poisson's ratio of the
   articular cartilage in the canine knee joint (N = 6), Poisson's ratio
   was measured using a microscopic technique. In this technique, the shape
   change of the cartilage disk was visualized while the cartilage was
   immersed in physiological solution and compressed in unconfined
   geometry. After a constant 5\% axial strain, the lateral strain was
   measured during stress relaxation. At equilibrium, the lateral-to-axial
   strain ratio indicates the Poisson's ratio of the tissue, Indentation
   (equilibrium) data from our prior study (Arokoski et al., 1994,
   International Journal of Sports Medicine 15, 254-260) was re-analyzed
   using the Poisson's ratio results at the test site to derive values for
   shear and aggregate moduli, The lowest Poisson's ratio (0.070 +/- 0.016)
   located at the patellar surface of femur (FPI) and the highest (0.236
   +/- 0.026) at the medial tibial plateau (TMI). The stiffest cartilage
   was found at the patellar groove of femur (mu = 0.964 +/- 0.189 MPa, H-a
   = 2.084 +/- 0.409 MPa) and the softest at the tibial plateaus (mu =
   0.385 +/- 0.062 MPa, H-a = 1.113 +/- 0.141 MPa), Comparison of the
   mechanical results and the biochemical composition of the tissue
   (Jurvelin et al,, 1988. Engineering in Medicine 17, 157-162) at the
   matched sites of the canine knee joint indicated a negative correlation
   between the Poisson's ratio and collagen-to-PG content ratio. This is in
   harmony with our previous findings which suggested that, in unconfined
   compression, the degree of lateral expansion in different tissue zones
   is related to collagen-to-PC ratio of the zone. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The researched polyisocyanurate foam FENIX is an innovative expanded
   structural material constituted of fine open cells suitable for
   transports, aeronautics, marine industries and for all those areas that
   require materials with strong fire reaction. In the paper the FENIX foam
   behaviour during quasi-static compression tests was examined. The
   experimental research was carried out with the use of the material
   testing stage which is an integral part of the microtomograph Skyscan
   1147. The very interesting phenomenon was observed during experiment.
   Both types of researched foam showed an auxetic behaviour - the samples
   collapsed inside their volume, what resulted in their negative Poisson's
   ratios.
   The next step of such material structure research was its microstrutural
   model development. The model was based on the well known Kelvin geometry
   and solid eight-node elements. The aim of the numerical study was to
   examine if the dimension of the sample influence its auxetic or
   non-auxetic behaviour. For that purpose three models built of 3 x 3 x 3,
   3 x 3 x 6 and 3 x 3 x 9 cells were prepared and subjected to the
   compression load. Numerical analyses were carried out with the use of
   LS-Dyna computer code. Material characteristics and model for solid
   polyisocyanurate were chosen on the base of literature studies. The
   strain-stress results of numerical analyses were compared to the
   experiment with good accordance. The deformations were then examined.
   The samples showed an auxetic behaviour only for the 3 x 3 x 3 cells
   model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{CPU time and memory usage are two vital issues that any numerical
   solvers for the Poisson-Boltzmann equation have to face in biomolecular
   applications. In this study, we systematically analyzed the CPU time and
   memory usage of five commonly used finite-difference solvers with a
   large and diversified set of biomolecular structures. Our comparative
   analysis shows that modified incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient and
   geometric multigrid are the most efficient in the diversified test set.
   For the two efficient solvers, our test shows that their CPU times
   increase approximately linearly with the numbers of grids. Their CPU
   times also increase almost linearly with the negative logarithm of the
   convergence criterion at very similar rate. Our comparison further shows
   that geometric multigrid performs better in the large set of tested
   biomolecules. However, modified incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient
   is superior to geometric multigrid in molecular dynamics simulations of
   tested molecules. We also investigated other significant components in
   numerical solutions of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. It turns out that
   the time-limiting step is the free boundary condition setup or the
   linear systems for the selected proteins if the electrostatic focusing
   is not used. Thus, development of future numerical solvers for the
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation should balance all aspects of the numerical
   procedures in realistic biomolecular applications. (C) 2010 Wiley

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},

Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{123-130}},
Month = {{AUG 16}},
Abstract = {{There are two polar contemporary approaches to the constitutive modeling
   of arterial wall with anisotropy induced by collagen fibers. The first
   one is based on the angular integration (AI) of the strain energy on a
   unit sphere for the analytically defined fiber dispersion. The second
   one is based on the introduction of the generalized structure tensors
   (GST). AI approach is very involved computationally while GST approach
   requires somewhat complicated procedure for the exclusion of compressed
   fibers.
   We present some middle ground models, which are based on the use of 16
   and 8 structure tensors. These models are moderately involved
   computationally and they allow excluding compressed fibers easily. We
   use the proposed models to study the role of the fiber dispersion in the
   constitutive modeling of the arterial wall. Particularly, we study the
   auxetic effect which can appear in anisotropic materials. The effect
   means thickening of the tissue in the direction perpendicular to its
   stretching. Such an effect was not observed in experiments while some
   simple anisotropic models do predict it. We show that more accurate
   account of the fiber dispersion suppresses the auxetic effect in a
   qualitative agreement with experimental observations. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this work, it is shown experimentally for the first time that chiral
   mechanical metamaterials can induce their own global rotational motion,
   i.e. the rotation of the entire system with respect to its centre of
   mass, without any external forces acting on it. To better understand
   this effect, which is very different from other types of deformations
   studied in the literature and offers an insight into what aspects of
   dynamic behaviour of mechanical metamaterials are yet to be discovered,
   a number of different prototypes of chiral systems are analysed where it
   is shown what type of a design allows to maximise the extent of the
   exhibited rotation. In addition to this, the theoretical model
   corresponding to computer simulations utilising the Molecular Dynamics
   approach is proposed and used to establish the hypothetical limit of the
   considered phenomenon. It is also discussed what are the parameters that
   can be used in order to fine-tune the extent of the global rotation
   exhibited by chiral systems. Finally, it is discussed that the concept
   studied in this work can be used in numerous applications such as
   satellites, spacecraft, telescopes employed in space as well as novel
   robotics to control their global rotational motion.}},

Abstract = {{We examine solid cellular structures within the theoretical framework of
   finite elasticity, whereby we assume that the cell wall material is
   nonlinear elastic. This enables us to identify new mechanical effects
   that appear in cellular materials when elastically deformed, and to
   explore the physical properties that influence them. We find that, when
   a honeycomb structure of hyperelastic material and standard geometry,
   such as rectangular-, hexagonal- or diamond-shaped cells, contains walls
   which are inclined relative to an applied uniaxial tensile load, these
   walls tend to expand both in the direction of the load and in the
   perpendicular direction, producing an apparent negative Poisson's ratio
   at local cell level. Moreover, we show that this (negative) Poisson
   ratio decreases as the magnitude of the tensile load increases. For
   these structures, Poisson's ratios greater than 0.5 are obtained in
   uniaxial compression. Similar effects in structures with linearly
   elastic cell walls do not occur.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In assisted reproductive technology, it is important to
   choose high quality embryos for embryo transfer. The aim of the present
   study was to determine the grade A embryo count and factors related to
   it in infertile women.
   Materials and Methods: This historical cohort study included 996
   infertile women. The main outcome was the number of grade A embryos.
   Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression and Zero-Inflated Negative
   Binomial (ZINB) regression were used to model the count data as it
   contained excessive zeros. Stata software, version 13 (Stata Corp,
   College Station, TX, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.
   Results: After adjusting for potential confounders, results from the
   ZINB model show that for each unit increase in the number 2 pronuclear
   (2PN) zygotes, we get an increase of 1.45 times as incidence rate ratio
   (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.23-1.69, P=0.001) in the expected
   grade A embryo count number, and for each increase in the cleavage day
   we get a decrease 0.35 times (95\% CI: 0.20-0.61, P=0.001) in expected
   grade A embryo count.
   Conclusion: There is a significant association between both the number
   of 2PN zygotes and cleavage day with the number of grade A embryos in
   both ZINB and ZIP regression models. The estimated coefficients are more
   plausible than values found in earlier studies using less relevant
   models.}},

Abstract = {{A common technique used for the calibration of collision prediction
   models is the Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM) procedure with the
   assumption of Negative Binomial or Poisson error distribution. In this
   technique, fixed coefficients that represent the average relationship
   between the dependent variable and each explanatory variable are
   estimated. However, the stationary relationship assumed may hide some
   important spatial factors of the number of collisions at a particular
   traffic analysis zone. Consequently, the accuracy of such models for
   explaining the relationship between the dependent variable and the
   explanatory variables may be suspected since collision frequency is
   likely influenced by many spatially defined factors such as land use,
   demographic characteristics, and traffic volume patterns. The primary
   objective of this study is to investigate the spatial variations in the
   relationship between the number of zonal collisions and potential
   transportation planning predictors, using the Geographically Weighted
   Poisson Regression modeling technique. The secondary objective is to
   build on knowledge comparing the accuracy of Geographically Weighted
   Poisson Regression models to that of Generalized Linear Models. The
   results show that the Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression models
   are useful for capturing spatially dependent relationships and generally
   perform better than the conventional Generalized Linear Models. (C) 2009

   our results also suggest that borophene can react easily with H-2, O-2
   and N-2 when exposed to these molecules. We find that the mechanical
   properties of borophene are remarkably degraded by these defects. The
   anisotropy in Poisson's ratio, however, can be tuned by some of them.
   Furthermore, the adsorbed H or substitutional C may induce remarkably
   negative Poisson's ratio in borophene, and the substitutional C or N can
   significantly increase the Poisson's ratio by contrast.}},

Title = {{Simulation and analysis of coal seam conditions on the stress
   disturbance effects of pulsating hydro-fracturing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Pages = {{649-658}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Pulsating hydro-fracturing (PHF) of coal beds is a technology based on
   conventional hydraulic fracturing and pulsating injection that is
   currently under development and that has found new applications in
   China. However, few studies have considered the geological conditions
   applicable to PHF. Based on continuum mechanics, this paper presents a
   numerical stress-disturbance model to simulate the formation stress
   response during PHF by applying the staggered-grid finite-difference
   scheme. According to the maximum tensile stress criterion, ``the
   effective stress disturbance zone{''} was introduced as the measurement
   criterion of PHF effects. The variations of PHF effects under different
   coal seam conditions (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and horizontal in
   situ stress) were investigated, and several unique behaviors were found.
   First, the coal seam with a lower Young's modulus and higher Poisson's
   ratio will create a larger effective stress disturbance zone. Second,
   the influence of the lower Young's modulus and higher Poisson's ratio
   can be uniformly attributed to the better compressibility of coal rock,
   which will have greater shear stress to expand the disturbance zone.
   Third, a negative correlation exists between the effective stress
   disturbance zone and horizontal in situ stress, among which the minimum
   in situ stress plays a leading role. Finally, the minimum in situ stress
   has the most significant impact on these PHF effects, followed by the
   Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and maximum in situ stress. Therefore,
   the minimum in situ stress condition should be considered first during
   PHF, followed by the rock compressibility. These research results will
   provide guidance for the optimization of coal seams conditions for PHF.

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2011}},
Number = {{2241}},
Pages = {{59-67}},
Abstract = {{The Poisson-gamma (negative binomial or NB) distribution is still the
   most common probabilistic distribution used by transportation safety
   analysts to model motor vehicle crashes. Recent studies have shown that
   the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) distribution also is promising
   for developing crash prediction models. The objectives of this study
   were to investigate and compare the estimation of crash variance
   predicted by the COM-Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) and the
   traditional NB model. The comparison analysis was carried out with the
   most commonly employed functional forms, which linked crashes to the
   entering flows and other explanatory variables at intersections or on
   segments. To accomplish the objectives of the study, several NB and
   COM-Poisson GLMs (including flow-only models and models with several
   covariates) were developed and compared by using two data sets. The
   first data set contained crash data collected at signalized, four-legged
   intersections in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The second data set included
   data collected on rural, four-lane, undivided highways in Texas. The
   results of this study show that the trend of crash variance prediction
   by COM-Poisson GLM is similar to that predicted by the NB model. The
   Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between the crash variance
   predicted by the COM-Poisson and the NB model confirmed that there was a
   perfect monotone increasing, and the values were highly correlated. This
   correlation means that a site characterized by a large variance would
   essentially be identified as such, whether the NB model or the
   COM-Poisson model was used.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic foams continue to interest researchers owing to their unique and
   enhanced properties. Existing studies attest to the importance of
   fabrication mechanisms and parameters. However, disparity in
   thermo-mechanical parameters has left much debate as to which factors
   dominate fabrication output quality. This paper provides experimental,
   computational, and statistical insights into the mechanisms that enable
   auxetic foams to be produced, using key parameters reported within the
   literature: porosity; heating time; and volumetric compression ratio. To
   advance the considerations on manufacturing parameter dominance, both
   study design and scale have been optimised to enable statistical
   inferences to be drawn. Whilst being unusual for a manufacturing domain,
   such additional analysis provides more conclusive evidence of auxetic
   properties and highlights the supremacy of volumetric compression ratio
   in predicting Poisson's ratio outcomes in the manufacture process.
   Furthermore statistical results are exploited to formulate key
   recommendations for those wishing to maximise/optimise auxetic foam
   production.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a method to optimize periodic microstructures for obtaining
   homogenized materials with negative Poisson ratio, using shape and/or
   topology variations in the model hole. The proposed approach employs
   worst case design in order to minimize the Poisson ratio of the
   (possibly anisotropic) homogenized elastic tensor in several prescribed
   directions. We use a minimization algorithm for inequality constraints
   based on an active set strategy and on a new algorithm for solving
   minimization problems with equality constraints, belonging to the class
   of null-space gradient methods. It uses first order derivatives of both
   the objective function and the constraints. The step is computed as a
   sum between a steepest descent step (minimizing the objective
   functional) and a correction step related to the Newton method (aiming
   to solve the equality constraints). The linear combination between these
   two steps involves coefficients similar to Lagrange multipliers which
   are computed in a natural way based on the Newton method. The algorithm
   uses no projection and thus the iterates are not feasible; the
   constraints are only satisfied in the limit (after convergence). A local
   convergence result is proven for a general nonlinear setting, where both
   the objective functional and the constraints are not necessarily convex
   functions.}},

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF ADVANCED MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Abstract = {{An analytical method is proposed to determine the displacements of a
   composite cylindrical shell with auxetic honeycomb core layer and
   variable thickness under combined axial, internal, and external
   pressures. The thickness and pressure profiles can be arbitrary
   continuous functions. The displacements are defined in the framework of
   the first-order shear deformation theory. The composite shell consists
   of three layers, in which the inner and outer layers are isotropic and
   the core layer is made of an auxetic honeycomb material. The
   constitutive equations obey the Hooke law. The equilibrium equations
   which are a system of coupled differential equations with variable
   coefficients are extracted by employing the virtual work principle, and
   they are solved using the matched asymptotic expansion method of the
   perturbation technique. The effects of different parameters such as the
   geometry, honeycomb structure parameters, different load profiles, and
   the thicknesses on the results are studied. The results are compared
   with the finite element method and some other references.}},

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with the viscoelastic behavior of wood. The time
   dependency of the orthotropic compliance for beech wood is investigated
   by performing tensile (Te) and compressive (Co) creep experiments in all
   wood's orthotropic directions. Time evolution of the creep strain in the
   axial and lateral directions is recorded using the digital image
   correlation technique, to determine the time dependent Young's moduli
   and the Poisson's ratios needed for the calculation of the diagonal and
   nondiagonal elements of the viscoelastic compliance matrix. The results
   of this study demonstrate the viscoelastic character of wood, revealing
   the significant time influence on the mechanical behavior. The unequal
   time dependency of the Young's moduli and the Poisson's ratios obtained
   for the individual directions highlights the orthotropic nature of the
   viscoelastic compliance. Differences between the time dependent behavior
   for the compliance determined in Te and Co further indicate that the
   viscoelastic behavior of wood depends on the loading modality. Supported
   by the unequal evolution of the Te and Co creep strain, the results
   suggest that the time dependent stress-strain relationship of wood is
   essentially different in Te and Co. Poisson's ratio values, which are
   shown to increase with time in Te and decrease in Co, demonstrated this
   fact. The substantially different time dependency of the nondiagonal
   elements of the compliance matrix further emphasizes the complexity of
   the viscoelastic character of wood. Visualized by the time evolution of
   the corresponding nondiagonal elements ratio, differences between the Te
   and Co viscoelastic behavior become particularly visible in the time
   dependency of the orthotropic compliance asymmetry. (C) 2013 The Society

Abstract = {{In this paper, the large compressive deformation of low-density polymer
   foam is simulated by modeling a regular dodecahedron cell unit. The
   effects of strut thickness, cell size, Young's modulus and Poisson's
   ratio on the compressive mechanical behavior of foam are investigated.
   By the use of a factorial design, The results indicate that the strut
   thickness has the greatest effect on the maximum reaction force with
   positive non-linearity. Cell size ranks second in negative non-linear
   effect on the response while Young's modulus ranks third in positive
   linear effects. Moreover, the effect of the Poisson's ratio plays only a
   small role on the response. This study demonstrates that ideally, cell
   modeling with the properties of flexible open-cell foam material,
   followed by FE simulation, is an effective approach to understanding the
   mechanical behavior of foam during moulding process.}},

Abstract = {{The extraordinary properties of mechanical metamaterials are created
   from the geometrical design of their internal structures. As a result,
   the nature of classical mechanical metamaterials usually would not
   change and one geometrical design only corresponds to one set of
   mechanical behaviors. This restricts the application of metamaterials
   where an adaptive behavior is desirable. In this work, we demonstrate
   the dynamic and on-demand regulation of mechanical metamaterials through
   a combination of structural design and multimaterial 3D printing. We
   design a soft periodic lattice metamaterial containing two distinct
   deformation modes. One deformation mode is controlled by the zig-zagged
   topological defects, and the other one is controlled by the thermal
   activation of the responsive materials imbedded in the lattice. By
   regulating the deformation mode with ambient temperature, the effective
   Poisson ratio of the lattice can be intentionally switched between
   negative values and positive values. The mechanism of thermally tunable
   deformation is investigated both experimentally and theoretically,
   resulting in a predictive design space of the metamaterial. We believe
   our design principle opens up a new route for the exploration of
   metamaterials exhibiting extraordinary and programmable mechanical
   behaviors.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{105}},

Abstract = {{This work provides a rigorous analysis of the effective response, i.e.,
   average magnetization and magnetostriction, of magnetoelastic composites
   that are subjected to overall magnetic and mechanical loads. It
   clarifies the differences between a coupled magnetomechanical analysis
   in which one applies a Eulerian (current) magnetic field and an
   electroactive one where the Lagrangian (reference) electric field is
   usually applied. For this, we propose an augmented vector potential
   variational formulation to carry out numerical periodic homogenization
   studies of magnetoelastic solids at finite strains and magnetic fields.
   We show that the developed variational principle can be used for
   bottom-up design of microstructures with desired magnetomechanical
   coupling by properly canceling out the macro-geometry and specimen shape
   effects. To achieve that, we properly treat the average Maxwell stresses
   arising from the medium surrounding the magnetoelastic representative
   volume element (RVE), while at the same time we impose a uniform average
   Eulerian and not Lagrangian magnetic field. The developed variational
   principle is then used to study a large number of ideal as well as more
   realistic two-dimensional microstructures. We study the effect of
   particle volume fraction, particle distribution and particle shape and
   orientation upon the effective magnetoelastic response at finite
   strains. We consider also unstructured isotropic microstructures based
   on random adsorption algorithms and we carry out a convergence study of
   the representativity of the proposed unit cells. Finally, three-phase
   two-dimensional auxetic microstructures are analyzed. The first consists
   of a periodic distribution of voids and particle chains in a polymer
   matrix, while the second takes advantage of particle shape and chirality
   to produce negative and positive swelling by proper change of the
   chirality and the applied magnetic field. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

   that general mechanical trends, which hold for isotropic

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{186}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic cellular structures have garnered huge research interest as a
   candidate for energy absorption due to their appealing features,
   including extremely high indentation resistance and fracture resistance.
   However, auxetic foams reported so far typically can only sustain a very
   limited loading force and impact with a counter-intuitive behavior.
   Here, we report a highly efficient sound and shock absorber based on
   three-dimensional (3D) auxetic foam with two-dimensional (2D) wrinkled
   graphene oxide. Compared with pure polyurethane foam, the auxetic
   heterostructured polyurethane foam interconnected with 2D corrugated
   graphene oxide shows a sound absorbing capacity of 99.7\% at a frequency
   of 2,236 Hz and a shock energy absorbing time of 189\% during the impact
   loading. The synergistic effects between 3D auxetic foam and 2D wrinkled
   graphene oxide result in stable compressive cycling performance, more
   indentation resistance, and more energy dissipation during local impact
   loads. This 3D engineered auxetic porous structure with 2D crumpled
   graphene oxide provides a new and cost-effective strategy to effectively
   absorb acoustic and shock energy.}},

Abstract = {{The subject of the study are the models based on digital
   microstructures, in particular open-cell metallic foams characterized
   with the skeleton formed of convex or re-entrant cells. Recently, the
   auxetic materials revealing negative Poisson's ratio have attracted
   increasing attention in the context of modern materials applications. Up
   to date, the research of auxetics is mainly concentrating on the cell
   structure design and the analysis of quasi-static response. The dynamic
   properties of such materials are less known. Impact compressions of the
   two kind of foams under high-velocity are numerically analyzed. To
   simulate the deformation processes the finite element program ABAOUS is
   used. The computer tomography makes the basis for the formulation of
   computational model of virtual foam and the finite element
   discretization of the skeleton. For numerical simulations the
   constitutive elasto-viscoplasticity model is applied that defines the
   dynamic behavior of oxygen-free high conductivity (OFHC) Cu using the
   experimental data reported in the literature. The numerical predictions
   of crushing force for velocity 50 and 300 m/s are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We present a model for data in the form of matched pairs of counts. Our
   work is motivated by a problem in fission-track analysis, where the
   determination of a crystal's age is based on the ratio of counts of
   spontaneous and induced tracks. It is often reasonable to assume that
   the counts follow a Poisson distribution, but typically they are
   overdispersed and there exists a positive correlation between the
   numbers of spontaneous and induced tracks in the same crystal. We
   propose a model that allows for both overdispersion and correlation by
   assuming that the mean densities follow a bivariate Wishart
   distribution. Our model is quite general, having the usual
   negative-binomial and Poisson models as special cases. We propose a
   maximum-likelihood estimation method based on a stochastic
   implementation of the EM algorithm, and we derive the asymptotic
   standard errors of the parameter estimates. We illustrate the method
   with a data set of fission-track counts in matched areas of zircon
   crystals.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials, rationally designed multiscale composite systems, have
   attracted extensive interest because of their potential for a broad
   range of applications due to their unique properties such as negative
   Poisson's ratio, exceptional mechanical performance, tunable photonic
   and phononic properties, structural reconfiguration, etc. Though they
   are dominated by an auxetic structure, the constituents of metamaterials
   also play an indispensable role in determining their unprecedented
   properties. In this vein, 2D materials such as graphene, silicene, and
   phosphorene with superior structural tunability are ideal candidates for
   constituents of metamaterials. However, the nanostructure-property
   relationship and composition-property relationship of these 2D
   material-based metamaterials remain largely unexplored. Mechanical
   anisotropy inherited from the 2D material constituents, for example, may
   substantially impact the physical stability and robustness of the
   corresponding metamaterial systems. Herein, classical molecular dynamics
   simulations are performed using a generic coarse-grained model to
   explore the deformation mechanism of these 2D material-based
   metamaterials with sinusoidally curved ligaments and the effect of
   mechanical anisotropy on mechanical properties, especially the negative
   Poisson's ratio. The results indicate that deformation under axial
   tensile load can be divided into two stages: bending-dominated and
   stretching-dominated, in which the rotation of junctions in the former
   stage results in auxetic behavior of the proposed metamaterials. In
   addition, the auxetic behavior depends heavily on both the
   amplitude/wavelength ratio of the sinusoidal ligament and the stiffness
   ratio between axial and transverse directions. The magnitude of negative
   Poisson's ratio increases from 0 to 0.625, with an associated increase
   of the amplitude/wavelength ratio from 0 to 0.225, and fluctuates at
   around 0.625, in good agreement with the literature, with
   amplitude/wavelength ratios greater than 0.225. More interestingly, the
   magnitude of negative Poisson's ratio increases from 0.47 to 0.87 with
   the increase of the stiffness ratio from 0.125 to 8, in good agreement
   with additional all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for phosphorene
   and molybdenum disulfide. Overall, these research findings shed light on
   the deformation mechanism of auxetic metamaterials, providing useful
   guidelines for designing auxetic 2D lattice structures made of 2D
   materials that can display a tunable negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Knowing the structures of the crust and upper mantle is fundamental for
   understanding of the geodynamics of the orogenic belt. To provide
   observational seismic evidences on deep structures of crust and mantle
   beneath the intersection zone of Nanling and Wuyi, we conduct the
   crustal imaging obtained from P-wave receiver functions. In this study,
   P-wave receiver functions are calculated using teleseismic waveforms
   recorded by 66 portable broadband stations and 24 permanent stations. We
   also obtain the crustal thickness, Poisson's ratio and image of the Moho
   interface by using the H-kappa stacking method and Common Conversion
   Point (CCP) stacking method, which indicate the variationsin crustal
   thickness and Poisson's ratio between the Yangtze block and the
   Cathaysia block.
   The results show that : (1) The average thickness of the crust is 31. 2
   km with the average Poisson's ratio of 0. 23. The study area (Both the
   Yangtze block and the Cathaysia block are) is characterized by thin
   crust and low Poisson' s ratio. Further, the thickness of crust
   gradually decreases from northwest to southeast, which is consistent
   with the regional extension of the crust. (2) Along the
   Shaoguan-Ganzhou-Jian-Nanchang profile, a strip of thin (about 28 km)
   crustal thickness is observed, indicating a southwest-northeast
   spreading, with a slight increase of the Poisson's ratio. The results
   suggest that the upwelling of mantle heat flow from the South China Sea
   leads to the formation of a weak zone in the crust and plays an
   important role in regulating the crustal stress field in the South
   China. (3) The Poisson's ratio in the Jiangnan orogenic belt is
   relatively low, with average value of two areas less than 0. 21. There
   is a weak negative correlation between the crustal thickness and the
   Poisson's ratio in the Cathaysia block, indicating a decrease of the
   proportion of the ferromagnesian lower-crust thickness in the entire
   crust with the increase of crustal thickness. The Poisson's ratio of the
   Cathaysia block is smaller than that of the Yangtze block, which may be
   related to the late formation of the crust and the multiple tectonic
   activities that have occurred since the Phanerozoic.}},

Abstract = {{It is demonstrated that the large-amplitude, short-wavelength
   vibrational modes excited in the lattice can change its elastic
   properties due to physical and/or geometric nonlinearity of the lattice
   bonds. Depending on the symmetry of the vibrational mode the symmetry of
   the elastic properties of the lattice can also change. Using as an
   example the two-dimensional honeycomb structure with beta-FPU pairwise
   interparticle interactions, we demonstrate that the excitation of a
   large-amplitude vibrational mode in combination with equiaxial tensile
   strain can change the sign of the Poisson's ratio from positive to
   negative, thus leading to the auxetic property of the lattice. It is
   shown that the considered lattice supports discrete breathers, i.e.,
   spatially localized nonlinear vibrational modes. The excitation of the
   discrete breathers as a result of the modulational instability of the
   extended short-wavelength modes is analyzed. Our results contribute to
   the understanding of the relation between the elastic properties and
   nonlinear dynamics of the lattices of interacting particles. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The results of variable dielectric coefficient Poisson-Boltzmann
   calculations of the counter-ion concentration in the vicinity of an
   all-atom model of the B-form of DNA are presented with an emphasis on
   the importance of spatial variations in the dielectric properties of the
   solvent, particularly at the macro-ion-solvent interface. Calculations
   of the distribution of hard-sphere electrolyte ions of various
   dimensions are reported.
   The presence of a dielectric boundary significantly increases the
   magnitude of the electrostatic potential with a concomitant increase in
   the accumulation of small counter-ions in the groove regions of DNA.
   Because ions with radii greater than 2 angstrom have restricted access
   to the minor groove, the effect there is less significant than it is
   within the major groove. Changes in the dielectric coefficient for the
   electrolyte solution, allowing variation from 10 to 25, 40, 60, and 78.5
   within the first 7.4 angstrom of the surface of DNA, substantially
   increases the calculated surface concentration of counter-ions of all
   sizes. A lower dielectric coefficient near the macro-ion surface also
   tends to increase the counter-ion density in regions where the
   electrostatic potential is more negative than -kT. Regardless of the
   choice of dielectric coefficient, the number of ions in regions where
   the electrostatic potential is less than -kT remains the same for 0.153
   M added 1-1 monovalent electrolyte as for the case without added salt.
   The strong dependence of the calculated distribution of counter-ion
   density on the choice of dielectric coefficients representing the
   solvent continuum suggests that care must be taken to properly
   characterize the physical system when studying electrostatic properties
   using these methods.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The study of half-metallic behavior, thermoelectric properties and
   thermodynamic stability of the new quaternary PdZrTiAl Heusler were
   carried out based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.
   The generalized gradient approximation with Tran-Blaha potential (GGA +
   mbJ) was utilized to treat the exchangecorrelation energy for the
   calculations of electronic structures. More accurate results of the
   dynamic stability investigation of the intended Heusler compound were
   obtained by using and Quantum Molecular Dynamic (QMD) simulation.
   Calculation of the electronic structure indicates that the PdZrTiAl
   compound has an indirect band gap 0.69eV (from GGA + mbJ) in the down
   spin and therefore is a ferromagnetic half-metal with 3.00 mu B magnetic
   moment. The investigation of the thermodynamic phase diagram showed that
   this material is stable in all thermodynamic conditions. Furthermore,
   the phonon positive frequencies and the results of QMD, confirms the
   sustainability of this structure in XX.YZ stoichiometric compound. The
   elastic constants reveal that the PdZrTiAl are mechanically stable and
   the Poisson's ratio confirmed that the alloys considered are ductile.
   Also, thermoelectric properties of this compound were studied using
   transport quasi-classical theory. It was observed that in two majority
   and minority spin states, this combination shows an utterly distinct
   thermoelectric behavior. This compound has a good merit coefficient at
   dn spin at all temperature ranges, especially at low temperatures and
   the negative sign of the Seebeck coefficient indicates that electrons
   are charge carriers.}},

Title = {{A physical modeling-based study on the control mechanisms of Negative
   Poisson's ratio anchor cable on the stratified toppling deformation of
   anti-inclined slopes}},

Abstract = {{With ongoing increases in excavation depth, the large-scale toppling
   instability failure of stratified anti-inclined slopes is gaining wide
   attention. To address the problem of controlling toppling deformation
   failure of anti-inclined slopes with traditional small-deformation
   materials, this paper takes the results of existing studies on the
   extraordinary mechanical properties of engineering-scale Negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) anchor cable as a theoretical basis, and develops
   a model-scale NPR anchor cable according to similarity theory. Relying
   on a self-developed ``engineering disaster model experimental
   system{''}, a physical modeling-based experiment to explore the
   reinforcement mechanism of stratified anti-inclined slope using
   model-scale NPR and ordinary anchor cables is performed. The physical
   model is monitored using static strain data acquisition equipment, an
   infrared thermal imager, tension sensors, and digital speckle
   correlation method (DSCM) displacement field measurement equipment. The
   evolution of the displacement field, strain field, temperature field,
   and anchor cable force are obtained during excavation on the physical
   model. By comparing the evolution of these parameters with images from
   both the anti-inclined slope model instability failure test and the
   deformation characteristics on the two sides of the slope, which were
   reinforced using different types of anchor cables, this paper determines
   the mechanisms governing instability failure of anti-inclined slopes
   reinforced with NPR anchor cable. In addition, this paper also proves
   that NPR anchor cable can be used to monitor the sliding force of
   anti-inclined slopes throughout excavation, and lays a foundation for
   the application of NPR anchor cable monitoring technology to the
   advanced anti-inclined slope failure warning.}},

   been used here to perform the analysis. Resonators are included to open
   resonant band gaps in addition to the Bragg band gaps given by the
   periodicity of the core. Studies on the number of resonators inside the
   unit cell have been performed for a constant mass to identify the
   configuration which are able to open stop bands at low frequency range.
   Also, a parametric analysis on the resonator properties is done to
   compare the benefit concerning wave propagation while having a

Abstract = {{A least-squares estimator of the intensity of a Poisson process is
   studied for a partially observed stochastic system, where the signal

Abstract = {{Using a simple model to represent the complex relationship between

   correct modelization of mechanical behaviors in viscoelastic solids. In
   this paper, a time-based fractional longitudinal-transverse strain model
   is presented based on the analogy with fractional stress-strain
   equation. Experimental results of a series of uniaxial compression and
   tension tests under strain-relaxation and constant longitudinal strain
   rate are employed to validate the proposed model. It is shown that the
   fractional longitudinal-transverse strain model can accurately describe
   the experimental response, and the fractional order may be positive or
   negative, which is helpful to characterize the complicated
   longitudinal-transverse deformation relationship.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the structural, electronic and optical properties of
   theoretically predicted C6N monolayer structure are investigated by
   means of Density Functional Theory-based First-Principles Calculations.
   Phonon band dispersion calculations and molecular dynamics simulations
   reveal the dynamical and thermal stability of the C6N single-layer
   structure. We found out that the C6N monolayer has large negative
   in-plane Poisson's ratios along both X and Y direction and the both
   values are almost four times that of the famous-pentagraphene. The
   electronic structure shows that C6N monolayer is a semi-metal and has a
   Dirac-point in the BZ. The optical analysis using the random phase
   approximation method constructed over HSE06 illustrates that the first
   peak of absorption coefficient of the C6N monolayer along all
   polarizations is located in the IR range of spectrum, while the second
   absorption peak occurs in the visible range, which suggests its
   potential applications in optical and electronic devices. Interestingly,
   optically anisotropic character of this system is highly desirable for
   the design of polarization-sensitive photodetectors. Thermoelectric
   properties such as Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity,
   electronic thermal conductivity and power factor are investigated as a
   function of carrier doping at temperatures 300, 400, and 500 K. In
   general, we predict that the C6N monolayer could be a new platform for
   study of novel physical properties in two-dimensional semi-metal
   materials, which may provide new opportunities to realize high-speed
   low-dissipation devices.}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel three dimensional (3D) AuxHex lattice structure
   consisting of auxetic re-entrant and hexagonal components is proposed.
   Theoretical models of elastic constants and quasi-static plateau stress
   are established which indicate that the AuxHex lattice structures have
   zero Poisson's ratio and better energy absorption capacity than
   traditional auxetic re-entrant cellular structures. Numerical simulation
   is also used to study the mechanical properties of 3D AuxHex lattice
   structures, which presents good agreements with theoretical models. The
   experimental specimens are fabricated via 3D printing technique and the
   compression tests are also carried out to validate the accuracy of
   theoretical models and numerical simulations. To overcome the problem of
   unstable quasi-static crushing of 3D AuxHex structures with thin struts
   (low relative density), the hybrid stable AuxHex lattice (HSAL)
   structure is designed by inserting auxiliary structure to AuxHex lattice
   to make the AuxHex structures more stable and obtain higher energy
   absorption efficiency. The influence of material gradient index is
   investigated numerically, which shows the positive and negative
   gradients have different effects on the energy absorption behavior under
   various loading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In both flexible Poisson Tweedie (PT) and Poisson-exponential-Tweedie
   (PET) over-dispersed count models, the common power parameter p is an
   element of \{0\} boolean OR {[}1, infinity) works as an automatic
   distribution selection. It mainly separates two subclasses of
   zero-inflated (1 <= p < 2) and heavy-tailed (p > 2). Although extensive
   works have been conducted in discriminating between continuous and
   semicontinuous distribution functions, not much attention has been paid
   to discriminating between discrete distribution functions. Estimations
   based on the likelihood approach for PT and PETS are challenging owing
   to the presence of an infinity sum and intractable integrals in their
   probability mass functions. Thus, we attempt to perform a Monte Carlo
   simulation to approximate them. In this paper, we invest the ratio of
   the maximized likelihoods within each subclass of these two models for
   discrimination purposes based on classic measures of dispersion,
   zero-inflation and heavy tail of both PT and PET models. Grounded only
   on dispersion index, we also discriminate two particular cases of the
   Hermite distribution with respect to its geometric version (p = 0) and
   the negative binomial one with its geometric version (p = 2).
   Probabilities of correct selection for several combinations of
   dispersion parameters, means and sample sizes are examined by
   simulations. We carry out a numerical comparison study to assess the
   discrimination procedures in these subclasses of two families.}},

Abstract = {{The paper discusses the behavior of beams with external damping patches
   made of auxetic materials. The damping force is modeled by using the
   nonlocal theory. Unlike the local models, the nonlocal damping force is
   modeled as a weighted average of the velocity field over the spatial
   domain, determined by a kernel function based on distance measures. The
   performance with respect to the eigenvalues is discussed next, in order
   to avoid resonance. The optimization is performed by determining the
   location of patches from maximizing the eigenvalues, or the gap between
   them. Copyright (C) 2009 Veturia Chiroiu et al.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of measurements performed on
   alpha-quartz subjected to shear stress in dry conditions, to understand
   the relationship between the shear intensity and the resulting physical
   and chemical effects. If a shear stress of intensity higher than 100 MPa
   is applied continuously to alpha quartz crystals, they will tend to lose
   their crystallinity, progressively reduce their friction coefficient
   (Cof) and change into a low-order material, apparently amorphous under
   X-ray diffraction, but with a structure different from silica glass.
   Raman and Pair Distribution Function analyses suggested a structure like
   cristobalite, a silica polymorph well-known for its auxetic behavior,
   i.e., having a negative Poisson ratio. This elastic parameter
   pre-eminently controls the friction coefficient of the material and, if
   it is negative, the Cof lowering. As a result, the increase in low
   crystallinity cristobalite is sufficientto explain the lowering of the
   quartz friction coefficient up to values able to contribute, in
   principle, to the triggering processes of active faults. This allows
   hypothesizing a slip induction mechanism that does not include the need
   to have the interposition of layers of hydrated silica, as invoked by
   many authors, to justify the low friction coefficients that are achieved
   in shear stress tests on rocks abundant in quartz.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic properties of an auxetic foam were measured to validate a
   previously proposed lower bound for Poisson's ratio, nu >= 1/5, inferred
   from classical two-parameter elasticity theory. This limit differs from
   the commonly reported lower limit of -1 for isotropic materials in the
   linear elastic range. For a foam measured to have a value of nu > 0.2,
   agreement was found between the measured flexural resonance frequency of
   a disk sample and the theoretical value. On the other hand, for an
   auxetic sample (nu < 0), the prediction from the two-parameter theory
   was significantly in error. Thus, for materials having nu < 1/5 (auxetic
   foams, as well as very hard solids such as diamond, germanium, and fused
   quartz), the equations of classical elasticity are invalid.}},

   MnB4 indicate that they are thermodynamically stable at zero pressure.
   It is found that MnB2-ReB2 is more energetically favorable than
   synthetic MnB2-AlB2, which indicates that experimental synthesized MnB2
   is a metastable phase. Among these studied compounds, monoclinic MnB4
   has the largest shear modulus, the largest Young's modulus, and the
   smallest Poisson's ratio. The results of density of states and Mulliken
   overlap population reveal the strong covalent bonding, which results in
   the high bulk and shear moduli as well as small Poisson's ratio of
   MnB2-ReB2 and MnB4. An analysis of the elastic constants, elastic

Abstract = {{Recently, technologies for the production of cellular materials have
   been proposed that allow for a seamless change of the geometries of such
   materials from being similar to sintered hollow sphere structures to
   resembling comparatively regular polyhedra. In order to investigate, how
   the linear elastic properties Of Such materials are effected by this
   change in geometry, analyses of the expansion process are carried out by
   the finite element method for obtaining cell wall thickness
   distributions. These material distributions are then transferred to
   finite element unit cell models that are suitable for predicting the
   effective, macroscopic elastic properties. It is found that Young's
   modulus, as well as the shear modulus increase monotonically with
   increasing degree of expansion. Furthermore, negative Poisson's ratios
   are predicted for configurations that are comparable to sintered hollow
   sphere structures, while positive Poisson's ratios are observed for
   highly expanded configurations.}},

Abstract = {{The zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model with
   smoothing is introduced for modeling count data with many zero-valued
   observations, and its use is illustrated with shark bycatch data from
   the eastern Pacific Ocean tuna purse-seine fishery for 1994-2004. Based
   on the generalized information criterion, the ZINB regression model
   provided a better fit to the data than either Poisson, negative binomial
   or zero-inflated Poisson regression models. To demonstrate the utility
   of the ZINB regression model for the standardization of catch data,
   standardized temporal trends in bycatch rates estimated with the ZINB
   regression model are computed and compared to those obtained from fits
   of the other three types of models to the same data. With the exception
   of the negative binomial, estimated temporal trends were more similar
   among models than would have been inferred from an analysis of model
   fit. Comparison of trends among models suggests that the negative
   binomial regression model may overestimate model coefficients when
   fitted to data with many zero-valued observations. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The mechanical parameters of shale are some of the most significant
   assessment indices for shale gas exploitation. The development of
   element logging offers an opportunity to study the correlations between
   the elemental concentrations and the mechanical characteristics of
   shale. Using the Lower Cambrian shale in the Cen'gong area, Guizhou
   Province, China, as an example, 490 data sets are extracted using
   formation element and mineralogy (FEM) and cross multipole array
   acoustic (XMAC) logging. Through Spearman correlation analysis, the
   correlations between the major elements (Si, Ca, Fe, S, Ti, Mn, Mg, Al,
   and K) and the mechanical parameters (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio,
   shear strength, shear modulus, and brittleness index) are studied. The
   effects of the Si content on the mechanical parameters
   (positive/negative correlations, magnitude and significance of the
   correlations) are discussed based on X-ray diffraction analyses of the
   minerals in 146 samples. When 1.84\% < C-si (Si content) < 28.08\%,
   Young's modulus and the brittleness index decrease with increasing Si
   content, and Poisson's ratio increases. When 28.08\% < C-si < 31.32\%,
   there is no significant correlation between the Si content and the
   mechanical parameters. When 31.32\% < C-si < 44.24\%, Young's modulus
   and the brittleness index increase with increasing Si content, and
   Poisson's ratio decreases. Thus, it is not reasonable to determine the
   mechanical properties of shale based only on the elemental composition
   in different regions.}},

Abstract = {{Recent results of theoretical and practical importance prove that the
   two-dimensional (in-plane) effective (average) Young's modulus for an
   isotropic elastic material containing voids is independent of the
   Poisson's ratio of the matrix material. This result is true regardless
   of the shape and morphology of the voids so long as isotropy is
   maintained. The present work uses this proof to obtain explicit
   analytical forms for the effective Young's modulus property, forms which
   simplify greatly because of this characteristic. In some cases, the
   optimal morphology for the voids can be identified, giving the shapes of
   the voids. at fixed volume, that maximize the effective Young's modulus
   in the two-dimensional situation. Recognizing that two-dimensional
   isotropy is a subset of three-dimensional transversely isotropic media,
   it is shown in this more general case that three of the five properties
   independent of Poisson's ratio, leaving only two that depend upon it.
   For three-dimensionally isotropic composite media containing voids, it
   is shown that a somewhat comparable situation exists whereby the
   three-dimensional Young's modulus is insensitive to variations in
   Poisson's ratio, nu(m), over the range 0 less-than-or-equal-to nu(m)
   less-than-or-equal-to 1/2. although the same is not true for negative
   values of nu(m). This further extends the practical usefulness of the
   two-dimensional result to three-dimensional conditions for realistic
   values of nu(m).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL TEXTILES}},
Abstract = {{The paper deals with development and characterization of 3D sandwich
   composite structures reinforced with newly-designed multi-cell
   flat-knitted spacer fabrics in terms of compressive behaviour and
   Poisson's ratio. Multi-cell spacer knitted preforms was produced on a
   computerized flat knitting machine. 3D composite samples with three
   different cross-sectional geometries were prepared via vacuum assisted
   resin transfer moulding method. Quasi-static compressive experiments
   were carried out on the prepared 3D composite samples. The Poisson's
   ratio of re-entrant 3D knitted composite varied between -6 and -1, which
   clearly points to existence of auxetic behaviour of the samples. The
   re-entrant 3D composites also demonstrated the highest initial slope and
   area under the compression force-displacement curve than spear-head or
   hexagonal composite structures which refer to higher energy absorbing
   capacity. The Poisson's ratio of 3D regular hexagonal knitted composites
   at small strain was usually 4 which gradually decreased to 1.6 as the
   exerted compressive strain increased. Additionally, 3D spear-head
   knitted composite having zero Poisson's ratio was also developed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) was used for impact
   loading of an auxetic lattice (structure with negative Poissons ratio)
   at a given strain-rate. High strength aluminum and polymethyl
   methacrylate bars instrumented with foil strain-gauges were used for
   compression of an additively manufactured missing-rib auxetic lattice.
   All experiments were observed using a high-speed camera with frame-rate
   set to approx. 135.000 fps. High-speed images were synchronized with the
   strain-gauge records. Dynamic equilibrium in the specimen was analyzed
   and optimized pulse-shaping was introduced in the selected experiments.
   Longitudinal and lateral in-plane displacements and strains were
   evaluated using digital image correlation (DIC) technique. DIC results
   were compared with results obtained from strain-gauges and were found to
   be in good agreement. Using DIC, it was possible to analyze in-plane
   strain distribution in the specimens and to evaluate strain dependent
   Poissons ratio of the auxetic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular structures having negative Poisson's ratios can be designed to
   have high shear flexure properties. In this paper, the elastic limits of
   hexagonal honeycombs including the ones having negative Poisson's ratios
   (NPR) are explored with various cell geometries under simple shear
   loading. While designing a shear modulus, e.g., G(12)(center dot) of 10
   MPa, of hexagonal honeycombs, corresponding meso-structures are designed
   with three constituent materials; an aluminum alloy (7075-T6). a
   titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V), and a high strength steel (ANSI 4340). The
   in-plane linear elastic honeycomb model is employed to achieve the shear
   moduli of the hexagonal honeycombs made of the three constituent
   materials. The shear strengths, (tau(center dot)(pl))(12) and shear
   yield strains, (gamma(center dot)(pl))(12) of hexagonal honeycombs are
   obtained from finite element analysis using ABAQUS. The titanium alloy
   honeycombs show a good shear flexure property having both high
   (tau(center dot)(pl))(12) and (gamma(center dot)(pl))(12) when it is
   designed to the target G(12)(center dot). The re-entrant geometry makes
   honeycombs flexible associated with a high effective bending length. (C)

Abstract = {{In the task to accurately model auxetic foams, a number of details must
   be correctly accounted for. Firstly, the micro-structure is not simple
   and can only be qualitatively described by traditional, regular,
   cellular models. Computed tomography (CT) data has been used to begin to
   describe the details of the complex geometry of the foams'
   microstructure and to describe it in a manner suitable for advanced
   models. Using these modelling techniques that are able to capture
   difficult geometries, values of the local and global mechanical
   properties are calculated. These mechanical calculations are based on a
   linear elastic core and global properties are a mean strain estimate.
   The latter is shown to be inadequate, highlighting the need for a
   heterogeneous basis for accurate modelling. The significant mechanical
   anisotropy of the material is reported and mechanical results are recast
   according to axis of major and minor principal stiffness demonstrating
   the elastic symmetry of the foam and a requirement of an objective
   methodology in modelling an inherently anisotropic material. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{To ensure the effectiveness of fracturing treatment and improve the
   production reserves of individual wells, it is important to accurately
   predict the in situ stress distribution to prevent the collapse of
   horizontal wells. From the perspective of reservoir development, under
   similar structural environments, microscopic factors, such as reservoir
   and petrophysical characteristics, are often the key factors that affect
   reservoir fracturing differences and drilling design in different well
   areas. Therefore, we need to understand the microscopic factors that
   affect the distribution of in situ stress. Here, we have determined the
   three-dimensional distribution of in situ stress in the Ordos Basin of
   China through the finite element numerical simulation method and
   revealed the influencing factors. By establishing a reservoir
   heterogeneity model and a geomechanical heterogeneity model and with the
   finite element method, the 3D distribution of reservoir physical
   parameters and in situ stress can be predicted, and the effects of the
   reservoir physical properties, fluid properties, rock acoustic velocity
   and mechanical properties on the in situ stress can be determined. The
   clay content is found to be negatively correlated with the horizontal
   stress difference (Delta sigma) and horizontal principal stress
   difference coefficient (Kh()). Rock density, porosity, and permeability
   have little effect on Delta sigma and K-h. Fluid properties affect the
   in situ stress magnitude. If the water saturation is greater than 60\%,
   this parameter has a negative correlation with Delta sigma and K-h.
   Poisson's ratio has a weak effect on Delta sigma but a significant
   negative correlation with K-h.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials have received wide attention due to their
   idiosyncratic physical properties. In this paper, experiments and
   simulations were performed to study the mechanical and acoustic
   properties of a 3D anti-chiral auxetic metamaterial subjected to
   quasi-static loading. The results shows that Poisson's ratio of the
   designed metamaterial can be changed from -0.45 to 0.35 with different
   cell parameters. Acoustic tests show that the designed metamaterial
   provides an ultra-wide phononic bandgap and exhibits outstanding wave
   attenuation properties. By applying rational tensile/compression force,
   the bandgap is widened/narrowed, which indicates the tunability of the
   bandgap through deformation. Moreover, the bandgap tuning is through all
   high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone due to the iso-auxeticity of
   the metamaterial. This study provides a possible way for controlling the
   bandgap with the deformable metamaterial.}},

Abstract = {{The stability, mechanical properties and electronic structures of Ti3Al,
   TiAl, TiAl2 and TiAl3 have been systematically investigated by the
   first-principles calculation. The four Ti-Al binary compounds are
   thermodynamically stable intermetallics depending on their negative
   formation enthalpy and cohesive energy. The bulk modulus (B), shear
   modulus (G), Young's modulus (E), Vicker's hardness (H-v) and Poisson's
   ratio (v) are calculated. With the increment of Al content, the bulk
   modulus and Poisson's ratio decrease while the shear modulus, Young's
   modulus and hardness gradually increase. The ratio of B/G decreases with
   Al increment, implying the weakening of ductility. In addition, the
   mechanical anisotropy of Ti-Al compound has been revealed by the
   analysis of the anisotropy index, three-dimensional surface contours of
   the Young's modulus and the planar projections on the low index planes
   (including (100), (010), (100) and (110)). TiAl shows the most
   anisotropic structure while Ti3Al has the least anisotropy. The density
   of states (DOS) and electron density distribution map are discussed to
   analyze the electronic structures and chemical bonding characters. The
   Ti-Al binary compounds are composed of both metallic and covalent bonds,
   and the covalent bonding character can be strengthened with the increase
   of Al content.}},

Abstract = {{Continuing from Part I (Christensen, 2014, ``Failure Mechanics-Part I:
   The Coordination Between Elasticity Theory and Failure Theory for all
   Isotropic Materials,{''} ASME J. Appl. Mech., 81(8), p. 081001), the
   relationship between elastic energy and failure specification is further
   developed. Part I established the coordination of failure theory with
   elasticity theory, but subject to one overriding assumption: that the
   values of the involved Poisson's ratios always be non-negative. The
   present work derives the physical proof that, contrary to fairly common
   belief, Poisson's ratio must always be non-negative. It can never be
   negative for homogeneous and isotropic materials. This is accomplished
   by first probing the reduced two-dimensional (2D) elasticity problem
   appropriate to graphene, then generalizing to three-dimensional (3D)
   conditions. The nanomechanics analysis of graphene provides the key to
   the entire development. Other aspects of failure theory are also
   examined and concluded positively. Failure theory as unified with
   elasticity theory is thus completed, finalized, and fundamentally
   validated.}},

Title = {{Elasto-plastic behavior of the Fontainebleau sandstone based on a
   refined continuous strain deviation approach}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Abstract = {{The elasto-plastic behavior of the Fontainebleau sandstone is studied
   from experimental and numerical points of view on the basis of a series
   of conventional triaxial compression tests. Five distinct stages of the
   axial strain curve are quantified in terms of four stress thresholds
   (crack closure stress sigma(cc), crack initiation stress sigma(ci),
   crack damage stress sigma(cd)and short-term peak strength sigma(p)). The
   onset of dilation and total volumetric strain reversal occur at axial
   stress level 30-50\% and 50-80\% of sigma(p), respectively. A refined
   continuous strain deviation (RCSD) method is proposed to more accurately
   define the elastic parameters. Other internal state variables are
   determined accordingly. Some important information are gained as
   follows: (1) the Poisson's ratio decreases with the increase of the
   confining pressure; (2) at the same stress level, the higher of the
   confining pressure, the smaller of the negative plastic volumetric
   strain (dilatancy); (3) the evolution of the friction-like coefficient
   and the plastic volumetric strain can be described with an exponential
   function and a hyperbolic function, respectively. A strictly
   experimental based constitutive model is proposed to study the
   elasto-plastic behavior of the Fontainebleau sandstone. All numerical
   aspects including formulations, algorithms and experimental validations,
   are presented in detail.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this research is to investigate the
   thermoporoelastic behavior of non-homogeneous circular plate made up of
   auxetic metamaterial rested on an auxetic material plate. The plate is
   non-uniform, restrained with flexible support at outer edge and
   subjected to structure-structure interaction and thermo-mechanical load.
   The plate material is graded in transverse direction and the Poisson's
   ratio is constant. Based on the linear thermoporoelasticity theory, the
   governing state equations in terms of displacements and temperature are
   acquired. At first, the one-dimensional heat equation including
   quadratic type heat source is solved to compute the nonlinear
   distribution of temperature across the thickness. Then, the state
   equations are solved semi-analytically using state-space (SS) method and
   differential quadrature (DQ) rule to predict the elastic field
   quantities. A comprehensive parametric discussion is accomplished to
   elucidate the effects of key parameters on the steady-state response of
   the plate to mechanical and thermal loads. The computed results indicate
   that the auxeticity of the structure and supporting medium, as well as
   the thermal environment, play a significant role in the
   thermoporoelastic behavior of the plate.}},

Title = {{Numerical analysis of frictional contact in the presence of a surface
   crack in a functionally graded coating substrate system}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the frictional two-dimensional contact in the presence of
   a surface crack in a functionally graded coating substrate system is
   studied for rigid circular and flat stamps. A computational method based
   on finite difference (FD) is developed to evaluate the contact stresses
   and also the fracture parameters, which are K-I and K-II due to mixed
   mode fracture. The FD method applied here, uses a mapping technique
   which enable the analysis to consider any geometry of the punch and the
   crack. The Coulomb's dry friction law is considered in the contact area.
   The advantage of this study, compared to the efforts done by other
   researchers, is the ability to analysis a system with any arbitrary
   material properties distribution. Here, the elastic material properties
   distribution is estimated by TTO model which takes into account the
   interaction between the constituting phases as well, and the Poisson's
   ratio is assumed to be constant. The effect of material nonhomogeneity,
   the interaction of the constituting phases, the thickness of the graded
   coating layer, the size of the punch and the coefficient of friction is
   studied. In a general case, the findings of this research show that
   increasing the size of the punch, the coefficient of friction and the
   thickness of the graded layer increase the contact force and hence the
   contact stress; however, the interaction of the constituting phases does
   not have any effects on the contact parameters. In frictionless contact,
   the stress intensity factor is negative. In addition, increasing the
   coefficient of friction increases K-I but decreases K-II. These results
   are valid for any materials properties distribution. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Trichel streamer pulses have been simulated at various air pressures and
   humidities. A flux-corrected transport algorithm based on a non-uniform
   mesh was applied to solve the continuity equations and Poisson's
   equation in a fluid model to calculate the negative streamer pulse
   waveforms. The values of the various coefficients for humid air,
   considered as a mixture of air and water vapor, were estimated by linear
   interpolation from the values for the separate `gases'. The simulation
   results agreed with the trends in the experimental results of our
   previous study: the average amplitudes of the negative streamers
   decreased with a rise of pressure or humidity. The decrease of current
   amplitude with the rise of pressure was mainly due to the decrease in
   the electron density and hence the conductivity of the streamer channel
   as a result of the increase of attachment rate.}},

Pages = {{72-87}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new model named as the multivariate generalized
   Poisson logt geometric process (MGPLTGP) model to study multivariate
   time-series of counts with overdispersion or underdispersion,
   non-monotone trends within each time-series and positive or negative
   correlation between pairs of time-series: This model assumes that the
   multivariate counts follow independent generalized Poisson distributions
   with an additional parameter to adjust for different degrees of
   dispersion including overdispersion and underdispersion. Their means
   after discounting the trend effect geometrically by ratio functions form
   latent stochastic processes and follow a multivariate log-t distribution
   with a flexible correlation structure to capture both positive
   correlation and negative correlation. By expressing the multivariate
   Student's t-distribution in scale mixtures of normals, the model can be
   implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms via the
   user-friendly WinBUGS software. The applicability of the MGPLTGP model
   is illustrated through an analysis of the possession and/or use of two
   illicit drugs, amphetamines and narcotics in New South Wales, Australia.

Title = {{On the Problematic Case of Product Approximation in Backus Average}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELASTICITY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{144}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-80}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Elastic anisotropy might be a combined effect of the intrinsic
   anisotropy and the anisotropy induced by thin-layering. The Backus
   average, a useful mathematical tool, allows us to describe such an
   effect quantitatively. The results are meaningful only if the underlying
   physical assumptions are obeyed, such as static equilibrium of the
   material. We focus on the only mathematical assumption of the Backus
   average, namely, product approximation. It states that the average of
   the product of a varying function with a nearly constant function is
   approximately equal to the product of the averages of those functions.
   We analyse particular problematic case for which the aforementioned
   assumption is inaccurate. Furthermore, we focus on the seismological
   context. We examine the inaccuracy's effect on the wave propagation in a
   homogenous medium-obtained using the Backus average-equivalent to thin
   layers. Numerical simulations indicate clearly that the product
   approximation inaccuracy has negligible effect on wave propagation;
   irrespective of layers' symmetries. To give the results a practical
   focus, we show that the problematic case of product approximation is
   strictly related to the negative Poisson's ratio of constituents layers.
   We discuss the laboratory and well-log cases in which such a ratio has
   been noticed. Upon thorough literature review, it occurs that examples
   of so-called auxetic materials (media that have negative Poisson's
   ratio) are not extremely rare exceptions as thought previously. The
   investigation and derivation of Poisson's ratio for materials exhibiting
   symmetry classes up to monoclinic become a significant part of this
   paper. In addition to the main objectives, we also show that the
   averaging of cubic layers results in an equivalent medium with
   tetragonal (not cubic) symmetry. We present concise formulations of
   stability conditions for low symmetry classes, such as trigonal,
   orthotropic, and monoclinic.}},

   honeycombs with entrapped gas}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{146}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This work aims to study the uniaxial dynamic compression response of
   hexagonal honeycombs with different cell morphologies in the presence of
   an entrapped gas. A theoretical model is proposed to estimate the
   dynamic crushing strength of non-auxetic honeycombs while including the
   effect of the entrapped gas on the crushing process. The theoretical
   predictions are shown to agree well with the finite element (FE)
   simulations. From the numerical simulations, Hugoniot relations between
   the shock velocity and the impact velocity are obtained for various
   honeycomb geometries. It has been observed that shock velocity varies
   almost linearly with impact velocity. Using this fundamental relation,
   we derive the stress-impact velocity Hugoniot from the conservation law
   of momentum. The dynamic stress-strain states of a regular hexagonal
   honeycomb obtained from the FE simulations show a good agreement with
   the Hugoniot predictions. It is shown that the dynamic stress-strain
   states for various impact velocities lie on a unique curve, which is
   different from the quasi-static stress-strain response. The local
   strains behind the shock front are significantly lowered in the presence
   of an entrapped gas, and the stresses behind the shock front are higher
   as compared to the case where there is no entrapped gas. The variation
   of the plateau stresses with the cell morphology has been explained, and
   correlated to the energy absorption capacity of the honeycombs. A new
   method to characterize the energy absorption capacity of honeycombs is
   proposed, and the performance of various honeycombs has been compared
   through the dissipation performance parameter.}},

Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{537-546}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of anti-trichial honeycombs under quasi-static
   compression with large deformation are studied by both experiments and
   theoretical analysis. It is shown that the cells' collapse of the
   anti-trichiral honeycombs dominated by both the ligaments' rotation
   around the plastic hinges and the rotation of cylinders. The theoretical
   analytical models are established to predict both the NPR and the
   crushing stress of the anti-trichiral honeycombs. The analytical
   predictions show good agreement with the experimental results. It is
   shown that the crushing stress of the honeycomb decreases with the
   ligament's length ratio L/r, but increases with the wall thickness. As
   for the honeycomb's Poisson's ratio, it increases with the ligaments'
   length ratio and decreases with the honeycomb's deformation, while the
   wall thickness has no influence on it. The anti-trichiral honeycomb
   exhibits NPR effect only when the ligament's length ratio less than 5.5.
   However, when the ligaments' length ratio is more than 10, the
   anti-trichiral honeycomb shows positive Poisson's ratio during the whole
   compression. When the ligaments' length ratio is in the range of 5.5
   through 10, the anti-trichiral honeycomb appears NPR under small
   deformation, but positive Poisson's ratio under large deformation. These
   light up a refer to the design of the anti-trichiral honeycombs.}},

Abstract = {{The prediction of heave in unsaturated, expansive soils has historically
   been studied primarily as a one-dimensional type analysis. This paper
   proposes a methodology that can be used for the prediction of one-,
   two-, or three-dimensional heave. It is suggested that negative
   pore-water pressures (i.e., soil suctions) can be estimated through a
   saturated-unsaturated seepage analysis. The results of the seepage
   analysis are then used as input for the prediction of displacements in a
   stress-deformation analysis. The formulation of the governing partial
   differential equations for both seepage and stress-deformation is based
   on the general theory of unsaturated soils using two independent stress
   state variables. The elasticity parameter functions required for a
   stress-deformation analysis can be calculated from various tests,
   including conventional one-dimensional oedometer tests. The proposed
   method is studied and tested against data collected on a case history
   involving a slab-on-ground floor on Regina clay. The predicted results
   from the two-dimensional analysis agree well with the measured data in
   terms of both total vertical displacements and final water contents in
   the soil. The results of a parametric study are also presented to show
   the effect of measured soil parameters (i.e., swelling index and initial
   void ratio) and assumed parameters (i.e., Poisson's ratio and
   coefficient of earth pressure at rest) on the predicted displacements.}},

Abstract = {{The neotropical stink bug Euschistus heros is the predominant and most
   important insect pest affecting soybean cultivation. Knowledge of the
   spatial pattern of the pest in an area is critical to understanding its
   behavior. The objective of this work was to study the spatial
   distribution of E. heros in transgenic soybean cultivars of different
   maturing cycles. The experiments were conducted in the seasons 2013/14
   and 2014/15 in FCAV/UNESP, Jaboticabal, SP. Three fields were selected,
   and each was marked an area of 8.000 m(2) (0.8 ha), with each area
   divided into 80 portions of 100 m(2) (10 m x 10 m). The transgenic
   soybean cultivars of different maturing cycles were: SYN 1365 RR
   (early), M 7908 RR (average), and BRS Valiosa RR (late). Samples were
   taken weekly using a beat sheet, registering the number of nymphs and
   adults of E. heros. To study the dispersion of E. heros, the following
   indices were used: variance/mean ratio, Morisita index, Green
   coefficient, and the exponent k of the negative binomial distribution.
   For studies of special distribution models of E. heros, adjustments of
   Poisson distribution and negative binomial distribution were tested. The
   spatial distribution of nymphs and adults was aggregated for all the
   cultivars studied, indicating that cultivars did not alter the
   distribution behavior of E. heros.}},

Abstract = {{Folds are marvellous features of mountain terrains, but despite
   extensive research, many fundamental problems have still not been
   solved. In terrains of sandstone, fold hinges are rarely straight lines
   but curved, forming a pattern characterized by doubly plunging,
   elliptical dome-and-basin structures. Such structures are an obvious
   manifestation of coeval or successive shortening deformation in two
   orthogonal principal directions in the horizontal plane. Based on an
   anatomic investigation of the fold pattern of sandstone beds at the
   rocky beaches of Saint-Jean-Port-Joli (Quebec, Canada), we propose that
   the doubly plunging folds may result from a transition from a plane
   deformation to a constrictional deformation due to auxetic effects of
   quartz-rich rocks. The sandstone beds possessed potentially such
   negative values of Poisson's ratio that, when placed under compression
   in one direction, they become contracted in the transverse direction,
   producing a series of doubly plunging folds. Further work is needed to
   approve or disapprove the interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{In axial compressor design for aero engines high system efficiency and
   operational stability are two main objectives. Both depend on
   clearance-induced losses. Previous investigations at the Institute have
   resulted in a passive clearance controlled compressor design using
   additively manufactured auxetic casing structures. The extension to an
   active clearance controlled device to keep an approximately constant tip
   gap ratio during the entire flight mission is currently investigated.
   Constructive on these deliverables, the implementation of tip blowing
   casing treatment modification in a double-walled compressor casing
   including an auxetic inner structure is covered in this work and
   studiedfor maximum load conditions by means ofFinite Element Analysis.
   The idea to supplement the current auxetic casing construction with
   casing treatment modification emerges from the aspiration to generate
   further stability improvements in the high-pressure domain and the
   exploitation ofthe design freedom provided by additive manufacturing.
   Key issues addressed in this work by conducting parameter studies are
   casing treatment positioning and corresponding structural correlations
   depending on circumferential quantity. The evaluation section
   concentrates mainly on the calculated stress level associated with tip
   blowing casing treatments because this value is crucial for prospective
   fatigue predictions. In order to compare the results, the auxetic casing
   structure without casing treatment modification serves as reference.
   Promising solutions for local stress reductions are also proposed and
   discussed.
   From a structural mechanics perspective, the casing treatment
   modification generates very high and comparable notch stress levels at
   each position. Placing the casing treatments at the framework ofthe
   auxetic cells and splitting the inner casing ring results in tolerable
   stress levels.}},

Abstract = {{Bending of an annular thick plate resting on a ring support is analyzed
   under the action of power-law axisymmetric loading. A single governing
   differential equation for the Mindlin plate theory is derived. By
   solving associated boundary value problem, the optimal support location
   is determined to achieve minimizing the maximum deflection of a
   moderately thick circular or annular plate. The minimum sag of a heavy
   solid circular plate with or without the center support under
   self-weight is also analyzed. In addition to applied loading and the
   restraint of plate's rims, the optimal location of the ring support is
   also related to Poisson's ratio and the ratio of inner-to-outer radius.
   Auxetic plates with negative Poisson's ratio require larger ring
   support's radius, and conventional plates require smaller ring support's
   radius. Usually, the optimal support location is closer to the outer rim
   and far to the inner rim for a plate of self-weight. The obtained
   results are useful in safety design of circular or annular plates under
   complicated loading.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the influence of out-of-plane ply waviness on elastic
   properties of composite laminates subjected to uniaxial loading is
   investigated. A three-dimensional analytical method based on the
   classical lamination theory is developed to quantitatively determine the
   effective elastic constants of thick composite laminates with ply
   waviness. Various influential factors associated with ply waviness, such
   as the waviness geometry, the off-axis angle, the extent of wavy region,
   and the waviness pattern, are incorporated in the multi-parameter model.
   Analytical results for the Young's moduli, the shear moduli and the
   Poisson's ratios of wavy fiber composite laminates are obtained and
   discussed for a specific range of fiber volume fractions and two
   different lay-ups. Negative Poisson's ratios are found for
   unidirectional laminates nested wavy ply/plies. The present method
   provides a useful and effective tool to evaluate the effects of
   out-of-plane ply waviness on three-dimensional elastic properties of
   composite laminates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional(2D) materials are considered excellent candidates for
   achieving a highly efficient photocatalyst. Herein, we report a novel 2D
   aluminum nitride monolayer (th-AlN) as a potential photocatalyst
   material, possessing robust energetic, dynamical, thermal, and
   mechanical stability as well as strong stability in aqueuos conditions.
   The monolayer is an indirect band gap semiconductor at its equilibrium
   state and can induce an indirect-to-direct band gap transition under a
   very small strain (-4\%). The band edge positions fit perfectly the
   water oxidation and reduction redox potentials. The monolayer exhibits
   strong visible-ultraviolet light absorption, which is favorable for the
   efficient utilization of sunlight. The excellent electron transport
   ability including high and directionally anisotropic carrier mobility
   (10(4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) leads to the rapid separation of electron-hole
   pairs, retards the recombination of electron-hole pairs, and greatly
   improves the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the monolayer
   exhibits exceptional mechanical properties including ultrahigh ideal
   strength (40\%) outperforming graphene, good flexibility, and mechanical
   anisotropy. Remarkably, the negative Poisson's ratio makes th-AlN a
   promising candidate for auxetic materials. With these outstanding
   properties, th-AlN can be considered as a promising candidate for
   potential application in the fields of electronics, optoelectronics, and
   nanomechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibit a unique characteristic due to the altered

   Finite element and analytical approach for various geometrical

   domain in which auxetic material is of interest for variations in
   geometrical parameters. It is evident that mechanical properties of the
   material could be controlled by changing the base wall angle of the

Abstract = {{One of the methods in understanding the real microstructure of auxetic
   material is by separating it into several simplified structures that
   have distinct mechanisms. Among those simplified structures are chiral
   and re-entrant structures. This paper adapts a 2D re-entrant structure
   for a 3D auxetic structure. A re-entrant structure is chosen due to its
   fundamental characteristics underlying the main characteristics of
   auxetic materials. The energy methods of solid mechanics along with
   numerical methods are used to study the fundamental concept of auxetic
   materials. Understanding the characteristics of the re-entrant structure
   will lead to the better comprehension of other structures of auxetic
   materials, which will eventually contribute to the advance of research
   in this new class of materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A Novel Model Incorporating Geomechanics for a Horizontal Well in a
   Naturally Fractured Reservoir}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Fracture aperture of a fractured reservoir can be affected by both
   matrix elasticity and fracture compressibility when the reservoir
   pressure decreases, namely stress sensitivity. An elasticity parameter
   coupling Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio was introduced to reflect
   this geomechanical behavior, and a new model incorporating geomechanics
   was developed to analyze the flow behavior of a horizontal well in a
   naturally fractured reservoir. Pressure solutions for two
   casesuniform-flux and infinite-conductivitywere derived, respectively.
   For the uniform-flux case, the effect of dimensionless elasticity
   parameter on the pressure-drop profile becomes stronger with continuing
   production, and the profile may be like a bow. Nine flow regimes can be
   observed on the transient response of the infinite-conductivity case.
   Stress sensitivity mainly affects the late-flow period and a larger
   dimensionless elasticity parameter causes a greater pressure drop. Due
   to stress sensitivity, the pressure derivative curve exhibits an upward
   tendency in the pseudo-radial flow regime, and the slope is greater than
   1 in the pseudo-steady flow regime. For KT-I formation in the North
   Truva field, its elasticity parameter decreases with the increase of
   Young's modulus or Poisson's ratio and ranges from 8 x 10(-8) Pa-1 to
   1.1 x 10(-7) Pa-1. Meanwhile, the transient response of H519 has a
   slight negative correlation with Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in
   the pseudo-steady flow regime.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to analyze the association

   domains scores lower than the median and to compare the multiple
   logistic regression model with the multiple Poisson regression model. In
   the elderly population of four ICC in the city of Cuiaba-MT with a
   sample of 317 elderly. The main dependent variable was health
   perception, assessed through the WHOQOL-BREF with the following
   question: How satisfied are you with your health? The independent
   variables were the WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD domains scores lower than
   the median. Gross odds ratios and gross prevalence ratios. To verify the
   normal distribution of domain score data, the Shapiro test was used,
   identifying that these scores were not symmetric.
   Due to this, for the data analysis, a bivariate categorical analysis
   using crude odds ratio and crude prevalence ratio and a categorical
   multiple analysis using binary logistic regression and Poisson
   regression was considered. In this study, both models were adequate to
   the data, however the Poisson model was more accurate than the logistic
   model and with these models it was found that the domains that together
   presented risks in the perception of negative health were: the scores of
   the physical and past, present and future activities; both smaller than
   the median.}},

Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate an effective approach to enhance the output performance
   of a flexible piezoelectric energy harvester by using flexible
   electrodes with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The relationship between
   open-circuit voltage and Poisson's ratio of electrodes is established
   theoretically by deriving the analytical expression. It reveals a
   continuous increasing trend in open-circuit voltage with the decrease in
   Poisson's ratio of the electrodes. Further, graphene-assembled
   macro-film (GAMF), an NPR material with excellent flexibility and high
   conductivity, is used as the electrodes to fabricate flexible
   piezoelectric energy harvesters. Compared with the energy harvesters
   using silver electrode, the harvesters made by GAMF electrodes, with an
   NPR of -0.39, achieve nearly 1.7-times enhancement in open-circuit
   voltage and 1.6-times in short-circuit current for output performance.
   The experimental results are highly consistent with the simulation
   results, indicating that the GAMF has great prospects in developing
   flexible piezoelectric energy harvesters with enhanced electrical output
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Soft materials are being adopted in robotics in order to facilitate
   biomedical applications and in order to achieve simpler and more capable
   robots. One route to simplification is to design the robot's body using
   `smart materials' that carry the burden of control and actuation.
   Metamaterials enable just such rational design of the material
   properties. Here we present a soft robot that exploits mechanical
   metamaterials for the intrinsic synchronization of two passive clutches
   which contact its travel surface. Doing so allows it to move through an
   enclosed passage with an inchworm motion propelled by a single actuator.
   Our soft robot consists of two 3D-printed metamaterials that implement
   auxetic and normal elastic properties. The design, fabrication and
   characterization of the metamaterials are described. In addition, a
   working soft robot is presented. Since the synchronization mechanism is
   a feature of the robot's material body, we believe that the proposed
   design will enable compliant and robust implementations that scale well
   with miniaturization.}},

Abstract = {{The computation of the dispersion relations for dissipative periodic
   lattices having the attributes of metamaterials is an actual research
   topic raising the interest of researchers in the field of acoustics and
   wave propagation phenomena. We analyze in this contribution the impact
   of wave damping on the dispersion features of periodic lattices, which
   are modeled as beam-lattices. The band diagram structure and damping
   ratio are computed for different repetitive lattices, based on the
   homogenized continuum response of the initially discrete lattice
   architecture, modeled as Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic beams. Three of these
   lattices (reentrant hexagonal, chiral diamond, hexachiral lattice) are
   auxetic meta materials, since they show negative Poisson's ratio. The
   effective viscoelastic anisotropic continuum behavior of the lattices is
   first computed in terms of the homogenized stiffness and viscosity
   matrices, based on the discrete homogenization technique. The dynamical
   equations of motion are obtained for an equivalent homogenized
   micropolar continuum evaluated based on the homogenized properties, and
   the dispersion relation and damping ratio are obtained by inserting an
   harmonic plane waves Ansatz into these equations. The comparison of the
   acoustic properties obtained in the low frequency range for the four
   considered lattices shows that auxetic lattices attenuate waves at lower
   frequencies compared to the classical hexagonal lattice. The diamond
   chiral lattice shows the best attenuation properties of harmonic waves
   over the entire Brillouin zone, and the hexachiral lattice presents
   better acoustic properties than the reentrant hexagonal lattice. The
   range of validity of the effective continuum obtained by the discrete
   homogenization has been assessed by comparing the frequency band
   structure of this continuum with that obtained by a Floquet-Bloch
   analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of inhibition on the firing variability is examined in this
   paper using the biologically-inspired temporal noisy-leaky integrator
   (TNLI) neuron model. The TNLI incorporates hyperpolarising inhibition
   with negative current pulses of controlled shapes and it also separates
   dendritic from somatic integration. The firing variability is observed
   by looking at the coefficient of ``variation (C-V) (standard
   deviation/mean interspike interval) as a function of the mean interspike
   interval of firing (Deltat(M)) and by comparing the results with the
   theoretical curve for random spike trains, as well as looking at the
   interspike interval (ISI) histogram distributions. The results show that
   with 80\% inhibition, firing at high rates (up to 200 Hz) is nearly
   consistent with a Poisson-type variability, which complies with the
   analysis of cortical neuron firing recordings by Softky and Koch
   {[}1993, J. Neurosci. 13(1) 334-530]. We also demonstrate that the
   mechanism by which inhibition increases the C-V values is by introducing
   more short intervals in the firing pattern as indicated by a small
   initial hump at the beginning of the ISI histogram distribution. The use
   of stochastic inputs and the separation of the dendritic and somatic
   integration which we model in TNLI, also affect the high firing, near
   Poisson-type (explained in the paper) variability produced. We have also
   found that partial dendritic reset increases slightly the firing
   variability especially at short ISIs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland

Title = {{Study in circular auxetic structures for efficiency enhancement in
   piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Piezoelectric (PZT) components are one of the most popular elements in
   vibration sensing and also energy harvesting. They are very well
   established, cost effective and available in different geometries
   however there are still several challenges in their application
   particularly in vibration energy harvesting. They are normally
   narrow-band elements and work in high-frequency range. Their efficiency
   and power extraction density are also generally low compared with
   different electromagnetic techniques. Auxetic structures are proposed
   here to enhance efficiency of the piezoelectric circular patches in
   vibration energy harvesting. These kinds of patches namely PZT buzzers
   are inexpensive (less than 10 USD) elements and easily available. Two
   novel circular auxetic substrates are proposed to improve power
   extraction capacity of the conventional piezoelectric buzzers. Negative
   Poison's ratio of the proposed meta-structure helps in efficiency
   enhancement. The concept is introduced, analyzed and verified through
   the finite element modeling and experimental testing. The idea is proved
   to work by comparing the harvested electrical power in the auxetic
   design against the conventional plain system. A parametric study is then
   carried out and effects of important electrical and geometrical
   parameters as well as the material property on the power extraction
   efficiency are assessed to arrive at optimum parameters. It is shown
   that by employing the auxetic design, a remarkable improvement in the
   harvested power is achievable. It is shown that for the two proposed
   auxetic designs, at the resonance frequency, we could reach to 10.2 and
   13.3 magnification factor with respect to the plain energy harvester.
   Another important feature is that the resonant frequency in these new
   designs is very much lower than the conventional resonators. Results of
   this study can open a new path to application of inexpensive PZT buzzers
   in large-scale vibration energy harvesting.}},

Abstract = {{Using molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, the mechanical properties of a
   buckypaper/epoxy composite were calculated. In order to simulate a large
   model within a large enough timescale, a general MD code fully
   implemented on graphical processing units (GPUs) was developed. The
   code, which enables the simulation of large systems with about five
   hundreds speed up in simulation time relative to a single CPU core, is
   capable of running on CUDA enabled GPUs. In this study the
   buckpaper/epoxy composite consists of single wall carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs), epoxy resin (EPON-862) and the curing agent
   diethyltoluenediamine (DETDA). Next, the mechanical properties of
   buckypaper/epoxy composite, namely elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio,
   were studied through the simulation of a set of tension tests. For the
   first time directional properties of this material is calculated. A
   comparison with previously published data is also included. The results
   prove that the proposed procedure is suitable for investigating the
   mechanical properties of the buckypaper/epoxy composites. In addition,
   the results show a negative Poisson ratio and high modulus of elasticity
   for the buckypaper/epoxy composites, which proves the application of
   such material in producing artificial muscles, and advanced composites
   in aviation industries, respectively. Finally, a study on the failure
   mechanisms of the material is conducted and the integrity of the results
   was checked by the available experimental and analytical data.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the electromechanical coupling of auxetic materials offers
   unique opportunities to enhance the sensitivity of piezoresistive
   sensors. Reports on the auxetic behavior of random fiber networks have
   been relatively scarce due to their less pronounced Poisson's expansions
   than other auxetic designs adapting periodically arranged structures. In
   this study, the auxetic response of hierarchical pulp-carbon nanotube
   networks is tailored through the localized tensional micro-fracture
   initiated by water-printing. The interfacial junctions among multiwalled
   carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and cellulose fibers are disintegrated and
   reorganized to induce the buckling of a wet CNT paper composite (CPC)
   network. The Poisson's ratio of -49.5 is achieved at the water-printed
   region. The resulting piezoresistive properties of CPC sensors exhibit
   high sensitivity (3.3 kPa(-1)) over a wide dynamic range (6-500 000 Pa).
   The novel auxetic behavior of water-printed CPC paves the way for high
   performance and inexpensive wearable devices.}},

Abstract = {{We examine in detail the activity coefficient of higher-charge
   electrolytes, which, in dilute solutions, can display negative
   deviations from the Debye-Huckel limiting law instead of the usual
   positive deviations typical of lower-charge electrolytes. This fact is
   of considerable relevance for scientists concerned with extrapolation to
   infinite dilution of thermodynamic and kinetic quantities. It is shown
   that this ``strange{''} behavior originates merely from the
   electrostatic interactions between each ion and all other ions, with no
   necessity of hypothesizing the presence of chemical association; these
   negative deviations, indeed, are predicted even at the level of the
   ``primitive model{''} (ions assumed as charged, unpolarizable, rigid
   spheres inside an unstructured, isotropic, dielectric fluid). Three
   different approximations for the behavior of the primitive model of
   low-charge and high-charge electrolytes are tested, in addition to the
   Debye-Huckel theory; i.e. IPBE (a numerical accurate integration of the
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation), the Mayer theory of the electrolytes in the
   so-called DHLL + B2 approximation, and the Bjerrum theory. In the
   Supporting Information, the fundamentals of the respective algorithms
   are reported, and the effects produced by the differences of size
   between cations and anions, are also examined.}},

Abstract = {{The wave propagation in sandwich beams with cellular core is analyzed
   and controlled. The material properties of cellular cores are highly
   dependent on the geometry of the cell composing the honeycomb structure.
   Core materials of different geometry placed periodically along the beam
   length introduce the proper impedance mismatch necessary to impede the
   propagation of waves along the beam.
   A theoretical model is developed to describe the wave propagation
   characteristics and the vibration of the sandwich beam. The model is
   used to obtain the transfer matrix for a unit cell of the considered
   periodic structure, which is then used to analyze the dynamics of wave
   propagation along the beam. The transfer matrix is also properly recast
   in order to obtain the dynamic stiffness matrix and formulate a spectral
   finite element model for the periodic sandwich beam. The spectral finite
   element model employs dynamic shape functions obtained from the solution
   of the distributed parameter model, which allow predicting the dynamic
   behavior of the structure with a significantly reduced number of
   elements as compared to conventional FEM.
   The transfer matrix of the sandwich beam identifies the location of the
   frequency bands where travelling waves are attenuated. The influence of
   core geometry and periodicity on the location and extension of these
   stop bands is assessed through a series of simulations. The effect of
   the periodicity of the structure is also evaluated by considering the
   vibration response of a clamped free beam excited by the harmonic motion
   of the base. The results demonstrate the simplicity and the
   effectiveness of the proposed treatment whereby the transmission of
   waves and the vibration over specified frequency bands can be
   significantly reduced without requiring additional passive or active
   control devices. The unique characteristics of cellular solids therefore
   can be used to design light-weight composite panels that behave as
   mechanical filters. The filtering capabilities of such passive composite
   panels may be easily changed and optimized to reduce their
   transmissibility over a desired frequency range without compromising the
   size and the weight of the structure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a group of auxetic-inspired material structures
   that can transform into various shapes upon compression. We developed
   four cellular-based material structure units composed of rigid plates
   and elastic/rotary hinges. Different compositions of these units lead to
   a variety of tunable shape changing possibilities, such as uniform
   scaling, shearing, bending and rotating. By tessellating those
   transformations together, we can create various higher level
   transformations for product design. In the paper, we first give a
   geometrical and numerical description of the units' configuration and
   their degrees of freedom. An interactive simulation tool is developed
   for users to input designed structures and preview the transformation.
   Finally we present three application prototypes that utilize our
   proposed structures. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{For a crystalline material, Poisson's ratio depends upon two orthogonal
   directions, one corresponding to the applied uniaxial stress and another
   for the resulting transverse strain. Interest in directions that yield a
   negative value leads to a consideration of extreme values and associated
   directions. Another indicator of a negative Poisson's ratio is the Lame
   compliance, defined as the transverse strain response to a unit uniaxial
   stress. Where this quantity is positive, Poisson's ratio is negative and
   it is natural to associate a near minimum value of the ratio with a
   maximum of the Lame compliance. Moreover, the stationary directions
   associated with the compliance bear a clearer relationship to the
   crystallographic directions than those of the ratio. Indeed, many of
   these directions are not dependent upon the elastic constants within a
   given crystal symmetry class. In the case of alpha-cristobalite, the
   maximum value of the Lame compliance is associated with such invariant
   stationary points. In the present work, we describe the invariant
   stationary directions and touch on a few of the simplest
   material-dependent stationary points.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness of sampling plans by attributes based on mixture
   distributions characterising microbial clustering in food}},
Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{50-60}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{As in many cases, pathogenic microorganisms contaminate the food
   material as clusters or group of individual cells; the effectiveness of
   sampling plans based on mixture distributions representing bacterial
   agglomeration was assessed. In general, sampling plans that do not take
   into account such consideration lead to higher probabilities of
   accepting defective lots. Since quite often no scientific data are
   available in order to determine the degree of over-dispersion or
   clustering of the target microorganisms, in this theoretical study we
   compare the variance-to-mean ratio and the reciprocal of the exponent k
   of the negative binomial distribution (NB) as measures of dispersion.
   The mixture Poisson-logarithmic (Plog) model is proposed as a special
   case of the NB distribution, where the bacterial clusters are Poisson
   distributed while the individuals in each cluster follow a logarithmic
   distribution. In order to describe microbial data characterised by an
   excess of zero counts (1-pi, we assess the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP)
   and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distributions as alternative
   statistical models. The Operating Characteristic (OC) curves generated
   on the basis of the zero-inflated distributions were compared for fixed
   values of the variance-to-mean ratio and the parameter it at any mean
   level of contamination and sample weight adopted. The results show that
   assuming fixed 1/k and it for the NB and ZIP distributions,
   respectively, both models converge to a Poisson distribution at the
   producer's quality level. In contrast, the consumer's quality level is
   highly affected by assuming fixed values of 1/k and pi since it
   increases. The OC curves generated for the NB and ZIP distributions
   assuming fixed values of the variance-to-mean ratio at any mean level of
   contamination and sample weight adopted, reveal that both the consumer's
   and producer's quality level are affected, as they both increase. Within
   the ZINB distribution, a separate investigation is conducted to
   determine which parameters are mostly responsible for describing
   microbial over-dispersion. As a general conclusion, for the design of
   sampling plans based on any statistical distribution, OC curves that
   reflect microbial agglomeration should be constructed considering that
   variance is not constant but dependant on the level of microbial
   concentration of the lot. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Growing biological media develop residual stresses to make compatible
   elastic and inelastic growth-induced deformations, which in turn remodel
   the tissue properties modifying the actual elastic moduli and
   transforming an initially isotropic and homogeneous material into a
   spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic one. This process is crucial in
   solid tumor growth mechanobiology, the residual stresses directly
   influencing tumor aggressiveness, nutrients walkway, necrosis and
   angiogenesis. With this in mind, we here analyze the problem of a
   hyperelastic sphere undergoing finite heterogeneous growth, in cases of
   different boundary conditions and spherical symmetry. By following an
   analytical approach, we obtain the explicit expression of the tangent
   elasticity tensor at any point of the material body as a function of the
   prescribed growth, by involving a small-on-large procedure and
   exploiting exact solutions for layered media. The results allowed to
   gain several new insights into how growth-guided mechanical stresses and
   remodeling processes can influence the solid tumor development. In
   particular, we highlight that-under hypotheses consistent with
   mechanical and physiological conditions-auxetic (negative Poisson ratio)
   transformations of the elastic response of selected growing mass
   districts could occur and contribute to explain some not yet completely
   understood phenomena associated to solid tumors. The general approach
   proposed in the present work could be also helpfully employed to
   conceive composite materials where ad hoc pre-stress distributions can
   be designed to obtain auxetic or other selected mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel cellular metamaterial constructed from Origami
   building blocks based on Miura-ori fold. The proposed cellular
   metamaterial exhibits unusual properties some of which stemming from the
   inherent properties of its Origami building blocks, and others
   manifesting due to its unique geometrical construction and architecture.
   These properties include foldability with two fully-folded
   configurations, auxeticity (i.e., negative Poisson's ratio),
   bistability, and self-locking of Origami building blocks to construct
   load-bearing cellular metamaterials. The kinematics and force response
   of the cellular metamaterial during folding were studied to investigate
   the underlying mechanisms resulting in its unique properties using
   analytical modeling and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Confined expansion of polymer spheres coated with a metal slurry is a
   way of producing cellular microstructures that range from sintered
   hollow spheres in the unexpanded case to sintered polyhedra with nearly
   flat cell walls in the fully expanded case. In this paper, the expansion
   process is simulated by the finite element method for a face-centered
   cubic arrangement of spheres. Unit cell models for structural analysis
   are obtained from different stages of the expansion simulation. On the
   basis of these models, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio along the
   axes of cubic symmetry are predicted for different relative densities
   and different degrees of expansion. It is shown that the elastic
   stiffness is increasing monotonically with increasing confined expansion
   of the spheres. Poisson's ratio is predicted as being negative for low
   degrees of expansion and positive for high degrees of expansion.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{257}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The folded geometry has successfully been transformed into auxetic woven
   fabric in the literature. However, the influences of the microgeometric
   parameters on the macroscopic behavior have not been addressed yet.
   Herein, several key microgeometric parameters for the folded geometry
   are identified and the mechanical behaviors of the folded structure are
   preliminarily studied using the finite element method. The results show
   that the folded structure can be unfolded in both longitudinal and
   transverse directions when stretched and thus achieve a negative
   Poisson's ratio. More interestingly, another fantastic property of
   tension-bending coupling effect is found in the folded structure and a
   competition exists between the auxeticity and the tension-bending
   coupling effect. This is the first time to report a structure that can
   stimulatingly have the auxeticity and the tension-bending coupling
   effect. Due to the unique properties, the folded geometry is very
   promising in some important fields; for example, the textiles, civil
   engineering, and auto industry. The present work may provide a good
   guide for the design and application of the folded structure.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) materials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   attract considerable attention because of their exotic mechanical
   properties. We propose a new 2D material, monolayer GaPS4, which shows
   NPR for both in-plane (-0.033) and out-of-plane (-0.62) directions. Such
   coexistence of NPR in two distinct directions could be explained by its
   corner- and edge-shared tetrahedra pucker structure. GaPS4 has an
   ultralow cleavage energy of 0.23 J m(-2) according to our calculation,
   such that exfoliation of the bulk material is feasible for the
   preparation of mono- and few-layer GaPS4. Direct wide band gap of 3.55
   eV and moderate electron mobility have been revealed in monolayer GaPS4,
   while the direct gap feature is robust within a strain range of -6\% to
   6\%. These findings render 2D GaPS4 a promising candidate for
   applications in nanoelectronics and low-dimensional electromechanical
   devices.}},

Title = {{A nonlinear molecular mechanics model for graphene subjected to large
   in-plane deformations}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{167}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we present a fully nonlinear stick-and-spring model for
   graphene subjected to in-plane deformations. The constitutive behaviors
   of sticks and springs are defined, respectively, by the modified Morse
   potential and a nonlinear bond angle potential. The equilibrium
   equations of the representative cell are written considering large
   displacements of the nodes (atoms) and the stability of the solutions is
   assessed using an energy criterion. The solutions for the uniaxial load
   cases along armchair and zigzag directions show that graphene is
   isotropic for small deformations, while it exhibits anisotropy when
   subjected to large deformations. Moreover, graphene shows a negative
   Poisson's ratio after a critical value of deformation. In the case of
   equibiaxial load, multiple solutions of the equilibrium are found and
   graphene can experience asymmetric deformations despite the symmetry of
   the external loads. The nonlinear formulation of the equilibrium is then
   linearized by introducing the hypothesis of small displacements. The
   expressions of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are derived. (c) 2021

Abstract = {{RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is the current method of choice for
   characterizing transcriptomes and quantifying gene expression changes.
   This next generation sequencing-based method provides unprecedented
   depth and resolution. The negative binomial (NB) probability
   distribution has been shown to be a useful model for frequencies of
   mapped RNA-Seq reads and consequently provides a basis for statistical
   analysis of gene expression. Negative binomial exact tests are available
   for two-group comparisons but do not extend to negative binomial
   regression analysis, which is important for examining gene expression as
   a function of explanatory variables and for adjusted group comparisons
   accounting for other factors. We address the adequacy of available
   large-sample tests for the small sample sizes typically available from
   RNA-Seq studies and consider a higher-order asymptotic (HOA) adjustment
   to likelihood ratio tests. We demonstrate that 1) the HOA-adjusted
   likelihood ratio test is practically indistinguishable from the exact
   test in situations where the exact test is available, 2) the type I
   error of the HOA test matches the nominal specification in regression
   settings we examined via simulation, and 3) the power of the likelihood
   ratio test does not appear to be affected by the HOA adjustment. This
   work helps clarify the accuracy of the unadjusted likelihood ratio test
   and the degree of improvement available with the HOA adjustment.
   Furthermore, the HOA test may be preferable even when the exact test is
   available because it does not require ad hoc library size adjustments.}},

   atomic configuration, penta-graphene has an unusual negative Poisson's
   ratio and ultrahigh ideal strength that can even outperform graphene.
   Furthermore, unlike graphene that needs to be functionalized for opening
   a band gap, penta-graphene possesses an intrinsic quasi-direct band gap
   as large as 3.25 eV, close to that of ZnO and GaN. Equally important,
   penta-graphene can be exfoliated from T12-carbon. When rolled up, it can
   form pentagon-based nanotubes which are semiconducting, regardless of
   their chirality. When stacked in different patterns, stable 3D twin
   structures of T12-carbon are generated with band gaps even larger than
   that of T12-carbon. The versatility of penta-graphene and its
   derivatives are expected to have broad applications in nanoelectronics
   and nanomechanics.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the electrical heating performance by auxetic pattern,
   re-entrant honeycomb (RE), chiral truss (CT), honeycomb (HN), and truss
   (TR), using graphene/PLA (Polylactic acid) filament, were manufactured
   by CFDM (conveyor fused deposition modelling) 3D printer. In addition,
   HN and TR, which was indicated to have an excellent electrical heating
   property, were selected to verify the feasibility of applying fabric
   heating elements. The result of morphology was that the number of struts
   constituting the unit cell and the connected points were TR < HN < CT <
   RE. It was also influenced by the surface resistivity and electrical
   heating performance. RE, which has the highest number of struts
   constituting the unit cell and the relative density, had the highest
   value of surface resistivity, and the lowest value was found in the
   opposite TR. In the electrical heating performance of samples, the heat
   distribution of RE was limited even when the applied voltage was
   increased. However, HN and TR were diffused throughout the sample. In
   addition, the surface temperature of RE, CT, HN, and TR was about 72.4
   degrees C, 83.1 degrees C, 94.9 degrees C, and 85.9, respectively as
   applied at 30 V. When the HN and TR were printed on cotton fabric, the
   surface resistivity of HN/cotton and TR/cotton was about 10(3) omega/sq,
   which showed conductive material. The results of electrical heating
   properties indicated that the heat distribution of HN/cotton showed only
   in the region where power was supplied, but the TR/cotton was gradually
   expanded and presented stable electric heating properties. When 30 V was
   applied, the surface temperature of both samples showed more than 80
   degrees C, and the shape was maintained stably due to the high thermal
   conductivity of the cotton fabric. Therefore, this study ensured that HN
   and TR show excellent electrical heating performance among four types of
   auxetic patterns with continuity.}},

Abstract = {{The Japanese art of turning flat sheets into three dimensional intricate
   structures, origami, has inspired design of mechanical metamaterials.
   Mechanical metamaterials are artificially engineered materials with
   uncommon properties. Miura-ori is a remarkable origami folding pattern
   with metamaterial properties and a wide range of applications. In this
   study, by dislocating the zigzag strips of a Miura-ori pattern along the
   joining ridges, we create a class of one-degree of freedom (DOF)
   cellular mechanical metamaterials. The unit cell of the patterns
   comprises two zigzag strips surrounding a hole with a parallelogram
   shape. We show that dislocating zigzag strips of the Miura-ori along the
   joining ridges preserves and/or tunes the outstanding properties of the
   Miura-ori. The introduced materials are lighter than their corresponding
   Miura-ori sheets due to the presence of holes in the patterns. Moreover,
   they are amenable to similar modifications available for Miura-ori which
   make them appropriate for a wide range of applications across the length
   scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{117}},

Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Galfenol (Fe(x)Ga100-(x)), a magnetostrictive alloy (3/2 lambda 110-400
   ppm) of Iron and Gallium exhibits an in-plane auxetic response in the <
   110 > crystallographic direction. Negative Poisson's ratios have been
   observed in response to application of stress fields, where values of as
   low as -0.7 have been reported for compositions of greater than roughly
   20\% Ga {[}Zhang et al., J. Appl. Phys. 108(2), 023513 (2010)] and in
   response to application of magnetic fields, where values of as low as
   -2.5 have been reported to be expected for compositions of less than
   roughly 20\% Ga {[}G. Raghunath and A. B. Flatau, IEEE Trans. Magn. (in
   press)]. Several models have been proposed to understand these two
   distinct phenomena. Galfenol samples with less than 20\% Ga also exhibit
   an unusual response to an increasing magnetic field applied along the <
   110 > direction. The longitudinal strain which increases initially with
   applied field experiences a dip (until similar to 10 mT) before
   increasing again to reach saturation. The transverse strain increases
   and reaches a maximum value (at the same field of similar to 10 mT) and
   then drops from the maximum by 5\%-10\% as magnetic saturation is
   approached {[}G. Raghunath and A. B. Flatau, IEEE Trans. Magn. (in
   press)]. This work deals with discussing the evolution of magnetic
   domains in a 16 at.\% Ga single crystal Galfenol sample when subjected
   to magnetic fields in the < 110 > direction in the (100) plane. The
   magnetic domains on the surface of mechanically polished Galfenol
   samples were imaged using Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect microscopy.
   Simultaneously, the strains along the longitudinal and transverse < 110
   > directions were recorded using a bi-directional strain gauge rosette
   mounted on the unpolished bottom surface of the planar samples. The
   energy from the applied magnetic field is expected to grow the < 110 >
   oriented domains at the expense of domains oriented along all other
   directions. But since the plane has an easy < 100 > axis, we expect the
   domains to orient along the easy direction before saturating along the
   applied magnetic field direction. A correlation between the images
   recorded and the strains observed will be used to understand this shift
   of domains and bump in strain at low fields. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Title = {{Modelling size-dependent bending, buckling and vibrations of 2D

Abstract = {{The present work is devoted to the modelling of strongly size-dependent
   bending, buckling and vibration phenomena of 2D triangular lattices with
   the aid of a simplified first strain gradient elasticity continuum
   theory. As a start, the corresponding generalized Bernoulli-Euler and
   Timoshenko sandwich beam models are derived. The effective elastic
   moduli corresponding to the classical theory of elasticity are defined
   by means of a computational homogenization technique. The two additional
   length scale parameters involved in the models, in turn, are validated
   by matching the lattice response in benchmark problems for static
   bending and free vibrations calibrating the strain energy and inertia
   gradient parameters, respectively. It is demonstrated as well that the
   higher-order material parameters do not depend on the problem type,
   boundary conditions or the specific beam formulation. From the
   application point of view, it is first shown that the bending rigidity,
   critical buckling load and eigenfrequencies strongly depend on the
   lattice microstructure and these dependencies are captured by the
   generalized Bernoulli-Euler beam model. The relevance of the Timoshenko
   beam model is then addressed in the context of thick beams and sandwich
   beams. Applications to auxetic strut lattices demonstrate a significant
   increase in the stiffness of the metamaterial combined with a clear
   decrease in mass. Furthermore, with the introduced generalized beam
   finite elements, essential savings in the computational costs in
   computational structural analysis can be achieved. For engineering
   applications of architectured materials or structures with a
   microstructure utilizing triangular lattices, generalized mechanical
   properties are finally provided in a form of a design table for a wide
   range of mass densities. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigated the elastic and electronic properties of
   hexagonal Al5Mo and Al5W intermetallics using the first-principle
   method. In both phases, the structural, elastic and electronic
   properties showed the substantial pressure dependent behaviors. For
   formation enthalpies, they were both negative to indicate their
   stability at the ground state thermodynamically. In comparison, Al5Mo
   has the superior stability over Al5W owing to its more negative Hi.
   Elastically, the calculated elastic constants can satisfy Born's
   criteria from 0 to 40 GPa, suggesting their mechanical stability. With
   the increasing pressures, the elastic constants exhibited linearly
   rising tendencies. Using elastic constants, the bulk modulus (B), shear
   modulus (G) and Young's modulus (E) were derived using the
   Voigt-Reuss-Hill method. All these moduli displayed the increasing
   behaviors with the growing pressures. The analysis of BAG ratio and
   Poisson's ratio indicated that the Al5Mo and Al5W should be brittle at
   0-40 GPa. Electronically, both compounds were suggested to possess
   metallic behavior through the DOS (density of states) analysis. Under
   pressures, the shapes of peaks and pseudogaps showed few changes,
   suggesting Al5Mo and Al5W has kept structurally stable up to 40 GPa. (C)

Abstract = {{Tumour multiplicity is a frequently measured phenotype in animal studies
   of cancer biology. Poisson variation of this measurement represents a
   biological and statistical reference point that is usually violated,
   even in highly controlled experiments, owing to sources of variation in
   the stochastic process of tumour formation. A recent experiment on
   murine intestinal tumours presented conditions which seem to generate
   Poisson-distributed tumour counts. If valid, this would support a claim
   about mechanisms by which the adenomatous polyposis coli gene is
   inactivated during tumour initiation. In considering hypothesis testing
   strategies, model choice and Bayesian approaches, we quantify the
   positive evidence favouring Poisson variation in this experiment.
   Statistical techniques used include likelihood ratio testing, the Bayes
   and Akaike information criteria, negative binomial modelling, reversible
   jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and posterior predictive checking.
   The posterior approximation that is based on the Bayes information
   criterion is found to be quite accurate in this small n case-study.}},

Abstract = {{Water hammer is a transient flow in pipes that were made by quickly
   change in speed in pipes. This phenomenon can cause genuine positive and
   negative pressures in pipes and frequently with hazards in pipelines.
   Generally, water hammer makes by closing valves quickly and has one of
   the most dangerous hydrodynamic phenomena in pressurized pipelines. In
   this paper, governing equations about water hammer is numerically
   fathomed by utilizing MATLAB programing language based on the method of
   characteristic (MOC), and then the pressure variations have been studied
   by changing some effective variables such as pipes elastic modulus and
   Poisson's ratio for four pipe materials. The numerical method is based
   on the method of characteristic lines. The present results showed that
   the normalized piezometric head which is calculated in 4 statuses
   (pipe's full length, pipe's 3/4 length, pipe's 1/2 length, and pipe's
   1/4 length) is directly change with the change of elastic modulus and
   Poisson's ratio based on the pipe material,. The novelty of this study
   is to show how the materials with less elastic modulus are less likely
   to occur the water hammer than the high elastic modulus for the same
   operation condition.}},

   loading \& nbsp;}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{201}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{A B S T R A C T Auxetic double arrowhead honeycombs (DAHs) featured by
   negative Poisson's ratio is attracting increasing attention owing to
   their tailorable mechanical properties and outstanding energy absorption
   capability. In this paper, the two-dimensional metallic DAHs were
   produced and used as the sandwich cores to construct the large-size
   double arrowhead honeycomb sandwich panels (DAHSPs). A comprehensive
   experimental investigation on their dynamic responses under the paper
   tube-guided air blasts was conducted. It majorly focused on the
   influence of core configurations induced by the variation of core wall
   thickness, horizontal distance, inclined angles, thickness allocations
   and foam filling on the deformation/failure modes, associated mechanisms
   and blast resistance of the target panels. Fair comparisons among
   different design strategies were performed to evaluate their relative
   performance. Experimental results show that relative to increasing the
   core wall thickness, the decrease of horizontal distance is more
   remarkable to reduce the back face deflection upon the similar weight
   expense, whereas the effect of inclined angles is limited due to the
   competition between enhanced bending stiffness and deteriorated
   transmitted load. A more efficient approach to decrease the back face
   deformation is to enlarge the inclined angles when the core relative
   density is relatively low but to decrease the horizontal distance at a
   high level of relative density. A further improvement of blast
   resistance can be achieved by allocating more mass to the stuffer wall
   rather than the tendon one, or by introducing a gradient DAH core
   instead of the homogeneous one. Compared to adjusting the metallic DAH
   core itself, the lightweight polyurethane (PU) foam filling is a more
   competitive manner to promote the blast performance. The preliminary
   numerical simulations confirmed the shock focusing effect of the paper
   tube support and indicated reasonable agreement with the experimental
   results. The present study is supposed to shed light on the design,
   manufacturing and optimization of auxetic sandwich structures for
   protection applications.}},

   parameters. Within the frequency range from 10 to 31.5 Hz the
   transmissibility was found to be greater than 1, while it was less than
   I at all frequencies greater than 31.5 Hz. The transmissibility results
   were similar to the mean values for 80 resilient materials tested by
   Koton et. al., but were higher than the five best materials (not all
   polymeric) identified by the same researchers. In this study it has been
   suggested that the resilient behaviour of glove isolation materials
   should also be evaluated in terms of the indentation characteristics. A
   simple, linear elastic, Finite Element simulation was therefore
   performed, and the indentation results suggested that auxetic foams
   offer a significant decrease in compressive stresses with respect to
   conventional PU foams.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are gaining special interest in technical sectors due
   to their attractive mechanical behaviour. This paper reports a
   systematic investigation on missing rib design based auxetic structures
   produced from braided composites for civil engineering applications. The
   influence of various structural and material parameters on auxetic and
   mechanical properties was thoroughly investigated. The basic structures
   were also modified with straight longitudinal rods to enhance their
   strengthening potential in structural elements. Additionally, a new
   analytical model was proposed to predict Poisson's ratio through a semi
   empirical approach. Auxetic and tensile behaviours were also predicted
   using finite element analysis. The auxetic and tensile behaviours were
   observed to be more strongly dependent on their structural parameters
   than the material parameters. The developed analytical models could well
   predict the auxetic behaviour of these structures except at very low or
   high strains. Good agreement was also observed between the experimental
   results and numerical analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Two negative binomial mixed models with different dispersion

   with analogous estimates computed by an overdispersed Poisson mixed
   model. Estimators from the second negative binomial and overdispersed
   Poisson models had better frequentist properties than did those from the
   first negative binomial model. Nevertheless, application to a data set
   of number of artificial inseminations until conception in Holstein
   heifers suggested a slightly better fit of the first negative binomial
   model. A marginal likelihood ratio test indicated that the additive

Abstract = {{Shape memory alloy honeycombs are constitute a novel set of cellular

   only and in-plane Poisson's ratio equal to -1. Nonlinear unit cell FE
   models of these chiral honeycombs have been developed using the
   formulation proposed by Auricchio et al. related to pseudo-elastic and
   superelastic SMA materials. The numerical results are compared with
   experimental ones from tensile tests of chiral honeycomb samples
   subjected to uniaxial tensile loading at full martensite phase, and
   analytical results from the model proposed by Prall and Lakes on
   hexachiral configurations. A working prototype of a deployable antenna
   made out hexachiiral cells with 1-way SMA ribbon is also described.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the method of low-frequency internal friction (1...3 Hz),

   and mathematical simulation of dislocation motion are used to study the
   microplastic strain in naturally aged auxetic beryllium irradiated with
   high-energy (18.eV) electrons. It is discovered that with increase in
   radiation dose, the internal friction and the dislocation velocity
   increase by a factor of 2-3. The stage character of microplastic strain
   of auxetic.. is established. With the aid of mathematical simulation it
   is demonstrated that strain in the irradiated material is due to
   accelerated motion of twinning dislocations at the initial stage which
   is changed to abnormal dynamic deceleration of full dislocations with
   increasing degree of strain at the second stage. It is shown that
   theoretically estimated values are in good agreement with the

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to initiate an investigation based on
   the design of a thin sandwich panel with an auxetic (i.e. exhibiting

   print technology. The sandwich panels were fabricated by attaching the
   3D LayWooden pyramidal truss structures to HDF face sheets with the PVCa
   adhesive. The mechanical strengths and failure mechanisms under bending
   load were estimated experimentally, analytically and numerically. The
   results showed that the mechanical properties of beams increase with an
   increasing inclination angle of struts and/or relative density of the
   core. No signs of damage were observed, such as face sheet crushing (FC)
   or wrinkling (FW), core member crushing (CB, CC) (delamination or
   fracture). Damage to the composites occurred due to shearing in the
   struts of the cells. The greatest rigidity was recorded for beams with a
   D-core. The data could provide insight into the design of optimized or

Abstract = {{Analytical and Molecular Mechanics methods have been used to study the
   structure and deformation mechanisms acting at the molecular level in
   the auxetic polymorph of crystalline silica (alpha-cristobalite). The
   Molecular Mechanics simulations indicate a stress-induced phase
   transition from alpha-cristobalite to `ordered' beta-cristobalite occurs
   for uniaxial loading along the x(2) direction. This is in reasonable
   agreement with the previous prediction from an analytical model assuming
   deformation is by concurrent dilation and cooperative rotation (about
   axes in the x(1)-x(2), plane, passing through the midpoints of opposing
   edges - the alpha-axes) of the SiO4 tetrahedral molecular sub-units,
   previously shown to predict the Poisson's ratio for loading in the),
   direction. The analytical models have been extended to include
   cooperative rotation of each tetrahedron about its axis (the c-axis)
   mostly closely aligned with the principal unit-cell x(3)-axis. The new
   models enable significantly improved prediction of the Poisson's ratios
   of (alpha-cristobalite when loaded in one of the transverse (x(1) or
   x(2)) directions. Parametric fitting of the analytical models indicate
   that the deformation mechanism for transverse uniaxial loading of
   alpha-cristobalite is by concurrent dilation and cooperative rotation
   about the local a and c-axes of the SiO4, tetrahedra. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH

   the mechanical properties of Li-Sn alloys based on density functional
   theory, including elastic constants such as the orientation-averaged
   bulk, shear and Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios, as well as the
   anisotropy and brittleness-ductility. It is shown that bulk, shear and
   Young's moduli of isotropic LixSn alloys decrease almost linearly with
   the increase of Li concentration. Further, based on the analysis of
   shear to bulk modulus and Poisson's ratios, it is inferred that Li-Sn
   alloys are brittle. The poor cycle performance and crushing failure of
   Sn anode materials during charging and discharging are mainly due to a
   transition of electrode material properties from ductile to brittle.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear mechanical responses of tetrachiral honeycombs under large
   deformation are theoretically analyzed by employing elliptic integrals,
   and the results are verified by numerical simulations. The nonlinear
   relationships between normal stress, shear stress, Poisson's ratio and
   the strain are derived for the tetrachiral honeycombs. It is found that
   the Poison's ratio of the tetrachiral honeycombs under large deformation
   is totally different from that under small deformation. The Poisson's
   ratio can achieve to a large magnitude of 0.8 in the former case, while
   remains 0 in the latter case. Moreover, the tetrachiral honeycombs
   exhibit positive Poison's ratio under large tensile-deformation, whilst
   showing negative Poisson's ratio under large compression-deformation.
   The magnitude of Poisson's ratio depends on both the honeycomb's
   deformation and the ligament relative length, while it is insensitive to
   the ligament thickness. Besides, the coupling effect between tensile (or
   compression) and shear is observed for the tetrachiral honeycombs. In
   other words, shear deformation appears within the honeycomb under
   uniaxial loading. The coupling effect depends on both the honeycomb's
   deformation and the geometric parameters of the cell structure. And the
   quantitative relationships among them are derived. This special coupling
   effect of tetrachiral honeycombs provides a new idea for designing more
   metamaterials. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Internal stability of isotropic nonlinear elastic materials under
   homogeneous deformation is studied. Results provide new insight into
   various intrinsic stability measures, first proposed elsewhere, for
   generic nonlinear elastic solids. Three intrinsic stability criteria
   involving three different tangent elastic stiffness matrices are
   considered, corresponding to respective increments in strain measures
   conjugate to thermodynamic tension, first Piola-Kirchhoff stress, and
   Cauchy stress. Primary deformation paths of interest include spherical
   (i.e., isotropic) deformation, uniaxial strain, and simple shear;
   unstable modes are not constrained to remain along primary deformation
   paths. Effects of choices of second- and third-order elastic constants
   on intrinsic stability are systematically studied for physically
   realistic ranges of constants. For most cases investigated here,
   internal stability according to strain increments conjugate to Cauchy
   stress is found to be the most stringent criterion. When third-order
   constants vanish, internal stability under large compression tends to
   decrease as Poisson's ratio increases. When third-order constants are
   nonzero, a negative (positive) pressure derivative of the shear modulus
   often promotes unstable modes in compression (tension). For large shear
   deformation, larger magnitudes of third-order constants tend to result
   in more unstable behavior, regardless of the sign of the pressure
   derivative of the shear modulus. A compressible neo-Hookean model is
   generally much more intrinsically stable than second- and third-order
   elastic models when Poisson's ratio is non-negative. Published by

Title = {{A theoretical model for the estimate of plateau force for the crushing
   process of 3D auxetic anti-tetra chiral structures}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{199}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic, anti-tetra-chiral structures designed as tubes subjected to
   axial quasi-static crushing were investigated in this research.
   Experimental work was carried on samples manufactured by laser cutting
   from a pipe. At the same time, numerical simulations were performed
   using a parametric numerical model of the structure. The experimental
   results analysis revealed that the crushing force presents a plateau
   region that extends up to the densification phase defined by the close
   contact between the ligaments joining the nodes. Subsequently, based on
   the representative unit's deformation characteristics, theoretical
   calculation models were established to estimate the plateau force.
   According to Bernoulli's beam model, the force calculation model was
   developed from the plastic hinge's structural design and theory.
   Sametime, the length or crushing distance with a constant force
   (plateau), can be estimated to provide the complete set of parameters
   for design activities. The analytical solution was validated against
   results obtained numerical simulation for various configurations. There
   is a good agreement between experimental, numerical, and theoretical
   results that proves the proposed model's reliability to estimate plateau
   force. Furthermore, individual parts were stacked to define graded
   structures. It was found that the crushing force displays successive
   stages according to each individual part. There is a possibility to
   reconstruct the response for stacked structure from the individual
   response using the analytical solution's results for force and length of
   individual plateau stages.
   The set of equations can design this structure when the capable load is
   one of the input parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Origami, as it moves from an art to a scientifically useful technology,
   enables a rich design space given the numerous bifurcations that exist
   off the flat state. In this work, we utilize origami as a platform for
   design of auxetic metamaterials and employ topology optimization for the
   automated robust discovery of these structures. In particular, the
   mechanical analysis is performed with an efficient and accurate
   nonlinear truss element model that captures the geometric nonlinearities
   associated with origami folding, and modal analysis off the flat state
   enables access to the many bifurcating branches of folding. Here,
   objective functions are explored that target a desired in plane
   Poisson's ratio. The Miura-ori fold pattern, a commonly studied
   flat-foldable pattern, is considered as a verification study for the
   framework presented.}},

Abstract = {{Some problems of elasticity theory related to highly compressible
   two-dimensional elastic bodies are considered. Such problems arise in
   real elasticity and pertain to some materials having negative Poisson
   ratio. The common feature of such problems is the presence of a small
   parameter epsilon. If epsilon > 0, the corresponding equations are
   elliptic and the boundary data obey the Shapiro-Lopatinsky condition. If
   epsilon = 0, this condition is violated and the problem may fail to be
   solvable in distribution spaces. The rather difficult passing to the
   limit is studied.}},

Abstract = {{There is much recent interest in finding rare genetic variants
   associated with various diseases. Owing to the scarcity of rare
   mutations, single-variant analyses often lack power. To enable pooling
   of information across variants, we use a random effect formulation
   within a retrospective modeling framework that respects the
   retrospective data collecting mechanism of casecontrol studies. More
   concretely, we model the control allele frequencies of the variants as
   random effects, and the systematic differences between the case and
   control frequencies as fixed effects, resulting in a mixed model. The
   use of Poisson approximation and gamma-distributed random effects
   results in a generalized negative binomial distribution for the joint
   distribution of the control and case frequencies. Variants are selected
   by conducting stepwise likelihood ratio tests. The superiority of the
   proposed method over two existing variant selection methods is
   demonstrated in a simulation study. The effects of non-gamma random
   effects and correlated variants are also found to be not too detrimental
   in the simulation study. When the proposed procedure is applied to
   identify rare variants associated with obesity, it identifies one
   additional variant not picked up by existing methods.}},

Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Very recently, two-dimensional (2D) boron sheets (borophene) with
   rectangular structures were grown successfully on single crystal Ag(111)
   substrates (Mannix et al 2015 Science 350 1513). The fabricated
   boroprene is predicted to have unusual mechanical properties. We
   performed first-principle calculations to investigate the mechanical
   properties of the monolayer borophene, including ideal tensile strength
   and critical strain. It was found that monolayer borophene can withstand
   stress up to 20.26 N m(-1) and 12.98 N m(-1) in a and b directions,
   respectively. However, its critical strain was found to be small. In the
   a direction, the critical value is only 8\%, which, to the best of our
   knowledge, is the lowest among all studied 2D materials. Our numerical
   results show that the tensile strain applied in the b direction enhances
   the bucking height of borophene resulting in an out-of-plane negative
   Poisson's ratio, which makes the boron sheet show superior mechanical
   flexibility along the b direction. The failure mechanism and phonon
   instability of monolayer borophene were also explored.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a sparse image reconstruction method for Poisson-distributed
   polychromatic X-ray computed tomography (CT) measurements under the
   blind scenario where the material of the inspected object and the
   incident energy spectrum are unknown. We employ our mass-attenuation
   spectrum parameterization of the noiseless measurements and express the
   mass attenuation spectrum as a linear combination of B-spline basis
   functions of order one. A block coordinate-descent algorithm is
   developed for constrained minimization of a penalized Poisson negative
   log-likelihood (NLL) cost function, where constraints and penalty terms
   ensure nonnegativity of the spline coefficients and nonnegativity and
   sparsity of the density map image; the image sparsity is imposed using a
   convex total-variation (TV) norm penalty term. This algorithm alternates
   between a Nesterov's proximal-gradient (NPG) step for estimating the
   density map image and a limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
   with box constraints (L-BFGS-B) step for estimating the
   incident-spectrum parameters. To accelerate convergence of the density
   map NPG steps, we apply function restart and a step-size selection
   scheme that accounts for varying local Lipschitz constants of the
   Poisson NLL. Real X-ray CT reconstruction examples demonstrate the
   performance of the proposed scheme.}},

   counts model incorporating several binary predictors for the difficulty

   predictors, locally D-optimal designs are developed. After an
   introduction to the Rasch Poisson counts model and its extension, we
   will specify these models as particular generalized linear models. Based
   on this embedding, optimal designs for both models including several
   binary explanatory variables will be presented. Therefore, we will
   derive conditions on the effect sizes for certain designs to be locally
   D-optimal. Finally, it is pointed out that the results derived for the
   Rasch Poisson models can be applied for more general Poisson regression
   models which should receive more attention in future psychological

Abstract = {{The need for control of the elastic properties of architected materials
   has been accentuated due to the advances in modelling and
   characterization. Among the plethora of unconventional mechanical
   responses, controlled anisotropy and auxeticity have been promulgated as
   a new avenue in bioengineering applications. This paper aims to
   delineate the mechanical performance of characteristic auxetic and
   anisotropic designs fabricated by multiphoton lithography. Through
   finite element analysis the distinct responses of representative
   topologies are conveyed. In addition, nanoindentation experiments
   observed in-situ through scanning electron microscopy enable the
   validation of the modeling and the observation of the anisotropic or
   auxetic phenomena. Our results herald how these categories of
   architected materials can be investigated at the microscale.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the normal impact of a rigid sphere on a half-space of
   elasto-plastic auxetic/metal foam using the finite element method. The
   dependence of the coefficient of restitution, peak force, maximum
   displacement, and contact duration on the yield strain, impact velocity,
   and elastic and plastic Poisson's ratio is analyzed. For a given elastic
   Poisson's ratio, the coefficient of restitution generally decreases with
   an increase in the plastic Poisson's ratio and impact velocity. When the
   plastic Poisson's is maintained constant, the coefficient of restitution
   increases with an increase of the elastic Poisson's ratio. These trends
   are explained using plastic energy dissipation. The energy dissipation
   trends are further investigated by decomposing it into deviatoric and
   hydrostatic parts. For a given impact velocity, the peak force is
   relatively insensitive to most of the elastic and plastic Poisson's
   ratio combinations. We also show that for the cases where the elastic
   and plastic Poisson's ratios are equal, the coefficient of restitution
   is relatively insensitive to their actual values. These findings can
   guide researchers to identify the right elastic and plastic Poisson's
   ratio combinations so that lattice materials with exceptional energy
   absorbing capacity can be designed using topology optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral hyper-structure is a family of lightweight structure with
   negative Poisson's ratio, which leads benefit in mechanical properties
   and designability. In order to further improve some mechanical
   properties of chiral hyper-structures, the concept of gradient is
   introduced into the structure. Five groups of gradient tetra-chiral
   hyper-structure with different gradient factors are fabricated based on
   waterjet cutting technology, and the in-plane quasi-static lateral
   compression tests are carried out. Finite element models are developed
   for the in-plane linear elastic mechanical properties and plastic
   deformation modes under lateral compression condition. Theoretical
   prediction models of elastic modulus in gradient direction and Poisson's
   ratio of the gradient tetra-chiral hyper-structure is derived based on
   geometric assumptions and inhomogeneous deformation mode which are
   verified by experiments and finite element analysis. Simultaneously, the
   effects of gradient factors on the deformation characteristics and
   mechanical behaviors of the tetra-chiral hyper-structure are discussed
   and analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical inference based on correlated count measurements are
   frequently performed in biomedical studies. Most of existing sample size
   calculation methods for count outcomes are developed under the Poisson
   model. Deviation from the Poisson assumption (equality of mean and
   variance) has been widely documented in practice, which indicates urgent
   needs of sample size methods with more realistic assumptions to ensure
   valid experimental design. In this study, we investigate sample size
   calculation for clinical trials with correlated count measurements based
   on the negative binomial distribution. This approach is flexible to
   accommodate overdispersion and unequal measurement intervals, as well as
   arbitrary randomization ratios, missing data patterns, and correlation
   structures. Importantly, the derived sample size formulas have closed
   forms both for the comparison of slopes and for the comparison of
   time-averaged responses, which greatly reduces the burden of
   implementation in practice. We conducted extensive simulation to
   demonstrate that the proposed method maintains the nominal levels of
   power and type I error over a wide range of design configurations. We
   illustrate the application of this approach using a real epileptic
   trial.}},

   properties}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{50}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{The family of two-dimensional (2D) crystals was recently joined by
   silica, one of the most abundant resources on earth. So far two
   different polymorphs of this material, namely a tetrahedra-shaped
   monolayer and a fully saturated bilayer structure, have been synthesized
   on various metal substrates and their fascinating properties enable 2D
   silica to hold promise in nanoelectronic device applications. In this
   paper a new ground state of bilayer-AAr-stacking ha-silica-has been
   discovered by first principles calculations. The new structure is
   featured with a formation of Si-Si bonds between all sp(3) hybridized
   SiO3 triangular pyramids, lying respectively in different silica layers,
   with an intrinsic rotational angle of about 12.5 degrees along the
   out-of-plane Si-Si bond. Due to the doubled number of Si-Si bonds in the
   new structure, the system energy is lowered by nearly three times more
   than that reported recently in literature (0.8 eV) (Ozcelik et al 2014
   Phys. Rev. Lett. 112 246803), when compared with the single layer
   ha-silica. A mechanical property investigation shows that the
   AAr-stacking bilayer ha-silica possesses high in-plane stiffness and a
   negative Poisson's ratio, which stems from the intrinsic rotational
   angle of the SiO3 triangular pyramids. Strikingly, the negative
   Poisson's ratio evolves into positive at a critical tensile strain
   epsilon approximate to 1.2\%. Such negative-to-positive evolvement is
   associated with the adaptation of the rotational angle to the applied
   strain and the structure transition into the nearby valley of the energy
   landscape. The detailed transition process has been thoroughly analyzed.
   The electronic properties of the new ground state are also calculated,
   along with their response to the external strain. Our new ground state
   structure introduces a new member to the family of 2D bilayer silica
   materials and is expected to facilitate experimental studies identifying
   the related structures and exploring further physical and chemical
   properties of nanoscale systems.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanical properties of metal-organic frameworks
   (MOFs) is crucial not only to yield robust practical applications, but
   also to advance fundamental research underpinning the flexibility of a
   myriad of open-framework chemical compounds. Herein we present one of
   the most comprehensive structural analyses yet on MOF-mechanics:
   elucidating the complex elastic response of an isoreticular series of
   topical Zr-based MOFs, explaining all the important mechanical
   properties, and identifying major trends arising from systematic organic
   linker exchange. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) was employed
   to establish the single-crystal elastic constants of the nanoporous
   MIL-140(A-D) structures, generating a complete 3-D representation of the
   principal mechanical properties, encompassing the Young's modulus, shear
   modulus, linear compressibility and Poisson's ratio. Of particular
   interest, we discovered significantly high values of both positive and
   negative linear compressibility and Poisson's ratio, whose framework
   molecular mechanisms responsible for such elastic anomalies have been
   fully revealed. In addition to pinpointing large elastic anisotropy and
   unusual physical properties, we analyzed the bulk modulus of
   isoreticular Zr-MOF compounds to understand the framework structural
   resistance against the hydrostatic pressure, and determined the averaged
   mechanical behaviour of bulk (polycrystalline) MOF materials important
   for the design of emergent applications.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral honeycombs of different types have been found to display auxetic
   behavior (a negative Poisson's ratio). This paper investigates the
   constitutive relations and the auxetic properties of tetrachiral
   honeycombs. It is found that coupling between shearing and stretching
   exists in tetrachiral honeycombs and this causes some ambiguity when

   proposed, as opposed to the traditional definition of Poisson's ratio.
   This proposed parameter correctly describes the auxeticity of
   tetrachiral and other honeycombs. An analytical expression for this

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of the stent are of key importance to the
   mechanical integrity and performance reliability of stent-plaque-artery
   system, and an ideal stent should have good bending compliance, axial
   deformation stability, hoop strength and stiffness, larger radial
   expandable ability, etc. In this paper, innovative chiral stent designs
   with auxetic properties are proposed, and amplified stent sample is
   fabricated with SLS additive manufacturing technique. Firstly, through
   combining micro-CT tomography and image-based finite element analysis,
   the mechanical properties of as fabricated SLS stent are explored;
   Secondly, two series of stent samples are fabricated with SLS additive
   manufacturing techniques, and in-situ compression experiments are
   performed for studying the deformation mechanisms and auxetic mechanical
   behaviors of stents. Finally, effects of geometrical parameters on the
   tensile mechanical performance of these stents are studied with finite
   element analysis. The proposed chiral stent exhibits auxetic behaviors,
   and can be tailored through adjusting the unit cell design parameters,
   such as: struct numbers along circumferential directions, ligament
   lengths, and node radius.}},

Title = {{Achieving adjustable elasticity with non-affine to affine transition}},
Journal = {{NATURE MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{For various engineering and industrial applications it is desirable to
   realize mechanical systems with broadly adjustable elasticity to respond
   flexibly to the external environment. Here we discover a
   topology-correlated transition between affine and non-affine regimes in
   elasticity in both two- and three-dimensional packing-derived networks.
   Based on this transition, we numerically design and experimentally
   realize multifunctional systems with adjustable elasticity. Within one
   system, we achieve solid-like affine response, liquid-like non-affine
   response and a continuous tunability in between. Moreover, the system
   also exhibits a broadly tunable Poisson's ratio from positive to
   negative values, which is of practical interest for energy absorption
   and for fracture-resistant materials. Our study reveals a fundamental
   connection between elasticity and network topology, and demonstrates its
   practical potential for designing mechanical systems and metamaterials.
   A non-affine to affine transition in elasticity occurs with the change
   of system topology in a packing-derived network, which enables the
   tuning of elastic moduli and Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale carbon nanotube (CNT) films fabricated by floating catalyst
   chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) are promising reinforcement materials
   for high performance composites. However, little research has been
   reported on the four independent in-plane engineering constants of FCCVD
   CNT films, which are essential for understanding and prediction of
   mechanical behavior of FCCVD CNT film-based structures. The tensile
   strength in CNT-oriented direction is 127 MPa and the tensile modulus in
   oriented and transverse directions are 3.0 and 0.3 GPa, respectively.
   These mechanical properties are mainly attributed to the as-grown
   CNT-to-CNT contacts in the films. The Poisson's ratio in the oriented
   direction at 5 \% strain is 0.75. A negative Poisson's ratio of -0.99 is
   observed at 0.1 \% strain in CNT-oriented direction. The in-plane shear
   modulus is 0.57 GPa, which is derived from the coordinate transformation
   between the on-axis and 45A degrees off-axis compliance matrices. The
   in-situ scanning electron microscopy is adopted to observe the
   microstructure at different tensile strains. During the tensile testing,
   the reorientation of CNT bundles in CNT film is evaluated by numerical
   image processing and Raman spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{In statistics, stochastic orders formalize such a concept that one
   random variable is bigger than another. In this paper, we develop a new
   class of discrete bivariate distributions based on a stochastic order
   defined by the likelihood ratio. We derive general formula for the joint
   distributions belonging to the class. It will be seen that, from the
   proposed class, specific families of distributions can be efficiently
   generated just by specifying the `baseline seed distributions'. An
   important feature of the proposed discrete bivariate model is that,
   unlike other discrete bivariate models already proposed in the
   literature such as the well-known and most popular bivariate Poisson
   distribution by Holgate, it can model both positive and negative
   dependence. A number of new families of discrete bivariate distributions
   are generated from the proposed class. Furthermore, the generated
   bivariate distributions are applied to analyze real data sets and the
   results are compared with those obtained from some conventional models.}},

Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1330-1339}},

Abstract = {{Introducing hierarchy into structures has been credited with improving
   elastic properties and damage tolerance. Specifically, adding
   hierarchical sub-structures to honeycombs, which themselves have
   good-density specific elastic and energy-absorbing properties, has been
   proposed in the literature. An investigation of the elastic properties
   and structural hierarchy in honeycombs was undertaken, exploring the
   effects of adding hierarchy into a range of honeycombs, with hexagonal,
   triangular or square geometry super and sub-structure cells, via
   simulation using finite elements. Key parameters describing these
   geometries included the relative lengths of the sub- and
   super-structures, the fraction of mass shared between the sub- and
   super-structures, the co-ordination number of the honeycomb cells, the
   form and extent of functional grading, and the Poisson's ratio of the
   sub-structure. The introduction of a hierarchical sub-structure into a
   honeycomb, in most cases, has a deleterious effect upon the in-plane
   density specific elastic modulus, typically a reduction of 40 to 50\% vs
   a conventional non-hierarchical version. More complex sub-structures,
   e.g. graded density, can recover values of density specific elastic
   modulus. With careful design of functionally graded unit cells it is
   possible to exceed, by up to 75\%, the density specific modulus of
   conventional versions. A negative Poisson's ratio sub-structure also
   engenders substantial increases to the density modulus versus
   conventional honeycombs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents the results of a numerical simulation of the effects
   of N-2 on the characteristics of Trichel pulses in SF6 at 0.4MPa. The
   simulation was performed in a 2D axisymmetric geometry assuming a three
   species discharge model for the applied voltage on the discharge
   electrode to be -25 kV. Three drift-diffusion equations coupled with
   Poisson's equation are considered to determine the dynamic behavior of
   Trichel pulses and the temporal and spatial distributions of charged
   species. The reduced ionization coefficient, the reduced attachment
   coefficient, the electron mobility, and the electron diffusion
   coefficient of SF6/N-2 mixtures are obtained by solving the two-term
   Boltzmann equations. The content of N-2 varies from 20\% to 80\%. The
   distribution of three charged species and the reduced electric field at
   the discharge tip are presented at different instants of time to explain
   the formation mechanism of the Trichel pulses in SF6/N-2 mixtures. The
   time-dependent current, the total number of electrons, the positive
   ions, and the negative ions as well as the reduced electric field at the
   discharge tip under different SF6/N-2 mixtures are analyzed to
   investigate the sensitivities of these properties to the N-2 content.}},

Title = {{Tribological behavior of polytetrafluoroethylene coating reinforced with

Abstract = {{This study compares the tribological performance of
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) thin film coating reinforced with black
   phosphorus (BP) or ball-milled graphite (BMG) nanoparticles, so as to
   elucidate their mechanism of action under reciprocating sliding test
   conditions. PTFE coatings with 0.5 wt.\% BMG (BMG/PTFE) and 0.5 wt.\% BP
   (BP/PTFE) were prepared on GCr15 bearing steel disk by using a spin
   coater. The friction and wear tests were carried out by using the
   ball-on-disk tribometer under a normal load of 1 N (contact pressure:
   780 MPa), a frequency of 2 Hz, and 4.2 mm sliding displacement
   amplitude. The surface roughness, wear volume and surface morphology of
   the coatings were characterized by the three-dimensional white light,
   and Energy Dispersive X-ray Detector (EDX) analysis coupled with
   environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). It is found that
   BP/PTFE coating has better anti-wear and anti-friction performances than
   those of pure PTFE or BMG/PTFE coating. The coating with BP
   nanoparticles shows excellent tribological properties with the wear
   volume decreased from 3.52 x 10(6) mu m(3) to 1.64 x 10(6) mu m(3) and
   the coefficient of friction (COF) decreased from 0.117 to 0.046. More
   importantly, the BP layer probably expands and absorbs much energy due
   to its negative Poisson's ratio phenomenon under reciprocating sliding,
   and effectively reducing furrow and adhesive wear. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{While collagen is recognized as the predominant mechanical component of
   soft connective tissues, the role of the non-fibrillar matrix (NFM) is
   less well understood. Even model systems, such as the collagen-agarose
   co-gel, can exhibit complex behavior, making it difficult to identify
   relative contributions of specific tissue constituents. In the present
   study, we developed a two-component microscale model of collagen-agarose
   tissue analogs and used it to elucidate the interaction between collagen
   and NFM in uniaxial tension. Collagen fibers were represented with
   Voronoi networks, and the NFM was modeled as a neo-Hookean solid. Model
   predictions of total normal stress and Poisson's ratio matched
   experimental observations well (including high Poisson's values of
   similar to 3), and the addition of NFM led to composition-dependent
   decreases in volume change and increases in fiber stretch. Because the
   NFM was more resistant to volume change than the fiber network,
   extension of the composite led to pressurization of the NFM. Within a
   specific range of parameter values (low shear modulus and moderate
   Poisson's ratio), the magnitude of the reaction force decreased relative
   to this pressurization component resulting in a negative (compressive)
   NFM stress in the loading direction, even though the composite tissue
   was in tension.}},

Abstract = {{The crystal structure, phase transformation, and elastic properties of

   The calculated results first predict the phase transformation from

   pressure, the variations of the elastic constant C-ij, bulk modulus B,

   of the bulk to shear modulus B/G, and normalized primitive cell volume

   positive effect firstly and then negative effect on the ductility of
   monoclinic CuO, but results in the opposite of hardness. Moreover, we

Abstract = {{The structural, elastic, electronic properties and Debye temperature of

   formation enthalpies and elastic constants both indicate that Ni3Ta is
   stable under different pressures. The bulk modulus B, shear modulus G,
   Young's modulus E and Poisson's ratio are calculated by the
   Voigt-Reuss-Hill method. The bigger ratio of B/G indicates Ni3Ta is
   ductile and the pressure can improve the ductility of Ni3Ta. In
   addition, the results of density of states and the charge density
   difference show that the stability of Ni3Ta is improved by the
   increasing pressure. The Debye temperature Theta(D) calculated from

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal
   dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are of vital importance in any practical
   applications to flexible devices and nano-electromechanical systems.
   Thus, the mechanical properties of monolayer TMDCs, a stoichiometric
   formula MX2 in which M = Mo, W and X = S, Se, Te, are investigated by
   using density functional theory. More importantly, based on the
   different atomic arrangement, all three chemical isomers, such as 1T, 1T
   `, and 1H phases, are compared in detail. We found that their 2D Young's
   moduli and Poisson's ratios display a strong dependence not only on the
   atomic species but also on the atomic arrangements. For the same
   structural phase, monolayer TMDCs with the W (S) atom are found to be
   much stiffer in each chalcogenide (metal) group. Due to the threefold
   rotation symmetry of the hexagonal lattice, 1T- and 1H-TMDC monolayers
   belong to the isotropic structures, while the strong anisotropic Young's
   moduli and Poisson's ratios are observed in the 1T ` phase, i.e., 2D
   Young's moduli along the armchair direction are nearly 50\% larger than
   those along the zigzag direction for tellurides. Interestingly, 1T-TMDC
   monolayers show negative Poisson's ratios. Furthermore, their in-plane
   1H/1T ` heterostructures could be constructed, and the corresponding
   mechanical properties are explored. We found that the influence of the
   1H/1T ` interface on the mechanical behavior is detrimental, which
   reduces the in-plane stiffness normal to the 1H/1T ` interface as
   compared with 1H and 1T ` structures. However, in comparison with the 1T
   ` phase, a remarkable strength of these novel heterostructures is along
   the 1H/1T ` interface direction. In brief, the present first-principles
   results constitute a useful picture for the mechanical properties of 2D
   TMDCs and their in-plane heterostructures.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an origami-based auxetic tunable Helmholtz
   resonator by controlling the volume of the cavity to allow a real-time
   tunability of the resonance frequency. The design is inspired by the
   waterbomb origami base, which expands when stretched and contracts when
   compressed. Such a foldable structure offers a wide range of volume
   variation, which corresponds to a larger frequency shift in the
   bandwidth of interest. Based on the design of the origami resonator,
   multi-physical models are established to understand and predict the
   parameters' effect on the device's behavior. After fabrication,
   experimental tests are conducted on physical prototypes to validate the
   models and illustrate the effectiveness of the concept.}},

Abstract = {{Contact surface unevenness of the dry-stackable, interlocking blocks
   adversely affects the constructability of the drystack system. This
   paper presents the contact surface characteristics of these blocks and
   strategies for mitigating the unevenness through systematic experimental
   and numerical studies. First, the contact surface characteristics of the
   dry-stackable blocks have been examined experimentally using matrix
   based tactile surface sensors (MBTSS). High peak pressure locations on
   the contacting interfaces have been identified; these locations have
   remained unaffected by the level of the applied load in the experiment.
   A micro finite element modelling method incorporating the uneven contact
   surface has been formulated and the parameters calibrated using the
   experimental data. Two strategies for minimising the contact surface
   unevenness are then proposed (1) grinding of the surfaces of the blocks
   and (2) embedding a packing material between the surfaces. Both
   strategies have been analysed through the finite element model. The peak
   contact pressure is shown to have reduced considerably for the grinding
   strategy and when an auxetic fabric is used as an insert between the
   contacting surfaces of the blocks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper we discuss Bayesian nonconvex penalization for sparse

   We exemplify four specific subordinators: Gamma, Poisson, negative
   binomial and squared Bessel subordinators. The Laplace exponents of the
   subordinators are Bernstein functions, so they can be used as
   sparsity-inducing nonconvex penalty functions. We exploit these
   subordinators in regression problems, yielding a hierarchical model with
   multiple regularization parameters. We devise ECME
   (Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either) algorithms to
   simultaneously estimate regression coefficients and regularization
   parameters. The empirical evaluation of simulated data shows that our
   approach is feasible and effective in high-dimensional data analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of dynamic compressive stimulation on MG-63 cell
   proliferation on an auxetic PLGA scaffold was investigated. The
   estimated Poisson ratio of the prepared auxetic scaffold specimens was
   approximately (-)0.07, while the Poisson ratio estimated for
   conventional scaffold specimens was (+)0.12 under 10\% strain
   compression on average. Three stimulus groups were examined: control (no
   stimulation), static compression, and dynamic compression. In
   preparation for proliferation testing, cells were seeded at 2.2 x 10(5)
   cells/80 mu L on each scaffold specimen. The average proliferation rates
   of the static and dynamic groups were higher than those of the control
   group: 13.4\% and 25.5\% higher at culture day 1, 34.7\% and 56.2\% at
   culture day 3, and 17.5\% and 43.0\% at culture day 5, respectively. The
   static and dynamic group results at culture day 5 were significantly
   different (p < 0.01). Moreover, proliferation rate of the dynamic
   stimulation group was 1.22 times higher than that of the static group (p
   < 0.01). Conclusively, proliferation of osteoblast-like cells was
   enhanced through compressive stimulation, but the enhancement was
   maximal with dynamic compressive stimulation of auxetic scaffolds.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to compare count regression models to identify
   the best model and evaluate the effect of year, season, parity and
   litter size of sows at farrowing on the number of mummified fetuses per
   litter. Data from a commercial production unit in Yucatan, Mexico were
   used. Management and feeding of the animals were typical of the region.
   Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), zero-inflated
   negative binomial (MB) and normal distribution regression models were
   evaluated and their goodness-of-fit was compared. Among the 1689 litters
   60.27\% had zero mummies. The mean number of mummies was 0.649 +/- 1.028
   for litter for data including zeros and 1.634 +/- 1.025 for data with at
   least one mummified fetus. The ratio of the Pearson Chi-square
   value/degrees of freedom was significantly different front 1 for
   Poisson, negative binomial and ZIP models, indicating overdispersion
   (variance> mean) of the trait studied. However, the ZINB model indicated
   no overdispersion (P=0.0684). The ZINB model was considered the best
   model based on log likelihood, AIC and BIC. The significance of factors
   varied according to the model used. Furthermore, Poisson models had
   minor standard errors and in consequence tended to reject the null
   hypothesis more easily than negative binomial models. Under the ZAN B
   model, year and parity number had significant effects on the number of
   mummified fetuses per litter (P<0.05). In conclusion, parity number was
   an important risk factor associated to the number of mummified piglets.
   The best model that describes the number of mummified piglets was the
   zero inflated negative binomial regression procedure.}},

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{368-381}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{We report a series of novel two-dimensional (2D) group-IV carbides with
   perfectly ordered arrangement of tetragons and hexagons. The 2D tetrahex
   carbides possess robust energetic, dynamical, thermal, and mechanical
   stabilities. They have strong anisotropic mechanical, electronic, and
   optical properties. The negative Poisson's ratio (PR) in the 2D tetrahex
   carbides emerges by small tensile strain (2-5\%). The feature of
   sign-tunable PR enables them to be non-auxetic, auxetic, and
   partially-auxetic nanomaterials. They exhibit ultrahigh ideal strength
   that can even outperform graphene. They are natural semiconductors with
   direct and indirect band gaps which can be tuned by strain engineering.
   Beyond the binary carbides, the ternary alloying of group-IV elements
   further provides the ability to engineer their structural, mechanical,
   optical, and electronic properties. Excitingly, the alloying offers a
   continuous band gap energy, band edge modulation, and indirect-to-direct
   band gap transition. The 2D tetrahex-carbides exhibit high and
   directionally anisotropic carrier mobility, favorable for the separation
   of photogenerated carriers, and has very good optical absorption
   performance in the visible-light region. The position of band edges in
   the 2D tetrahex carbides fits perfectly the water oxidation and
   reduction potentials. Therefore, the 2D tetrahex carbides have potential
   applications not only in photocatalytic watersplitting but also in
   designing 2D opto-electro-mechanical devices. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Unprecedented mechanical response of the lattice thermal conductivity of
   auxetic carbon crystals}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{374-380}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Lattice thermal conductivity (kappa) of bulk materials usually increases
   under compression and decreases under tension, while there are still
   some unusual systems, exhibiting reduced kappa when compressed. However,
   to date it has never been reported for a bulk material, whose kappa is
   substantially enhanced under tensile strain. In this paper, we have
   studied thermal transport of three auxetic carbon crystals: cis-C,
   trans-C and hin-C for short, and their strain responses by performing
   first-principles calculations. It is intriguing to find that their kappa
   are much lower than those of their allotropes, and further decrease
   abnormally under compression. More strikingly, kappa of trans-C (cis-C)
   anomalously increases with tensile strain up to 7\% (6\%) with maximum
   kappa of almost 7 (5) times larger than the unstrained value. The
   abnormal strain dependent kappa are attributed to the dominant role of
   the enhancement of phonon lifetime under stretching, which can be
   further explained from the unique atomic structure of the main chain of
   polydiacetylene in trans-C and cis-C. The weakening of phonon
   anharmonicity is reflected by the enhancement of root mean-square
   displacement values. The reported giant augmentation of kappa may
   inspire intensive research on auxetic carbon crystals as potential
   materials for emerging nanoelectronic devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN 19}},
Abstract = {{Brillouin light scattering and impulsive stimulated light scattering
   have been used to determine the full elastic constants
   ofmagnesiosiderite {[}(Mg-0.35 Fe-0.65)CO3] up to 70 GPa at room
   temperature in a diamond-anvil cell. Drastic softening in C-11, C-33,
   C-12, and C-13 elasticmoduli associatedwith the compressive stress
   component and stiffening in C-44 and C-14 moduli associated with the
   shear stress component are observed to occur within the spin transition
   between similar to 42.4 and 46.5 GPa. Negative values of C-12 and C-13
   are also observed within the spin transition region. The Born criteria
   constants for the crystal remain positive within the spin transition,
   indicating that themixed-spin state remains mechanically stable.
   Significant auxeticity can be related to the electronic spin
   transition-induced elastic anomalies based on the analysis of Poisson's
   ratio. These elastic anomalies are explained using a thermo elastic
   model for the rhombohedral system. Finally, we conclude that mixed-spin
   state ferromagnesite, which is potentially a major deep-carbon carrier,
   is expected to exhibit abnormal elasticity, including a negative
   Poisson's ratio of -0.6 and drastically reduced V-P by 10\%, in Earth's
   midlower mantle.}},

   interpreted as a DIS or semielasticity in the same manner as continuous
   coefficients, which has been overlooked by some empirical researchers.
   Then we show how interaction terms can be easily transformed into a DIS
   and derive the asymptotic distribution of this estimator. We illustrate
   the discrepancy between the interaction term coefficient and the DIS
   using an empirical example evaluating the relationship between
   employment, private health insurance and physician office visits. Our
   results can be applied in treatment effect models when the outcome

Abstract = {{Aims To determine the most appropriate regression models to use when
   assessing risk factors for severe hypoglycaemia and to investigate the
   impact of model misspecification and its clinical implications.
   Methods A total of 1229 children with Type 1 diabetes (mean age 11.7
   years sd 4.1), of which 605 (49.2\%) were males, were studied.
   Prospective assessment of severe hypoglycaemia (an event leading to loss
   of consciousness or seizure) was made over the 9-year period, 1992-2001.
   Patients were seen every 3 months and episodes of hypoglycaemia along
   with clinical data were recorded. Over 70\% of children never
   experienced a severe hypoglycaemic event. Data were analysed using the
   Poisson regression, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and
   zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models. The over-dispersion and
   likelihood ratio statistics were calculated and the analytical methods
   compared.
   Results The Poisson regression model did not fit the data well. The
   negative binomial and the zero inflated Poisson and negative binomial
   models fitted the data better than Poisson.
   Conclusions The commonly used Poisson regression models to analyse
   hypoglycaemia epidemiology may lead to biased parameter estimates and
   incorrect determination of risk factors for hypoglycaemia. We recommend
   the use of the negative binomial or zero inflated models to examine any
   risk factors associated with severe hypoglycaemia. Careful consideration
   must be given to the interpretation of hypoglycaemia surveys and their
   analysis.}},

   Cellular Core}},
Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The work concerns a three-point bending test of beams made of plywood,
   high density fibre boards, cardboard, and wood-epoxy mass. The goal of
   the investigation was to determine the effect of thickness and type of
   wood-based facings on stiffness, strength, ability to absorb, and
   dissipate the energy of sandwich beams with an auxetic core. The
   cognitive goal of the work was to demonstrate the possibility of using
   recycled materials for facings and cores instead of popular wood
   composites. Experimental studies and numerical calculations were
   performed on correctly calibrated models. Experimental studies have
   shown that the beams with HDF facings (E = 1528 MPa, MOR = 12.61 MPa)
   and plywood facings (E = 1248-1395 MPa, MOR = 8.34-10.40 MPa) have the
   most favourable mechanical properties. Beams with plywood facings also
   have a good ability to absorb energy (1.380-1.746 J), but, in this
   respect, the beams manufactured of HDF (2.223 J) exhibited better
   capacity. The use of an auxetic core and facings of plywood and
   cardboard significantly reduces the amount of dissipated energy (0.0093
   J, 0.0067 J). Therefore, this type of structures can be used for
   modeling beams carrying high deflections.}},

Abstract = {{Some problems of mechanics of disordered (amorphous) solids: the glass -
   liquid transition, plastic deformation in the solid state, the negative
   Poisson coefficient, features of random densest packing of particles of
   various shape - are discussed basing on results of computer simulation
   of stochastic mechanical behavior of a solid consisting of 1000 elastic
   rigid particles. The number of direct physical contacts between
   particles, their distribution in space and decay in the, course of shear
   strain are shown to result in existence of two states - solid glassy and
   liquid ones, the condition of the transition between them and the main
   mechanical properties of a solid: plasticity, strain softening,
   localization of the strain as shear bands. The criterion of the glass -
   liquid transition is proposed and based, and the dependence of the
   critical number of contacts and of the packing density in the transition
   point on the symmetry of particles and the type of contact forces is
   shown. The possibility to apply the geometrical conceptions to the
   theory of the condensated state is discussed with the assumption, that
   any potential of interaction between particles can be separated into two
   components - rigid repulsion and soft attraction being responsible for
   various physical properties: gas - liquid and liquid - glass
   tranzitions, presence of critical points, mechanical behavior of glasses
   and crystals. Features of the structure of isotropic solids
   characterized by the negative Poisson coefficient are discussed. Such
   solids are shown to be a system of lattice sites (or particles) related
   with the potential or construction having the high shear and flexural
   rigidity comparing with normal one. The structure of rigid polymer and
   metallic foams having the negative Poisson coefficient is explained
   basing on the analysis of elastic behavior of thin layers of the foam
   material after the loss of stability. The densest random packing of
   particles depends both no geometrical and mechanical properties and
   corresponds to the point of the transition of the system into the solid
   state.}},

   decrease in Delta V/V during creep. Immediately after the removal of the
   load, Delta V/V decreased to a negative value; thereafter, it decreased
   slowly and finally reached a certain value. The value of Delta V/V

Abstract = {{Rotating unit systems constitute one of the main classes of auxetic
   metamaterials. In this work, a new design procedure for lightweight
   auxetic systems based on this deformation mechanism is proposed through
   the implementation of a hierarchical triangular truss network in place
   of a full block of material for the rotating component of the system.
   Using numerical simulations in conjunction with experimental tests on 3D
   printed prototypes, the mechanical properties of six types of auxetic
   structures, which include a range of rotating polygons and chiral
   honeycombs, were analysed under the application of small tensile loads.
   The results obtained show that there is almost no difference in the
   Poisson's ratios obtained from the regular, full structures and the ones
   made from triangular truss systems despite the latter, in some cases,
   being 80\% lighter than the former. This indicates that these systems
   could be ideal candidates for implementation in applications requiring
   lightweight auxetic metamaterial systems such as in the aerospace
   industry.}},

Abstract = {{A first step when fitting multilevel models to continuous responses is
   to explore the degree of clustering in the data. Researchers fit
   variance-component models and then report the proportion of variation in
   the response that is due to systematic differences between clusters.
   Equally they report the response correlation between units within a
   cluster. These statistics are popularly referred to as variance
   partition coefficients (VPCs) and intraclass correlation coefficients
   (ICCs). When fitting multilevel models to categorical (binary, ordinal,
   or nominal) and count responses, these statistics prove more challenging
   to calculate. For categorical response models, researchers appeal to
   their latent response formulations and report VPCs/ICCs in terms of
   latent continuous responses envisaged to underly the observed
   categorical responses. For standard count response models, however,
   there are no corresponding latent response formulations. More generally,
   there is a paucity of guidance on how to partition the variation. As a
   result, applied researchers are likely to avoid or inadequately report
   and discuss the substantive importance of clustering and cluster effects
   in their studies. A recent article drew attention to a little-known
   exact algebraic expression for the VPC/ICC for the special case of the
   two-level random-intercept Poisson model. In this article, we make a
   substantial new contribution. First, we derive exact VPC/ICC expressions
   for more flexible negative binomial models that allows for
   overdispersion, a phenomenon which often occurs in practice. Then we
   derive exact VPC/ICC expressions for three-level and randomcoefficient
   extensions to these models. We illustrate our work with an application
   to student absenteeism.
   Translational Abstract
   Multilevel models (random effects, mixed-effects or hierarchical linear
   models) are now a standard generalization of conventional regression
   models for analyzing clustered and longitudinal data in the social,
   psychological, behavioral, and medical sciences. A natural first step in
   any multilevel analysis is to report the degree of clustering in the
   response because it is the assumed presence of clustering which is the
   fundamental motivation for fitting multilevel models. Confirming that
   there is a statistically significant degree of clustering is not enough.
   One must additionally communicate the practical importance of clustering
   and this is done by reporting variance partition coefficients (VPCs) and
   intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Different VPC and ICC
   expressions have been proposed and are now widely used for multilevel
   continuous, binary, ordinal, and nominal response models. In contrast,
   there has been almost no work for multilevel count response models. In
   this article, we propose new VPC and ICC expressions for both Poisson
   and negative binomial count response models. We then derive VPC/ICC
   expressions for three-level and random-coefficient extensions to these
   models. We illustrate all our work with an application to student
   absenteeism.}},

Abstract = {{In case when the upper part of the medium has complex geological
   structure and geodynamic processes occur in it, the necessity of these
   data increases in projecting of the object under construction.
   Purpose. Studying of acoustic, elastic and anisotropic properties of the
   upper part of section of complicatedly constructed geological media.
   Methodology. Seismic observations are conducted in shallow wells in the
   areas of construction objects located in various seismogeological
   conditions by NSCW (Near-Surface Cross Well testing) method. Field
   seismic records are processed. Kinematic and dynamic parameters of
   pressure and differently polarized shear waves are determined.
   Thin-layered one-dimensional models of physical properties of the medium
   are created and interpreted on the basis of nonlinear theory of
   elastodynamics.
   Results. It is determined that the medium with high porous, water
   saturated rocks and anomalous high reservoir pressure has anomalous low
   value of velocities and gradient of their increase with depth. When this
   medium was re-examined after deep piles were built there, the
   overestimated seismic velocities are obtained, which is explained by a
   decrease in the section of anomalously high reservoir pressure and,
   accordingly, the porosity of the rocks after piles were built. When the
   hollowness is increased in unsaturated pebble rocks, the negative value
   of Poisson's ratio is obtained on the standard method. Seismic
   anisotropy related with the direction of the grains packing of the rocks
   is revealed on velocities of shear waves. The change of property of
   rocks on depth is manifested clearer on frequencies of waves than on
   their amplitudes.
   Scientific novelty. The elasticity moduli of the 3rd order are
   determined which are more sensible to variability of nonlinear elastic
   properties of rocks of the medium than the moduli of the 2nd order. The
   values of Poisson's ratio are recalculated for one and the same rocks
   located in different conditions of rock pressure on the basis of
   nonclassical theory of deformation.
   Practical importance. The obtained results can be applied to study the
   media characterized by complex seismogeological hydrodynamic conditions
   with clay-sandy rocks of high porosity and water saturation.}},

Abstract = {{The 3D printing technology can be applied into manufacturing primary
   shaping diverse products, from models dealing as examples for future
   products that will be produced with another technique, to useful
   objects. Since 3D printing is nowadays significantly slower than other
   possibilities to manufacture items, such as die casting, it is often
   used for small parts that are produced in small numbers or for products
   that cannot be created in another way. Combinations of 3D printing with
   other objects, adding novel functionalities to them, are thus favourable
   to a complete primary shaping process. Textile fabrics belong to the
   objects whose mechanical and other properties can notably be modified by
   adding 3D printed forms. This article mainly reports on a new
   possibility to change the permeability of textile fabrics by 3D printing
   auxetic forms, e.g. for utilising them in textile filters. In addition,
   auxetic forms 3D printed on knitted fabrics can bring about mechanical
   properties that are conducive to tensile constructions.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we propose a simple method of constructing confidence
   intervals for a function of binomial success probabilities and for a
   function of Poisson means. The method involves finding an approximate
   fiducial quantity (FQ) for the parameters of interest. A FQ for a
   function of several parameters can be obtained by substitution. For the
   binomial case, the fiducial approach is illustrated for constructing
   confidence intervals for the relative risk and the ratio of odds.
   Fiducial inferential procedures are also provided for estimating
   functions of several Poisson parameters. In particular, fiducial
   inferential approach is illustrated for interval estimating the ratio of
   two Poisson means and for a weighted sum of several Poisson means.
   Simple approximations to the distributions of the FQs are also given for
   some problems. The merits of the procedures are evaluated by comparing
   them with those of existing asymptotic methods with respect to coverage
   probabilities, and in some cases, expected widths. Comparison studies
   indicate that the fiducial confidence intervals are very satisfactory,
   and they are comparable or better than some available asymptotic
   methods. The fiducial method is easy to use and is applicable to find
   confidence intervals for many commonly used summary indices. Some
   examples are used to illustrate and compare the results of fiducial
   approach with those of other available asymptotic methods. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Many three-dimensional (3D) nanomaterial-based assemblies need

   AgNW conductors exhibit good stability of resistance under multimodal
   deformation, such as stretching, compressing, and bending as well as
   comparable conductivity with those elastomer-based ones. Moreover, the
   buckled structures endow our 3D conductors with novel negative Poisson's

   surfaces. The combination of mechanical properties, conductive

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Chiral-lattice metamaterials with unique mechanical, optical, electrical
   and magnetic properties have been widely used in many engineering
   applications, such as chiral recognition and separation, stealth
   materials and devices, as well as biological sensors. Various design
   strategies have been developed to obtain chiral-lattice metamaterials
   with different mechanical properties. The fast grown design strategies
   that can provide a variety of Poisson?s ratios and elastic moduli have
   brought new opportunities to emerging biomedical appli-cations. In this
   study, hexagonal and tetragonal chiral-lattice metamaterials with
   positive and negative Poisson?s ratios were designed. The design
   strategy was based on a network structure with a periodic lattice
   topology, which was formed by three outer rings connected to the central
   ring via ligaments. The wide appli-cations of this type of metamaterial
   were investigated via experiments and finite-element analysis.
   Demonstrative examples and the shape-memory effect (SME) suggest that
   the chiral-lattice structure has great potential in developing
   programmable metamaterials. The findings of this study provide essential
   guidance for the design of chiral network structures with the desired
   mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{We study generalized linear models for time series of counts, where
   serial dependence is introduced through a dependent latent process in

   the observation is modelled by a negative binomial distribution. To
   estimate the regression coefficients, we maximize the pseudolikelihood
   that is based on a generalized linear model with the latent process
   suppressed. We show the consistency and asymptotic normality of the
   generalized linear model estimator when the latent process is a
   stationary strongly mixing process. We extend the asymptotic results to
   generalized linear models for time series, where the observation
   variable, conditional on covariates and a latent process, is assumed to
   have a distribution from a one-parameter exponential family. Thus, we
   unify in a common framework the results for Poisson log-linear
   regression models of Davis et al. (2000), negative binomial logit

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Distance sampling of events in natural or seminatural populations often
   indicates a larger variance in the distance to the kth nearest event
   than expected for events distributed completely at random.
   Overdispersion contributes to the well-known bias problem of distance
   sampling density estimators. Distance distribution models that
   accommodate overdispersion in the data should lead to more robust
   estimators of density. To this end we propose a gamma-Poisson
   distribution model for distances from a point to k nearest events. The
   model assumes a gamma distribution of local densities of randomly
   distributed events. Properties of the distribution and estimation of the
   parameters and event density are detailed for both constrained and
   unconstrained sampling. Four examples, one with simulated data from a
   known negative binomial distribution and three with simulated distance
   sampling in natural and seminatural stem-mapped tree stands, illustrate
   the promising performance of this new distribution, both as a model for
   distances and for density estimation. The modeling approach extends to
   other mixing distributions.}},

Title = {{Loss of stability: A new look at the physics of cell wall behavior

Abstract = {{In this article we investigate aspects of turgor- driven plant cell
   growth within the framework of a model derived from the Eulerian concept
   of instability. In particular we explore the relationship between cell
   geometry and cell turgor pressure by extending loss of stability theory
   to encompass cylindrical cells. Beginning with an analysis of the three-
   dimensional stress and strain of a cylindrical pressure vessel, we
   demonstrate that loss of stability is the inevitable result of gradually
   increasing internal pressure in a cylindrical cell. The turgor pressure
   predictions based on this model differ from the more traditional
   viscoelastic or creep- based models in that they incorporate both cell
   geometry and wall mechanical properties in a single term. To confirm our
   predicted working turgor pressures, we obtained wall dimensions, elastic
   moduli, and turgor pressures of sequential internodal cells of intact
   Chara corallina plants by direct measurement. The results show that
   turgor pressure predictions based on loss of stability theory fall
   within the expected physiological range of turgor pressures for this
   plant. We also studied the effect of varying wall Poisson's ratio v on
   extension growth in living cells, showing that while increasing elastic
   modulus has an understandably negative effect on wall expansion,
   increasing Poisson's ratio would be expected to accelerate wall
   expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Biological materials exhibiting non-self-similar hierarchical structures
   possess desirable mechanical properties. Motivated by their penetration
   resistance and fracture toughness, the mechanical performance of model
   materials with non-self-similar hierarchical structures was explored and
   the distinct advantages were identified. A numerical model was
   developed, based on microscopic observation of enamel prisms.
   Computational simulations showed that the systems with non-self-similar
   hierarchy displayed lateral expansion when subjected to longitudinal
   tensile loading, which reflected negative Poisson's ratio and potential
   for greater volume strain energies when compared with conventional
   materials with positive Poisson's ratio. Employing the non-self-similar
   hierarchical design, the capability of resilience can be improved.
   Additionally, the non-self-similar hierarchical structure exhibited
   larger toughness, resulting from the large pull-out work of the
   reinforcements. The findings of this study not only elucidate the
   deformation mechanisms of biological materials with non-self-similar
   hierarchical structure, but also provide a new path for bio-inspired
   materials design. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear ion-acoustic double layers (IADLs) in a warm magnetoplasma
   with positive-negative ions and nonthermal electrons are investigated.
   For this purpose, the hydrodynamic equations for the positive-negative
   ions, nonthermal electron density distribution, and the Poisson equation
   are used to derive a modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov (MZK) equation, in the
   small amplitude regime. It is found that compressive and rarefactive
   IADLs strongly depend on the mass and density ratios of the
   negative-to-positive ions as well as the nonthermal electron parameter.
   Also, it is shown that there are one critical value for the density
   ratio of the negative-to-positive ions (nu), the ratio between
   unperturbed electron-to-positive ion density (mu), and the nonthermal
   electron parameter (beta), which decide the existence of positive and
   negative IADLs. The present study is applied to examine the small
   amplitude nonlinear IADL excitations for the and (H+,H-) plasmas, where
   they are found in the D- and F-regions of the Earth's ionosphere. This
   investigation should be helpful in understanding the salient features of
   the nonlinear IADLs in either space or laboratory plasmas where two
   distinct groups of ions and non-Boltzmann distributed electrons are
   present.}},

Abstract = {{This paper attempts to disclose the mechanical behavior and deformation

   of the anchoring resin under thermomechanical coupling, and compares the
   pull-out and rheological performances of the resin anchored layer under
   different temperatures and stresses. The results show that: With the
   increase in test temperature, the anchoring resin witnessed a gradual
   decline in its compressive strength and yield stress, a continuous
   decrease of its elastic modulus, a gradual growth in the Poisson's
   ratio, and a reduction in the yield point; The rheological deformation
   of the anchoring resin is affected by test temperature and stress; There
   is a negative correlation between the ambient temperature and the
   pull-out force needed to displace the anchoring resin by a certain
   distance, under the high temperature environment; In high-temperature,

Title = {{Study on mechanical properties of a hierarchical octet-truss structure}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{249}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{A hierarchical octet-truss lattice material was proposed by replacing
   the solid strut of the octet-truss structure with a tubular re-entrant
   structure. The tubular re-entrant structure was constructed via a sheet
   rolling oper-ation on a planar hexagonal re-entrant structure.
   Hierarchical octet-truss lattice materials with different rela-tive
   densities were fabricated via additive manufacturing by adjusting the
   re-entrant structure rib thickness, and their mechanical properties were
   studied and compared with the finite element model predictions and shown
   to be in excellent agreement with each other. The effects of
   hierarchical ranks on the mechanical prop-erties of structures were also
   discussed. Results showed that the Poisson's ratio of the hierarchical
   octet-truss structure is approximately 0.3 without being affected by the
   introduction of structural hierarchy. The stress -strain relationships
   of the hierarchical octet-truss structures exhibit dual-peak
   characteristic. The lattice stiff-ness, compressive strength, and energy
   absorption capacity of the models increased with an increasing rib
   thickness of the re-entrant structure of the first-order hierarchical
   octet-truss structure, and the maximum value of specific energy
   absorption (SEA) was achieved when the relative density is 30.2\%. The
   second-order hier-archical octet-truss structure exhibited lower
   collapse stress value, and a shorter stress plateau region than those of
   the zeroth and first-order hierarchical octet-truss structures.}},

Title = {{The variation and visualisation of elastic anisotropy in rock-forming
   minerals}},
Journal = {{SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{259-286}},

Abstract = {{All minerals behave elastically; elasticity is a rheological property
   that controls their ability to support stress, strain, and pressure;
   controls the nature of acoustic wave propagation; and influences
   subsequent plastic (i.e. permanent non-reversible) deformation. All
   minerals are intrinsically anisotropic in their elastic properties -
   that is, they have directional variations that are related to the
   configuration of the crystal lattice. This means that the commonly used
   mechanical elastic properties that relate elastic stress to elastic
   strain, including Young's modulus (E), Poisson's ratio (nu), shear
   modulus (G) and linear compressibility (beta), are dependent on
   crystallographic direction. In this paper, we explore the ranges of
   anisotropy of E, nu, G and beta in 86 rock-forming minerals, using
   previously published data, and show that the range is much wider than
   commonly assumed. We also explore how these variations (the
   directionality and the magnitude) are important for fundamental
   processes in the solid earth, including deformation (mechanical)
   twinning, coherent phase transformations and brittle failure. We present
   a new open-source software package (AnisoVis, written in MATLAB), which
   we use to calculate and visualise directional variations in elastic
   properties of rock-forming minerals. Following previous work in the
   fields of chemistry and materials science, we demonstrate that by
   visualising the variations in elasticity, we discover previously
   unreported properties of rock-forming minerals. For example, we show
   previously unreported directions of negative Poisson's ratio and
   negative linear compressibility, and we show that the existence of these
   features is more widespread (i.e. present in many more minerals) than
   previously thought. We illustrate the consequences of intrinsic elastic
   anisotropy for the elastic normal and shear strains within alpha-quartz
   single crystal under different applied stress fields; the role of
   elastic anisotropy on Dauphine twinning and the alpha-beta phase
   transformations in quartz; and stress distributions around voids of
   different shapes in talc, lizardite, albite, and sanidine. In addition
   to our specific examples, elastic anisotropy in rock-forming minerals,
   to the degree that we describe, has significant consequences for seismic
   (acoustic) anisotropy, for the focal mechanisms of earthquakes in
   anisotropic source regions (e.g. subducting slabs), for a range of
   brittle and ductile deformation mechanisms in minerals, and for
   geobarometry using mineral inclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetite exhibits unique structural, electronic, and magnetic
   properties in extreme conditions that are of great research interest. In
   this work, the effects of preparation technique on X-ray peak
   broadening, magnetic and elastic moduli properties of Fe3O4
   nanoparticles prepared by coprecipitation (FcP-NPs) and citrate (FC-NPs)
   methods have been investigated. The structural characterization of the
   samples is evidence for a cubic structure with Fd-3m space group. The
   Williamson-Hall analysis was used to study crystallite sizes and lattice
   strain of the samples and also stress and energy density. In addition,
   the crystallite sizes are compared with the particle sizes and the
   magnetic core sizes obtained from TEM and VSM methods, respectively. In
   addition, the cation distribution obtained from calculated inversion
   parameter indicate that in the smaller particles, more amount of Fe2+ on
   the tetrahedral sites can be related to higher stress induced in the
   FcP-NPs compared to the FC-NPs. The saturation magnetization of the
   FcP-NPs is almost two times bigger than the saturation magnetization of
   the FC-NPs. It could be attributed to the decrease in the negative
   interaction on the octahedral site and also the magnetic moment on the
   tetrahedral site of the FcP-NPs. The increase in force constants of the
   FC-NPs determined by infrared spectra analysis compared to FcP-NPs
   suggests the strengthening of their interatomic bonding. The values of
   shear and longitudinal wave velocities obtained from force constants
   have been used to determine the values of Young's modulus, rigidity
   modulus, bulk modulus, and Debye temperature. By comparison of the
   elastic results of FC-NPs with the FcP-NPs, we can observe that the
   elastic properties of the F-NPs have been improved by synthesis method,
   while Poisson's ratio almost remains constant. In addition, using the
   values of the compliance s(ij) obtained from elastic stiffness
   constants, the values of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio along the
   oriented direction {[}hkl] have been calculated for the samples.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The development of multi-stable structural forms has attracted
   considerable attention in the design of architected multi-materials,
   metamaterials, and morphing structures, as a result of some unusual
   properties such as negative stiffness and, possibly, negative Poisson's
   ratio. Multi-stability is achieved through a morphological change of
   shape upon loading, and in doing so multi-stable structures undergo
   transitions from one equilibrium state to another. This paper
   investigates the structural performance of the negative stiffness
   honeycomb (NSH) metamaterials made of double curved beams which are
   emerging in various applications such as sensors, actuators, and
   lightweight impact protective structures with structural tunability and
   recoverability. An analytical treatment is pursued using the
   Euler-Lagrange theorem and the stability of the honeycomb has been
   studied. Based on a static analysis of the nonlinear elastic system, the
   developed tangent stiffness matrix and ensuing deformation curve were
   assessed through multiple phases of deformation. The closed-form
   solution was in good agreement with the numerical finite element (FE)
   model at different bistability ratios. It was shown that the bistability
   ratio had a pronounced effect on the overall response of the honeycomb
   and the desired negativity in the stiffness matrix could be achieved
   with high bistability ratios.}},

Abstract = {{A novel three-dimensional lattice based on a generalization of the
   anti-tetrachiral geometry is presented and investigated using
   experimental, numerical, and analytical methods. The lattice is built
   through the use of a novel connectivity that is not only able to
   transmit the force imposed to other orthogonal directions but also
   induce a contraction in these other directions when uniaxially
   compressed. The experimental results for a specific geometry confirmed
   that the structure behaves auxetically when compressed along the Ox(1)
   direction. The parametric behavior of the structure is investigated
   using commercially available finite element software with the
   methodology being validated using experimental results. The results
   indicate that the structure will have a negative Poisson's ratio in all
   directions with the magnitude depending on the relative lengths of the
   ligaments, their thickness, and to a minor extent, their width. An
   analytical model is also derived and tested against the experimental and
   numerical results showing good agreement.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a data-driven approach to predict mechanical
   properties of auxetic kirigami metamaterials with randomly oriented

   estimation of auxetic behavior of kirigami metamaterials is
   straightforward. Our examples indicate that if the distributions of
   training and test datasets are close to each other, a good prediction is
   achievable. Our efforts provide a fast and reliable way to evaluate the

Abstract = {{Herein, the structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of Pd
   doped with Ti under different pressures are studied, using
   first-principles calculations. The formation enthalpy is negative,
   demonstrating that the structure of the Pd-Ti alloy is thermodynamically
   stable. The corresponding mechanical stability conditions prove that the
   Pd-Ti alloy is mechanically stable. Moreover, the shear modulus, bulk
   modulus, ratios of bulk modulus to shear modulus, hardness, and
   Poisson's ratio are calculated. The results indicate that the hardness,
   ductility, and plasticity of the Pd-Ti alloy improve. In addition, the
   density of states, bond population, and Debye temperature as functions
   of pressure are investigated, revealing that the Pd-Ti alloy is metallic
   and the pressure does not make a huge change to the structure of the
   Pd-Ti alloy and makes the thermal conductivity and interatomic bonding
   of the Pd-Ti alloy improved. Theoretical basis is also provided for
   further research on Pd-based alloys which probably have good prospects
   for superalloys.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to investigate the association
   between the milk fat-protein ratio and the incidence rate of clinical
   mastitis including repeated cases of clinical mastitis to determine the
   usefulness of this association to monitor metabolic disorders as risk
   factors for udder health. Herd records from 10 dairy herds of Holstein
   cows in Saxony, Germany, from September 2005-2011(36,827 lactations of
   17,657 cows) were used for statistical analysis. A mixed Poisson
   regression model with the weekly incidence rate of clinical mastitis as
   outcome variable was fitted. The model included repeated events of the
   outcome, time-varying covariates and multilevel clustering. Because the
   recording of clinical mastitis might have been imperfect, a
   probabilistic bias analysis was conducted to assess the impact of the
   misclassification of clinical mastitis on the conventional results.
   The lactational incidence of clinical mastitis was 38.2\%. In 36.2\% and
   34.9\% of the lactations, there was at least one dairy herd test day
   with a fat-protein ratio of <1.0 or >1.5, respectively.
   Misclassification of clinical mastitis was assumed to have resulted in
   bias towards the null. A clinical mastitis case increased the incidence
   rate of following cases of the same cow. Fat-protein ratios of <1.0 and
   >1.5 were associated with higher incidence rates of clinical mastitis
   depending on week in milk. The effect of a fat-protein ratio >1.5 on the
   incidence rate of clinical mastitis increased considerably over the
   course of lactation, whereas the effect of a fat-protein ratio <1.0
   decreased. Fat-protein ratios <1.0 or >1.5 on the precedent test days of
   all cows irrespective of their time in milk seemed to be better
   predictors for clinical mastitis than the first test day results per
   lactation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the challenges in the harnessing of energy and the
   continuing trend of miniaturizing devices, an exhaustive evaluation of
   the electronic, mechanical and piezoelectric properties of surface
   modified penta-graphene (PG), including fluorinated PG (F-PG-F),
   hydrofluorinated PG (H-PG-F) and hydrogenated PG (H-PG-H), was carried
   out via a first-principles approach based on density functional theory.
   We first predicted the H-PG-F system and calculated its phonon
   dispersion and magnetic properties. All three systems were found to
   exhibit an e(31) piezoelectric effect, and the e(31) (96.88 pC m(-1))
   effect of H-PG-F was found to be much greater than that of the other two
   systems. So, it could be concluded that hydrofluorination can
   significantly enhance the piezoelectric properties of PG. The binding
   energy and formation energy of the H-PG-F system were found to be the
   lowest among the three surface modified PG systems, showing that the
   H-PG-F system is the most energetically favorable state. The e(31)
   piezoelectricity can be potentially engineered into a PG monolayer by
   surface modification, providing an avenue for monolithic integration of
   electronic and electromechanical devices with a PG monolayer for use in
   mechanical stress-sensors, nano-sized actuators and energy harvesting
   systems. The H-PG-F system stands out in terms of its combination of a
   larger piezoelectric coefficient (e(31) = 96.88 pC m(-1)), negative
   Poisson's ratio and low formation energy (-3.37 eV) and is recommended
   for experimental exploration.}},

Abstract = {{Rate differences are an important effect measure in biostatistics and
   provide an alternative perspective to rate ratios. When the data are
   event counts observed during an exposure period, adjusted rate
   differences may be estimated using an identity-link Poisson generalised
   linear model, also known as additive Poisson regression. A problem with
   this approach is that the assumption of equality of mean and variance
   rarely holds in real data, which often show overdispersion. An additive
   negative binomial model is the natural alternative to account for this;
   however, standard model-fitting methods are often unable to cope with
   the constrained parameter space arising from the non-negativity
   restrictions of the additive model. In this paper, we propose a novel
   solution to this problem using a variant of the expectation-conditional
   maximisation-either algorithm. Our method provides a reliable way to fit
   an additive negative binomial regression model and also permits flexible
   generalisations using semi-parametric regression functions. We
   illustrate the method using a placebo-controlled clinical trial of
   fenofibrate treatment in patients with type II diabetes, where the
   outcome is the number of laser therapy courses administered to treat
   diabetic retinopathy. An R package is available that implements the
   proposed method. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICA SCRIPTA}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Microtubules are protein-based filaments that carry out essential
   biological roles of eukaryotic cells. They play,in vivo, critical roles
   in a wide variety of physical situations such as maintaining cell shape,
   supporting cellular motions, and playing significant roles in both
   intracellular transport and cellular division. To perform some of these
   functions, microtubules may need to form different topologies in various
   orientations. Therefore, the need to introduce different structures of
   microtubules arises. Orientation-dependent architected structures are a
   type of periodic architected materials that can exhibit various
   mechanical properties in different orientations. In the present study,
   several periodic architectures of various topologies are investigated
   numerically, and their mechanical properties (elastic modulus, Poisson's
   ratio, and natural frequencies) are analyzed in different spatial
   orientations. For this purpose, the representative volume elements are
   constructed by considering unit cells of different models aligned in
   different spatial angles, and their elastic moduli and Poisson's ratios
   are obtained by the finite element method. Then the finite element
   equation of motion for the given structures are solved to find their six
   natural frequencies. Besides, Bloch's theorem is implemented to study
   wave propagation and compare the bandgap widths of the structures in
   different orientations. It is found that while the elastic properties of
   some architected structures may increase as the orientation angle
   increases from zero, for some others, a reduction in the elastic moduli
   can be observed as the angle rises. Further, it is seen that some
   structures may exhibit positive (and high) values of Poisson's ratio in
   some angles, while for a different orientation, these values turn out to
   be negative. Also, the effects of orientation angle on the natural
   frequencies and stop-band performance are observed to be significant in
   some topologies and negligible in some others. A better understanding of
   the behavior of architected structures in different orientations may
   provide new ways to design and manufacture various structures with
   enhanced and tunable mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Polarization evolution with space and time in HfO2 based
   metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal (MFIM) structure is studied based on
   the phase field model by self-consistently solving the two-dimensional
   time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau and Poisson equations. Through examining
   the domain wall and electrostatic (depolarization) energies compared
   with the negative ferroelectric (FE) anisotropy energy, the correlation
   between the domain pattern (phase transition) and negative capacitance
   (NC) effect is revealed for different structure parameters and material
   properties, including FE thickness and gradient coefficient, dielectric
   permittivity and thickness, and operation frequency of applied voltage.
   The design space for stabilized NC with (near) hysteresis-free operation
   accompanied with voltage amplification is limited by phase transition,
   implying the potentials and limitations of FE HfO2 for energy-efficient
   steep-slope devices.}},

Title = {{Hinge-like structure induced unusual properties of black phosphorus and
   new strategies to improve the thermoelectric performance}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{We systematically investigated the geometric, electronic and
   thermoelectric (TE) properties of bulk black phosphorus (BP) under
   strain. The hinge-like structure of BP brings unusual mechanical
   responses such as anisotropic Young's modulus and negative Poisson's
   ratio. A sensitive electronic structure of BP makes it transform among
   metal, direct and indirect semiconductors under strain. The maximal
   figure of merit ZT of BP is found to be 0.72 at 800 K that could be
   enhanced to 0.87 by exerting an appropriate strain, revealing BP could
   be a potential medium-high temperature TE material. Such strain-induced
   enhancements of TE performance are often observed to occur at the
   boundary of the direct-indirect band gap transition, which can be
   attributed to the increase of degeneracy of energy valleys at the
   transition point. By comparing the structure of BP with SnSe, a family
   of potential TE materials with hinge-like structure are suggested. This
   study not only exposes various novel properties of BP under strain, but
   also proposes effective strategies to seek for better TE materials.}},

Abstract = {{A novel tetrachiral and antitetrachiral hybrid metastructure is

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials can be designed to give rise to exotic
   properties such as negative stiffness, negative Poisson's ratio
   (auxeticity), and tailorable buckling by selectively designing the
   geometry of the host material. However, these behaviors are typically
   fixed and cannot be changed once the metamaterial has been fabricated.
   Motivated by the goal of post-manufactured application-specific
   adaptability, we present a soft mechanical metamaterial with pressurized
   circular voids for in-situ tunable mechanical properties. Prototypes are
   created by curing a two-component silicone rubber in a 3D printed mold.
   The circular voids are sealed at one end and independently connected to
   a pressure source on the opposite side, allowing any subset of the voids
   to be pressurized. Uniaxial compression tests are then conducted on a
   universal testing machine. Through selective pressurization of the
   voids, we demonstrate tunability of the material's stiffness profiles
   and the critical loads that lead to the onset of auxeticity and/or
   buckling. Numerical investigations allow deeper insight, revealing that
   selective pressurization affects the qualitative shape of the first
   buckling mode and illustrating how pressurization can break the auxetic
   behavior of the nominal, unpressurized specimen. Overall, the outcomes
   demonstrate that soft elastomers with selectively pressurized voids can
   express quantitatively and qualitatively tunable responses, offering
   potential for new types of mechanical metamaterials with predictable,
   in-situ tunability.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials have attracted tremendous interests, owing to
   their fruitfulness of underlying physics and mechanics as well as
   diverse potential applications. Conventional soft mechanical
   metamaterials contain periodic distribution of holes having identical
   sizes, which can only display one mechanical function. Periodically
   dispersing a regular pattern of through-holes with two sizes into an
   elastomer results in metamaterials with more mechanical functions and
   deformation scenarios. We numerically investigate the deformation
   behaviors of this type of metamaterials. Switching of modes from the
   buckling-dominated deformation to a loss-of-instability deformation is
   emphasized. Replacing the pattern of holes with the same sizes by a
   pattern of holes with two sizes imposes higher compliance and even loss
   of negative Poisson's ratio of the material.}},

Abstract = {{Stretchable and conductive hydrogels have been intensively studied as
   wearable electronics to monitor the physiological activities of human
   bodies. However, it remains a challenge to fabricate robust hydrogels as
   sensors with complex 3D structures. Here, we designed a 3D printable ink
   from cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), deep eutectic solvents (DESs), and
   ionically cross-linked polyacrylic acid (PAA). DESs composed of choline
   chloride and ethylene glycol served as a nonvolatile medium with high
   ionic conductivity. The dispersion of CNCs in a mixture of DESs, acrylic
   acid, and Al3+ ions formed ionogels with a reversible physical network
   for 3D printing. After the printing process, the ionogel was solidified
   by the photopolymerization of acrylic acid in the presence of Al3+ ions
   to form a second ionically cross-linked network. The first physical
   network of CNCs provides an energy-dissipating mechanism to make a
   strong and highly stretchable nanocomposite ionogel. When compared to
   hydrogels, we found that the DES/CNC nanocomposite ionogel was more
   stable in the air because of the low volatility of DESs. We further used
   the DES/CNC ink to 3D print an auxetic sensor with negative Poisson's
   ratios so that the sensor provided a conformal contact with the skin
   during large deformation. In addition, the auxetic sensor could
   continuously monitor and identify different motions of the human body by
   the change in resistance. These results demonstrate a simple and rapid
   strategy to fabricate stable and sensitive strain sensors from cheap and
   renewable feedstock.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of deep energy resources, understanding variations
   in the physical and mechanical properties of rocks at different depths
   is significant. In this paper, core samples from ten different burial
   depths (1000 m, 1300 m, 1600 m, 1850 m, 2600 m, 3500 m, 4800 m, 5100 m,
   5600 m, and 6400 m) were collected from the Songke No. 2 (SK-2) well and
   the Daqing Oilfield. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   study involving the physical property and uniaxial compression testing
   of rock cores from such a large range of burial depths. The experimental
   results show that the content of weak phase minerals decreases with
   increasing depth. The change in the hard phase minerals varies
   nonlinearly with depth. From 3500 to 5600 m, the content of hard phase
   minerals decreases, while the content of the middle phase minerals
   increases. The elastic modulus exponentially increases with increasing
   depth, while Poisson's ratio decreases with increasing depth.
   Additionally, the uniaxial compressive strength displays a nonlinear
   logarithmic increase with increasing depth. Finally, the effects of
   petrophysical properties on the mechanical behavior of rock at different
   depths are discussed. The elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, and
   compressive strength all have a negative correlation with the content of
   weak phase minerals. These results have important value for studying the
   mechanics of rocks at different depths.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate distributions are more and more used to model the
   dependence encountered in many fields. However, classical multivariate
   distributions can be restrictive by their nature, while Sarmanov's
   multivariate distribution, by joining different marginals in a flexible
   and tractable dependence structure, often provides a valuable
   alternative. In this paper, we introduce some bivariate mixed Sarmanov
   distributions with the purpose to extend the class of bivariate Sarmanov
   distributions and to obtain new dependency structures. Special attention
   is paid to the bivariate mixed Sarmanov distribution with Poisson
   marginals and, in particular, to the resulting bivariate Sarmanov
   distributions with negative binomial and with Poisson-inverse Gaussian
   marginals; these particular types of mixed distributions have possible
   applications in, for example modelling bivariate count data. The
   extension to higher dimensions is also discussed. Moreover, concerning
   the dependency structure, we also present some correlation formulas.}},

Abstract = {{The structural and elastic properties as well as phonon-dispersion
   relations of the Heusler-type alloys Fe2VAl and Fe2VGa are computed
   using density functional and density-functional perturbation theory
   within the generalized-gradient approximation. The calculated
   equilibrium lattice constants agree well with the experimental values.
   The elastic constants of Fe2VAl and Fe2VGa are predicted. From the
   elastic constants the shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio,
   sound velocities, and Debye temperatures are obtained. By analyzing the
   ratio between the bulk and shear moduli, we conclude that both Fe2VAl
   and Fe2VGa are brittle in nature. The computed phonon-dispersion
   relation shows that both compounds are dynamically stable in the L2(1)
   structure without any imaginary phonon frequencies. The isomer shifts in
   Fe in the two compounds are discussed in terms of the Fe s partial
   density of states, which reveal larger ionicity/less hybridization in
   Fe2VGa than in Fe2VAl. For the same reason the Cauchy pressure is
   negative in Fe2VAl but positive in Fe2VGa.}},

Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing technologies such as fused filament fabrication

   low-velocity impact conditions. The finite-element method (FEM) was
   used, and appropriate constitutive models were fitted to static and
   dynamic tensile and compressive data of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
   (ABS) tested under various strain rates. A Johnson-Cook plasticity model
   demonstrated the best compromise between accuracy and computational
   efficiency. A simulation strategy using explicit FEM was developed to
   simulate additively manufactured auxetic metastructures under impact
   conditions. There was good agreement between the model prediction and
   the experimentally observed structural response. A parametric
   optimization was implemented to enhance the energy absorption capability
   with low acceleration peaks of a graded auxetic re-entrant structure for

Abstract = {{Thermoplastic composite structures are being widely investigated due to
   their excellent properties such as recycling feasibility and high damage

   efficiency can be risen from 0.4 to 0.7 after optimizing the placement
   mode of axial ribs. The deformation of HTCHCS were experimentally
   studied and typical deformation modes were obtained. Different from the
   layer-by-layer collapse for HTCHCS with regular ribs, HTCHCS with
   staggered ribs showed negative Poisson' ratio deformation. After large
   imposed crushing displacement (at least 90\%), excellent deformation
   recovery over 80\% initial height was found and reloading carrying and
   energy absorption abilities can reach to 13\% and 12\% of initial ones

Abstract = {{The Phase stability, electronic structure, elastic properties and

   and formation enthalpy show that these compounds are thermodynamically
   stable, and Ru-Ir alloys tend to exist in the form of Ru5Ir15, Ru6Ir14
   and Ru8Ir12. The calculated results of electronic structure reveal that
   strong hybridizations exist near the Fermi level, being characteristic

   the highest hardness, and Ru8Ir12 compound has the maximal elastic

Abstract = {{The effects of high pressure on mechanical properties and electronic
   structures of Ni-Mo binary compounds (Ni4Mo, Ni3Mo(DOa), Ni3Mo(DO22),
   Ni2Mo) have been studied by first-principles calculation based on
   density functional theory. The results show that the values of V/Vo
   decrease with the pressure increasing and the rates of change decrease
   gradually. The formation enthalpy is negative, and it decreases with
   pressure increasing, indicating high pressure can enhance the ability of
   alloying. The calculated results of bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G),
   Young's modulus (E), Lama constant (lambda) and hardness (H) illustrate
   that pressure can increase the resistance to deformation, compression
   resistance and hardness of four compounds. In addition, ratio of bulk
   modulus to shear modulus (B/G) and poisson's ratio (v) show that all the
   compounds are ductile and plastic. The state density was also analyzed
   to explain the physical origin of the pressure effect on four compounds.
   It is suggested that the increasing pressure can improve the stability
   and hardness of all compounds.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter considers the effect of Poisson's ratio on lateral
   deformation in longitudinal waves in prismatic bars, and the consequent
   density change. A non-dimensionalization is adopted herein such that the
   dimensionless velocity of longitudinal wave is constant with Poisson's
   ratio. Based on this non-dimensionalization, incorporation of density
   correction and/or lateral inertia using the strength of materials
   approach gives a dimensionless velocity that decreases and increases
   with Poisson's ratio for tensile and compressive loads, respectively,
   such that the pivot conditions take place at v = 0.5 considering density
   correction only, at v = 0 considering lateral inertia only, and at v =
   0.25 considering both corrections. An analogy is then extended to the
   case of plane waves of dilatation, in which only density correction is
   required. Thereafter, a revisit to the lateral inertia of Love rods
   provides the combined effect of density, Young's modulus, Poisson's
   ratio, polar radius of gyration and wave number on the velocity of
   longitudinal waves in Love rods.}},

Abstract = {{Pursuing two-dimensional (2D) intrinsic ferromagnetism with high Curie
   temperature and great mechanical flexibility has attracted great
   interest in flexible spintronics. In the present work, we carried out a
   density functional theory (DFT) investigation on the 2D M2Se3 (M = Co,
   Ni, and Pd) monolayers to understand their structural stabilities,
   electronic, magnetic and mechanical properties. Our results show that
   the Co2Se3 monolayer exhibits a fascinating half-metallic ferromagnetism
   with high Curie temperature (similar to 600 K). In addition, due to
   their unique buckling hinge-like structure, M2Se3 monolayers possess the
   large out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and superior
   mechanical flexibility evidenced by their unusual critical strain
   (similar to 50\%-60\%) two times greater than the well-known 2D
   materials. These findings imply that 2D M2Se3 family is the promising
   materials for the applications in the flexible and high-density

Abstract = {{Model lattices consisting of balls connected by central-force springs
   provide much of our understanding of mechanical response and phonon
   structure of real materials. Their stability depends critically on their
   coordination number z. d-dimensional lattices with z = 2d are at the
   threshold of mechanical stability and are isostatic. Lattices with z <
   2d exhibit zero-frequency ``floppy{''} modes that provide avenues for
   lattice collapse. The physics of systems as diverse as architectural
   structures, network glasses, randomly packed spheres, and biopolymer
   networks is strongly influenced by a nearby isostatic lattice. We
   explore elasticity and phonons of a special class of two-dimensional
   isostatic lattices constructed by distorting the kagome lattice. We show
   that the phonon structure of these lattices, characterized by vanishing
   bulk moduli and thus negative Poisson ratios (equivalently, auxetic
   elasticity), depends sensitively on boundary conditions and on the
   nature of the kagome distortions. We construct lattices that under free
   boundary conditions exhibit surface floppy modes only or a combination
   of both surface and bulk floppy modes; and we show that bulk floppy
   modes present under free boundary conditions are also present under
   periodic boundary conditions but that surface modes are not. In the
   long-wavelength limit, the elastic theory of all these lattices is a
   conformally invariant field theory with holographic properties
   (characteristics of the bulk are encoded on the sample boundary), and
   the surface waves are Rayleigh waves. We discuss our results in relation
   to recent work on jammed systems. Our results highlight the importance
   of network architecture in determining floppy-mode structure.}},

Abstract = {{The current work suggests a mathematical model for the dynamic response
   of sandwich plates subjected to a blast load using a numerical method.
   The sandwich structure is made from an auxetic honeycomb core layer
   integrated by multiphase nanocomposite facesheets. The facesheets are
   composed of polymer-carbon nanotube (CNT)-fiber where the equivalent
   material properties of the multiphase nanocomposite layers are obtained
   using fiber micromechanics and Halpin-Tsai equations in hierarchy. The
   top and bottom layers are subjected to magnetic field and the material
   properties of them are assumed temperature and moisture dependent. The
   Kelvin-Voigt model is employed to consider the viscoelastic properties
   of the structure. The sandwich structure is rested on a viscoelastic
   foundation which is modeled by orthotropic visco-Pasternak medium. Based
   on refined zigzag theory (RZT), energy method and Hamilton's principle,
   the motion equations are derived. A new numerical method, namely
   differential cubature method (DCM) in conjunction with Newmark method is
   utilized for obtaining the dynamic deflection of the structure for
   different boundary conditions. The effects of various parameters such as
   blast load, viscoelastic foundation, structural damping, magnetic field,
   volume fraction of CNTs, temperature and moisture changes, geometrical
   parameters of honeycomb layer and sandwich plate are considered on the
   dynamic deflection of the structure. The results show that the magnetic
   field to the facesheets can be considered as effective parameters to
   control the dynamic deflection. In addition, hygrothermal condition
   leads to increase of 24\% in the dynamic displacement of system.}},

Abstract = {{Thin-walled metamaterials based on triply periodic surfaces are
   relatively simple, light-weight structures that, as shown in the
   following, possess extraordinary material properties. As opposed to
   their filled counterparts, these structures can be tuned to be
   elastically isotropic and isotropically auxetic- the latter is the
   material property of extending in all directions under tensile loading
   in one direction. Considering level surfaces topologically equivalent to
   the triply periodic minimal surfaces of types Primitive, Diamond, Gyroid
   and I-WP, we focus on stiffness, symmetry, auxeticity, Cauchy pressure
   and proximity to Born mechanical instability. Our findings show that
   core-shell structures respond drastically differently not only in their
   stiffness but also for each of these observed properties compared to
   their counterparts with complete filling. Only core-shell topology makes
   elastic isotropy possible. Diamond core-shell structures are the only
   ones which show negative Cauchy pressure p(c) < 0. Most notably, for the
   Diamond core-shell structures we observe an auxetic behavior spanning
   over the whole range from non-auxetic to isotropically auxetic. For the
   structures possessing auxeticity, negativity in the Poisson's ratio is
   retained for a wide deformation range spanning from small-strain tension
   to large-strain compression. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

   250 degrees C, six columns at 500 degrees C, and six columns at 750
   degrees C) for 2 hr. The obtained results clearly showed that each axial
   load resistance, toughness, and stiffness were all negatively affected
   by escalated temperature degrees. Also, the confinement effectiveness in
   terms of the ultimate load was decreased with the increase in concrete
   compressive strength (un-damaged). The number of ASWM layers
   significantly influenced the ductility, energy absorption, and ultimate
   load improvement percentage. The number of the ASWM layers considerably
   enhanced the ductility up to a certain number of erected layers;
   however, adding more layers had no apparent effect.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze thousands of receiver-function data recorded by 43 temporary
   seismic stations to reveal the crustal structure beneath the Nuomin
   River volcanoes in Northeast China. The H-k method is applied to measure
   crustal depth and average V-p/V-s ratio. Results show that the crustal
   thickness of this area varies from 32 km to 38 km. The Moho depth is
   relatively larger in the west, decreasing significantly to similar to 32
   km beneath the volcanoes and adjacent areas, then increasing slowly to
   similar to 35 km. The crust is thin in NNW direction, consistent with
   the trend of the volcanic belt centered at Wudalianchi. The region
   nearby Wudalianchi volcanoes has an average V-p/V-s ratio of 1. 80,
   higher than in the west part of the study area, extending towards Nuomin
   River volcanoes and Xiaoguli River volcanoes. Research suggests that the
   delamination of K-rich lithosphere mantle triggered the upwelling of
   magma in Northeast China. Negative correlation between crustal thickness
   and Poisson's ratio is thought to result from simultaneous underplating
   of mafic magmas from upper mantle into crust which has likely modified
   crustal composition during Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectonic extension.}},

   Matrix Factorization}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{1614-1626}},
Abstract = {{Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a well-established
   class of methods for the analysis of non-negative data. In particular, a
   lot of effort has been devoted to probabilistic NMF, namely estimation
   or inference tasks in probabilistic models describing the data, based
   for example on Poisson or exponential likelihoods. When dealing with
   time series data, several works have proposed to model the evolution of
   the activation coefficients as a non-negative Markov chain, most of the
   time in relation with the Gamma distribution, giving rise to so-called
   temporal NMF models. In this paper, we review four Gamma Markov chains
   of the NMF literature, and show that they all share the same drawback:
   the absence of a well-defined stationary distribution. We then introduce
   a fifth process, an overlooked model of the time series literature named
   BGAR(1), which overcomes this limitation. These temporal NMF models are
   then compared in a MAP framework on a prediction task, in the context of
   the Poisson likelihood.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating the size of an elusive target population is of prominent
   interest in many areas in the life and social sciences. Our aim is to
   provide an efficient and workable method to estimate the unknown
   population size, given the frequency distribution of counts of repeated
   identifications of units of the population of interest. This counting
   variable is necessarily zero-truncated, since units that have never been
   identified are not in the sample. We consider several applications:
   clinical medicine, where interest is in estimating patients with
   adenomatous polyps which have been overlooked by the diagnostic
   procedure; drug user studies, where interest is in estimating the number
   of hidden drug users which are not identified; veterinary surveillance
   of scrapie in the UK, where interest is in estimating the hidden amount
   of scrapie; and entomology and microbial ecology, where interest is in
   estimating the number of unobserved species of organisms. In all these
   examples, simple models such as the homogenous Poisson are not
   appropriate since they do not account for present and latent
   heterogeneity. The Poisson-Gamma (negative binomial) model provides a
   flexible alternative and often leads to well-fitting models. It has a
   long history and was recently used in the development of the Chao-Bunge
   estimator. Here we use a different property of the Poisson-Gamma model:
   if we consider ratios of neighboring Poisson-Gamma probabilities, then
   these are linearly related to the counts of repeated identifications.
   Also, ratios have the useful property that they are identical for
   truncated and untruncated distributions. In this paper we propose a
   weighted logarithmic regression model to estimate the zero frequency
   counts, assuming a Gamma-Poisson distribution for the counts. A detailed
   explanation about the chosen weights and a goodness of fit index are
   presented, along with extensions to other distributions. To evaluate the
   proposed estimator, we applied it to the benchmark examples mentioned
   above, and we compared the results with those obtained through the
   Chao-Bunge and other estimators. The major benefits of the proposed
   estimator are that it is defined under mild conditions, whereas the
   Chao-Bunge estimator fails to be well defined in several of the examples
   presented; in cases where the Chao-Bunge estimator is defined, its
   behavior is comparable to the proposed estimator in terms of Bias and
   MSE as a simulation study shows. Furthermore, the proposed estimator is
   relatively insensitive to inclusion or exclusion of large outlying
   frequencies, while sensitivity to outliers is characteristic of most
   other methods. The implications and limitations of such methods are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We compared several modeling strategies for vaccine adverse event count
   data in which the data are characterized by excess zeroes and
   heteroskedasticity. Count data are routinely modeled using Poisson and
   Negative Binomial ( NB) regression but zero-inflated and hurdle models
   may be advantageous in this setting. Here we compared the fit of the
   Poisson, Negative Binomial ( NB), zero-inflated Poisson ( ZIP),
   zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB), Poisson Hurdle (PH), and
   Negative Binomial Hurdle (NBH) models. In general, for public health
   studies, we may conceptualize zero-inflated models as allowing zeroes to
   arise from at-risk and not-at-risk populations. In contrast, hurdle
   models may be conceptualized as having zeroes only from an at-risk
   population. Our results illustrate, for our data, that the ZINB and NBH
   models are preferred but these models are indistinguishable with respect
   to fit. Choosing between the zero-inflated and hurdle modeling
   framework, assuming Poisson and NB models are inadequate because of
   excess zeroes, should generally be based on the study design and
   purpose. If the study's purpose is inference then modeling framework
   should be considered. For example, if the study design leads to count
   endpoints with both structural and sample zeroes then generally the
   zero-inflated modeling framework is more appropriate, while in contrast,
   if the endpoint of interest, by design, only exhibits sample zeroes ( e.
   g., at risk participants) then the hurdle model framework is generally
   preferred. Conversely, if the study's primary purpose it is to develop a
   prediction model then both the zero-inflated and hurdle modeling
   frameworks should be adequate.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative sandwich structure with auxetic re-entrant cell honeycomb
   cores was proposed in this paper, and the dynamic responses and blast
   resistance of the honeycomb sandwich structures under blast loading were
   investigated numerically by employing the LS-DYNA. The honeycomb
   structures with thicker walls have a higher plateau force and specific
   energy absorption (SEA) under the compression loading. Deformation modes
   and deflections distribution along the axis direction caused by plastic
   stretching and bending were investigated in detail to have a better
   understanding of the deformation mechanism. Results show that the
   sandwich structures have a higher ability of resisting deformation along
   the longitudinal(Y)-direction than the transverse(X)-direction. In
   addition, the dynamic responses of honeycomb sandwich structures with
   different stand-off distances, graded cores and arranged orientations
   were studied. Results show that both the graded honeycomb cores and
   cross-arranged honeycomb cores can significantly improve the resistance
   ability of the sandwich structures under blast loading, compared with
   the ungraded honeycomb cores and regular-arranged cores.
   Comprehensively, the cross-arranged graded honeycomb cores with higher
   density of the upper layer performs the best under the blast loading
   compared with the other configurations, taking the effects of graded
   cores and arranged orientations into consideration. This work provides a
   reliable basis to design the sandwich structures with auxetic re-entrant
   cell honeycomb cores under compression and blast loading. (C) 2016

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{263}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Lightweight meta-structures can reveal combinations of properties that
   do not occur in conventional structures. In this paper, a 2D bi-material
   unit cell is proposed based on a re-entrant architecture. Two 3D unit
   cells, socalled star and cubic architectures, are then constructed using
   the proposed 2D unit cell. Finally, lattice-based unit cells are
   periodically arranged to develop a meta-structure. The thermo-mechanical
   functionalities of the developed meta-lattices can be programmed by
   tailoring either architectural parameters (i.e., strut length, diameter,
   shape, and orientation) or the material combination of struts. The
   influence of the architectural parameters and material combinations on
   the effective elastic stiffness, Poisson's ratio (PR), and coefficient
   of thermal expansion (CTE) is systematically investigated. A finite
   element (FE) model is established to perform a goal-driven
   multi-objective optimization and to attain an uncommon combination of PR
   and CTE (e.g. negative PR up to ?1.8 or near-zero CTE) with
   uncompromised stiffness. Despite the complicated design (many struts are
   diagonal with respect to the printing bed), the low-cost additive
   manufacturing process (i.e., fused filament fabrication) parameters are
   optimized to fabricate a selected number of bi-material meta-lattices
   with a reasonable time and quality. By employing the FE model, the
   optimized architectural parameters are determined for a series of
   applied engineering applications such as structurally robust aerospace
   structures, energy absorbable structural elements, and shape
   transforming structures. The developed lightweight meta-lattices with
   tunable thermo-mechanical properties can offer the material selection
   charts with more economical material options for engineering
   applications such as antennas and precision instruments.}},

Abstract = {{Oesophageal cancer is the ninth leading cause of malignant cancer death
   and its prognosis remains poor. Dysphagia which is an inability to
   swallow is a presenting symptom of oesophageal cancer and is indicative
   of incurability. The goal of this study was to design and manufacture an
   Auxetic structure film and to configure this film as an Auxetic stent
   for the palliative treatment of oesophageal cancer, and for the
   prevention of dysphagia. Polypropylene was used as a material for its
   flexibility and non-toxicity. The Auxetic (rotating-square geometry)
   structure was made by laser cutting the polypropylene film. This flat
   structure was welded together to form a tubular form (stent), by an
   adjustable temperature control soldering iron station: following this,
   an annealing process was also carried out to ease any material stresses.
   Poisson's ratio was estimated and elastic and plastic deformation of the
   Auxetic structure was evaluated. The elastic and plastic deformation
   behaviours of the Auxetic polypropylene film were evaluated by applying
   repetitive uniaxial tensile loads. Observation of the structure showed
   that it was initially elastically deformed, thereafter plastic
   deformation occurred. This research discusses a novel way of fabricating
   an Auxetic structure (rotating-squares connected together through
   hinges) on Polypropylene films, by estimating the Poisson's ratio and
   evaluating the plastic deformation relevant to the expansion behaviour
   of an Auxetic stent within the oesophageal lumen.}},

Pages = {{423-432}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The buckling of compressively prestressed square membranes with built-in
   edges is investigated experimentally and analyzed theoretically. The
   buckling depends weakly on Poisson's ratio and essentially is a function
   of the reduced prestrain, <(epsilon)over bar>(0) = epsilon(0)a(2)/h(2)
   where epsilon(0) is the physical prestrain, a is the width, and h is the
   thickness of the membrane. As <(epsilon)over bar>(0) becomes
   increasingly negative, the membrane undergoes two symmetry breaking
   buckling transitions.' Beyond the first transition occurring at
   <(epsilon)over bar>(cr1), the buckling profile has all the reflection
   and rotation symmetries of a square. The reflection symmetries are lost
   through a second instability transition at <(epsilon)over bar>(cr3). The
   bifurcation points, <(epsilon)over bar>(cr1) and <(epsilon)over
   bar>(cr2). and-buckling profiles were calculated using analytical energy
   minimization and nonlinear finite-element simulation. Both
   methods:agree. The buckling of micromachined plasma-enhanced chemical
   vapor deposition silicon nitride membranes on a silicon wafer is
   interpreted in terms of the theoretical results. Good matching between
   measured and calculated buckling profiles is found. The extracted strain
   values are consistent irrespective of the size and buckling mode of the
   membranes. From the average strain across:the wafer epsilon(0) = -3.50 x
   10(-4) and complementary wafer curvature measurements, a Young's modulus
   of 130 GPa is deduced. Methods for the straightforward extraction of
   epsilon(0) from experimental center deflections of buckled square
   membranes are described. {[}443].}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing reservoir reconstruction technology is crucial in
   the development of shale gas exploitation techniques. Large quantities
   of high-pressure fluids injected into shale reservoirs significantly
   alter compressional (P) and shear (S) wave velocities, rock mechanical
   parameters, and anisotropic characteristics. In this study,
   differentiated hydraulic fracturing petrophysical experiments were
   carried out on Longmaxi Formation shale under pseudo-triaxial stress
   loading conditions. The effects of stress loading methods, and
   water-rock physical and chemical reactions on P- and S-wave velocities
   and rock mechanical parameters were compared. The experimental results
   showed that isotropic stress loading may increase the P- and S-wave
   velocities and Young's modulus of dry shale kldnsample. Furthermore, it
   may lead to a weakening of the corresponding anisotropy. In contrast,
   differential stress loading was able to improve the anisotropy of
   Young's modulus and accelerate the decrease in the compressive strength
   of shale in the vertical bedding direction. The water-rock physical and
   chemical reactions prompted by hydraulic fracturing was found to
   ``soften{''} shale samples and reduce Young's modulus. The influence of
   this ``soften{''} effect on the compressional and shear wave velocities
   of shale was negligible, whilst there was a significant decrease in the
   anisotropy characteristics of Thomsen parameters, Young's modulus, and
   Poisson's ratio. The negative linear relationship between the Poisson's
   ratios of the shale samples was also observed to lose sensitivity to
   stress loading, as a result of the ``soften{''} effect of fracturing
   fluid on shale. The results of this study provide a reliable reference
   point and data support for future research on the mechanical properties
   of Longmaxi shale rocks.}},

Abstract = {{The negativity of material properties has opened up the possibility for
   the design of materials and structures that can perform in ways that are

   possess their merits in certain applications. This paper explores a
   class of triangular-based composite metamaterial microstructure, with
   pin joints, that exhibits positive and negative Poisson's ratio as a
   result of tensile and compressive loads respectively. By incorporating
   an additional set of rods, the modified microstructure behaves as a
   positive hygrothermal expansion material due to decrease in temperature
   and/or moisture concentration, but exhibits negative hygrothermal
   expansivity upon the increase of temperature and/or moisture
   concentration. The possibility of producing materials with behavioral
   multiplicity offers opportunities for development of materials and
   structures that reverse their behavior depending on the switch in stress
   sign as well as a switch in the sign for change(s) to the environmental
   temperature and/or moisture concentration.}},

   triggers the cubic to tetragonal distortion. The calculated phonon

   are dynamically stable, and the PM-L1(0) -> AFM-L1(0) transition is
   caused by magnetism rather than lattice dynamics. Debye temperatures,
   anisotropy and Poisson's ratios are also first evaluated. The calculated

Abstract = {{The zero-inflated negative binomial regression model (ZINB) is often
   employed in diverse fields such as dentistry, health care utilization,
   highway safety, and medicine to examine relationships between exposures
   of interest and overdispersed count outcomes exhibiting many zeros. The
   regression coefficients of ZINB have latent class interpretations for a
   susceptible subpopulation at risk for the disease/condition under study
   with counts generated from a negative binomial distribution and for a
   non-susceptible subpopulation that provides only zero counts. The ZINB
   parameters, however, are not well-suited for estimating overall exposure
   effects, specifically, in quantifying the effect of an explanatory
   variable in the overall mixture population. In this paper, a
   marginalized zero-inflated negative binomial regression (MZINB) model
   for independent responses is proposed to model the population marginal
   mean count directly, providing straightforward inference for overall
   exposure effects based on maximum likelihood estimation. Through
   simulation studies, the finite sample performance of MZINB is compared
   with marginalized zero-inflated Poisson, Poisson, and negative binomial
   regression. The MZINB model is applied in the evaluation of a
   school-based fluoride mouthrinse program on dental caries in 677
   children. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Effect of microalloying on the toughness of metallic glasses}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{The effect of microalloying on the toughness of Cu-Ti-based metallic
   glasses is explored. Minor additions of Si and Sn in glass former
   Cu47Ti34Zr11Ni8 known to improve glass-forming ability are found here to
   sharply decrease toughness. The drop in toughness is associated with a
   small but meaningful increase in shear modulus, glass-transition
   temperature, yield strength, and a decrease in Poisson's ratio, implying
   a negative correlation between toughness and shear flow barrier. The
   strong influence of minor additions on the glass properties could be a
   useful tool for simultaneously tuning both the glass-forming ability and
   toughness of metallic glasses. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We describe mechanical metamaterials created by folding flat sheets in
   the tradition of origami, the art of paper folding, and study them in
   terms of their basic geometric and stiffness properties, as well as load
   bearing capability. A periodic Miura-ori pattern and a non-periodic Ron
   Resch pattern were studied. Unexceptional coexistence of positive and
   negative Poisson's ratio was reported for Miura-ori pattern, which are
   consistent with the interesting shear behavior and infinity bulk modulus
   of the same pattern. Unusually strong load bearing capability of the Ron
   Resch pattern was found and attributed to the unique way of folding.
   This work paves the way to the study of intriguing properties of origami
   structures as mechanical metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Timoshenko beam model is widely exploited in the literature to examine
   the mechanical behavior of stubby beamlike components. Timoshenko beam
   theory is well-known to require the shear correction factor in order to
   recognize the non-uniform shear distribution at a section. While a
   variety of shear correction factors are appeared in the literature so
   far, there is still no consensus on the most appropriate form of the
   shear correction factor. The Saint-Venant's flexure problem is first
   revisited in the frame work of the classical theory of elasticity and a
   highly accurate approximate closed-form solution is presented employing
   the extended Kantorovich method. The resulted approximate solution for
   the elasticity field is then employed to introduce two shear correction
   factors consistent with the Cowper's and energy approaches. The
   mathematical form of the proposed shear correction factors are then
   simplified and compared with the results available in the literature
   over an extended range of Poisson's and aspect ratios. The proposed
   shear correction factors do not exhibit implausible issue of negative
   values and do not result in numerical instabilities too. Based on the
   comprehensive discussion on the shear correction factors, a piecewise
   definition of shear correction factor is introduced for rectangular
   cross-sections having excellent agreement with the numerical results in
   the literature for both shallow and deep cross-sections.}},

Title = {{3D auxetic lattice materials for anomalous elastic wave polarization}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 26}},
Abstract = {{Elastic bulk materials support longitudinal and transverse waves such
   that the former travels faster in most cases. Anomalous polarization is
   the case when a transverse wave travels faster, allowing us to engineer
   the wave propagation via wave steering, scattering control, and mode
   conversion, which has critical applications in vibration mitigation and
   ultrasonic imaging. However, realizable materials that exhibit anomalous
   polarization are rarely found in nature, and architected materials that
   exhibit this property have only been demonstrated in 2D. In this
   article, we present 3D auxetic periodic lattice materials that support
   anomalous wave polarization. Through finite element analysis, we show
   that these lattices can switch between normal and anomalous behavior via
   simple geometry changes. We confirm the elasticity condition and
   qualitatively discuss the guidelines to design lattice materials that
   support anomalous polarization along a specific wave propagation
   direction. We show the ability to control the anomalous wave propagation
   direction by modifying the lattice geometry. Further, we numerically
   demonstrate mode conservation, deceleration, and acceleration of an
   incident wave using a material that exhibits anomalous wave
   polarization. These demonstrations show the potential application of
   such materials in nondestructive evaluation and medical imaging.

Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{An auxetic behaviour is evidenced in CoFe2O4 thin films grown by pulsed
   laser deposition on (100) MgO substrates under various O-2/N-2
   pressures. This rare behaviour for an intrinsic material is observed for
   intermediate oxidation conditions, in between two non auxetic domains
   delimited by high (>0.05 mbar) and low (<0.03 mbar) O-2/N-2 deposition
   pressures. Combining X-ray resonant diffraction and Mossbauer
   spectroscopy, we experimentally prove that the auxetic behaviour is
   related to the presence of cobalt ions in the tetrahedral sites. The
   impact of the structural modifications caused by the various oxidation
   conditions on the electronic and magnetic properties are studied for the
   various oxidation domains. Variations as important as a transition from
   a p-type semiconducting to an insulating behaviour, or from an in-plane
   to an out-of-plane magnetization are observed when spanning from the
   lowest (0.01 mbar) to the highest (1 mbar) studied oxidation pressures.

Abstract = {{A mechanism of instability of geomaterials in compression is proposed
   based on the phenomenon of transitional negative stiffness associated
   with the process of crack/fracture formation. This phenomenon acts only
   for a very short time as the fracture is being formed. The negative
   stiffness cracks increase the Poisson's ratio and thus are capable of
   making nearly incompressible material elastically unstable. A
   geomaterial can reach the limiting value of the incremental Poisson's
   ratio due to dilatancy observed in compression. While dilatancy is a
   non-linear phenomenon, incrementally, at the time of fracture formation
   it is elastic and hence can be made unstable by the transitional
   negative stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{The unique nonlinear mechanical properties including auxeticity of a
   class of orthotropic polyhedral structures are presented. These
   structures result from a three-dimensional coordinate rotation of the
   components. We establish an over-constrained periodic framework composed
   of edge-shared tetrahedra pivotally connected with each other. In the
   initial configuration, the unit cell is a stellated octahedron and has
   two conformational mechanisms both subject to uniform transformations.
   Modeling the tetrahedral unit with linear spring interactions, the
   effective on-axis Poisson's ratios and stress-strain curves are
   analyzed. In the restricted unimode model with a single degree of
   freedom under a uniaxial tension, the out-of-plane Poisson's ratio is a
   negative constant determined only by the initial height ratio, whereas
   the in-plane Poisson's ratio begins with -1 and slightly increases with
   increasing tension. The bimode model with additional geometric
   parameters exhibits a rich range of elastic behaviors, e.g., for any
   internal stiffness, an identical point exists through which pass the
   equilibrium trajectories. The bimode model also displays similar auxetic
   characteristics to the unimode model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Moran eigenvector spatial filtering (MESF) is a novel methodology in the
   spatially varying coefficients tradition promoted in spatial statistics,
   quantitative geography, and statistical ecology that deals with spatial
   autocorrelation in georeferenced data. Its Moran Coefficient based
   estimators exhibit statistical properties of unbiasedness, efficiency,
   and consistency. Evidence is accumulating that it also exhibits
   robustness, or good performance with georeferenced data drawn from not
   only normal, but also at least Poisson and binomial, probability
   distributions. This paper further explores this performance. In doing
   so, it addresses the sensitivity of MESF results to changing: (1) the
   employed spatial weights matrix specification for constructing MESF
   synthetic variates, in space, space-time, and spatial flows network
   structures; (2) the design of Monte Carlo simulation experiments; (3)
   cross-validation type imputation estimators; (4) the nature of embedded
   geographical dependence to include negative spatial autocorrelation (SA)
   components; and, (5) the SA index (e.g., the Geary Ratio) basis of
   eigenvector spatial filter (ESF) estimators. Empirical illustrations
   involve 2010 county resolution population density across the state of

Abstract = {{Background: Auxetic materials tend to exhibit stretching in the
   direction of the applied load as well as in the perpendicular direction.
   This may be an inherent property of the material, or it might be a
   particular structural characteristic that confers it with auxetic
   properties. In this study, the auxetic properties of a rotating squares
   auxetic design were utilized in tandem with a stretching mechanism to
   manufacture a device that offers the advantages of adjustable pore size
   and hence tunable drug delivery characteristics.
   Methods: An auxetic polyurethane film was fabricated through the polymer
   casting technique. An acrylonitrilebutadiene- styrene (ABS) plastic mold
   for polymer casting was made through additive manufacturing.
   Stereolithography was used for fabrication of the mechanism that
   controlled pore size of the polymeric auxetic film. A laminate
   arrangement of the film and the mechanism was devised, through which
   movement of the mechanism controlled stretching of the auxetic film
   underneath.
   Results: Results were analyzed through image processing. It was observed
   that a 2-dimensional increase (in length and width) of the auxetic film
   took place that corresponded to an increase in pore size of the film.
   Several mathematical correlations were drawn up.
   Conclusions: It may be concluded that the first factor controlling drug
   release kinetics is the pore size of the film. This study explored a
   prototype mechanism that has the potential for being used in devices for
   controlled drug delivery or in smart bandage systems that may enhance
   wound healing in chronic wound treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Freight transportation is an important factor in Turkish economic
   growth, and the high volume of truck traffic has increased traffic
   accidents on Turkish roads. However, to the best of our knowledge, no
   studies have investigated the factors that contribute to truck
   accidents. This study aims to reduce truck accident involvement and
   quantify the effect of variables on the occurrence of truck accidents on
   divided multilane interurban roads in Turkey. This study documents the
   performance of Poisson, Negative Binomial (NB), and Zero-inflated
   Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB) models to establish the relation
   between truck accidents and traffic and geometric road characteristics
   on a 282 km section of the Ankara-Aksaray-Eregli divided multilane
   interurban road. Model coefficients were estimated by the maximum
   likelihood method, and deviance and the Akaike information criterion
   were considered as goodness of fit statistics. The Vuong test was used
   to determine the appropriateness of using the ZINB model rather than the
   NB model. The results show that the NB model fitted the data very well.
   The proposed model for Turkish divided multilane interurban roads with a
   high percentage of truck traffic might be useful to detect critical
   factors and reduce truck accident involvement.}},

Abstract = {{The Al-Cu-TM (TM transition metal) alloy system has attracted great
   attention for both excellent glass-forming ability and its interesting
   physical properties. In this work, an investigation into the crystal,
   electrical and elastic properties of the AlCu2TM (TM = Ti, Zr, and Hf)
   compounds has been conducted by first-principles calculations based on
   density-functional theory. The fully relaxed structure parameters of the
   AlCu2TM compounds are in good agreement with previous experimental and
   other theoretical results. Besides, the cohesive energies of all the
   AlCu2TM compounds have been evaluated. The energy band and densities of
   state of these compounds are also obtained. According to the calculated
   single crystal elastic constants, all the compounds are mechanically
   stable. The polycrystalline bulk moduli, shear moduli, Young's moduli
   and Poisson's ratio have been deduced by using Voigt-Reuss-Hill (VRH)
   approximations. The calculated negative Cauchy pressure and ratio of
   bulk modulus to shear modulus indicated that the AlCu2TM compounds are
   ductile materials. The Debye temperatures of the AlCu2TM compounds
   decrease with increasing the TM (Ti, Zr, and Hf) atomic number. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Objective: mental health problems during adolescence lead to increased
   morbidity and mortality. We intend to test the hypothesis that bullying
   and addictive substance use is related to negative mood states.
   Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study among high school
   students in Burela (Northern Spain) (n=238). ``Negative mood state{''}
   was defined as experiencing the following: feeling tired, sad, out of
   place, bored, hopeless, nervous or lacking sleep. Independent variables
   were binge drinking, having smoked tobacco or cannabis, and the
   corresponding perceived risk of using them. The variable bullying was
   also measured. Poisson regression models with robust variance were
   estimated, and Prevalence Ratios were obtained.
   Results: 10.5\% {[}CI 95\% (7.2-15.2)] of the students reported
   suffering negative mood states. Students declaring low perceived risk of
   cannabis use {[}PR = 2.6 (1.2-5.5)], having tried this addictive
   substance at some point {[}PR = 3.1 (1.1-8.9)] and having suffered
   bullying {[}PR = 4.8 (2.4-9.6)] increased the risk of experiencing
   negative mood states.
   Conclusion: It would be advisable to design and implement interventions
   aimed at improving mental health during adolescence which account for
   the use of addictive substances and being a victim of bullying.}},

Title = {{A fourth order PDE based fuzzy c-means approach for segmentation of
   microscopic biopsy images in presence of Poisson noise for cancer
   detection}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Background and objective: For cancer detection from microscopic biopsy
   images, image segmentation step used for segmentation of cells and
   nuclei play an important role. Accuracy of segmentation approach
   dominate the final results. Also the microscopic biopsy images have
   intrinsic Poisson noise and if it is present in the image the
   segmentation results may not be accurate. The objective is to propose an
   efficient fuzzy c-means based segmentation approach which can also
   handle the noise present in the image during the segmentation process
   itself i. e. noise removal and segmentation is combined in one step.
   Methods: To address the above issues, in this paper a fourth order
   partial differential equation (FPDE) based nonlinear filter adapted to
   Poisson noise with fuzzy c-means segmentation method is proposed. This
   approach is capable of effectively handling the segmentation problem of
   blocky artifacts while achieving good tradeoffbetween Poisson noise
   removals and edge preservation of the microscopic biopsy images during
   segmentation process for cancer detection from cells.
   Results: The proposed approach is tested on breast cancer microscopic
   biopsy data set with region of interest (ROI) segmented ground truth
   images. The microscopic biopsy data set contains 31 benign and 27
   malignant images of size 896 x768. The region of interest selected
   ground truth of all 58 images are also available for this data set.
   Finally, the result obtained from proposed approach is compared with the
   results of popular segmentation algorithms; fuzzy c-means, color
   k-means, texture based segmentation, and total variation fuzzy c-means
   approaches.
   Conclusions: The experimental results shows that proposed approach is
   providing better results in terms of various performance measures such
   as Jaccard coefficient, dice index, Tanimoto coefficient, area under
   curve, accuracy, true positive rate, true negative rate, false positive
   rate, false negative rate, random index, global consistency error, and
   variance of information as compared to other segmentation approaches
   used for cancer detection. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   the derivative of this function with respect to a is the product of
   three things: a function of k, a function of a and the function a to the
   power k. We show that this assumption implies that the exponential
   family is either a binomial, or the Poisson, or a negative binomial
   family. Next, we study an analogous property for continuous
   distributions and we find that it is satisfied if and only the families
   are either Gaussian or Gamma. Ultimately, the proofs rely on the fact
   that only Mobius functions preserve the cross ratio.}},

Title = {{An experimental and numerical study on the transverse deformations in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{120-126}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{The transverse deformations of tendons assessed in tensile tests seems
   to constitute a controversial issue in literature. On the one hand,
   large positive variations of the Poisson's ratio have been reported,
   indicating volume reduction under tensile states. On the other hand,
   negative values were also observed, pointing out an auxetic material
   response. Based on these experimental observations, the following
   question is raised: Are these large and discrepant transverse
   deformations intrinsically related to the constitutive response of
   tendons or they result from artifacts of the mechanical test setup? In
   order to provide further insights to this question, an experimental and
   numerical study on the transverse kinematics of tendons was carried out.
   Tensile experiments were performed in branches of deep digital flexor
   tendons of domestic porcine, where the transverse displacements were
   measured by two high-speed, high accuracy optical digital micrometers
   placed transversely to one another. Aiming at a better understanding of
   the effects of the mechanical test setup in the transverse measurements,
   a three-dimensional finite element model is proposed to resemble the
   tensile experiment. The main achieved results strongly support the
   following hypotheses regarding tensile tests of tendons: the clamping
   region considerably affects the kinematics of the specimen even at a
   large distance from the clamps; the transverse deformations are mainly
   ruled by stiff fibers embedded in a soft matrix; the generalization of
   the Poisson's ratio to draw conclusions about changes in volume of
   tendons may lead to misinterpretations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Recently, engineers and researchers reconsider honeycomb sandwich
   structures due to their vast application in industries and aviation

   and tested. The purpose of the present work is to investigate
   numerically and experimentally with a comparative study on the effects
   of heat transfer on design parameters and geometry for different types
   of exotic honeycomb structures taking in account radiation within the
   cell and conduction in the cell walls. The numerical solution for
   temperature profiles for different types of exotic honeycomb structures
   and solid disk are performed in order to inspect the variation of heat
   transfer. The modeling results show a good agreement with the
   experimental results. The present work demonstrates that the temperature
   profile for reentrant is the highest one compared to splined and
   stiffened which reaches around 10\% at temperature of the front surface
   T-in = 100 degrees C. It was found that the rib length enhances
   significantly heat transfer. Results showed also that stiffened
   honeycomb has a good insulation and metallic honeycomb core structure
   has a good thermal insulation characteristic for the highest
   instantaneous temperature, whereas reentrant honeycomb has a good heat

Abstract = {{Background Early detection of outbreaks of transmissible diseases is
   essential for public health. This study aimed to determine the
   performance of the wavelet-based outbreak detection method (WOD) in
   detecting outbreaks and to compare its performance with the Poisson
   regression-based model and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA)
   using data of simulated pertussis outbreaks in Iran. Method The data on
   suspected cases of pertussis from 25th February 2012 to 23rd March 2018
   in Iran was used. The performance of the WOD (Daubechies 10 {[}db10] and
   Haar wavelets), Poisson regression-based method, and EWMA Compared in
   terms of timeliness and detection of outbreak days using the simulation
   of different outbreaks. In the current study, two simulations were used,
   one based on retrospectively collected data (literature-based) on
   pertussis cases and another one on a synthetic dataset created by the
   researchers. The sensitivity, specificity, false alarm, and
   false-negative rate, positive and negative likelihood ratios, under
   receiver operating characteristics areas, and median timeliness were
   used to assess the performance of the methods. Results In a
   literature-based outbreak simulation, the highest and lowest
   sensitivity, false negative in the detection of injected outbreaks were
   seen in db10, with sensitivity 0.59 (0.56-0.62), and Haar wavelets with
   0.57 (0.54-0.60). In the researcher simulated data, the EWMA (K = 0.5)
   with sensitivity 0.92 (0.90-0.94) had the best performance. About
   timeliness, the WOD methods showed the best performance in the early
   warning of the outbreak in both simulation approaches. Conclusion
   Performance of the WOD in the early alarming outbreaks was appropriate.
   However, this method would be best used along with other methods of
   public health surveillance.}},

   guest molecules are revealed via combining the high-pressure synchrotron
   X-ray diffraction experiments with density functional theory (DFT)

   In addition, full elastic constants of the perovskite were calculated to
   describe Young's moduli, shear moduli and Poisson's ratios. Notably,
   these discrete moduli are governed by the orientational guest molecule

   models to include random effects that account for correlation among
   observations. However, these models have been shown to have a few
   drawbacks, including interpretability of regression coefficients and
   numerical instability of fitting algorithms even when the data arise
   from the assumed model. To address these issues, we propose a model that
   parameterizes the marginal associations between the count outcome and
   the covariates as easily interpretable log relative rates, while
   including random effects to account for correlation among observations.
   One of the main advantages of this marginal model is that it allows a
   basis upon which we can directly compare the performance of standard
   methods that ignore zero inflation with that of a method that explicitly
   takes zero inflation into account. We present simulations of these
   various model formulations in terms of bias and variance estimation.
   Finally, we apply the proposed approach to analyze toxicological data of
   the effect of emissions on cardiac arrhythmias.}},

Abstract = {{The structural and elastic properties of BiMnO3 with monoclinic (C2/c)
   and orthorhombic (Pnma) ferromagnetic (FM) structures have been studied
   by first-principles calculations within LDA + U and GGA + U approaches.
   The equilibrium volumes and bulk moduli of BiMnO3 phases are evaluated
   by equation of state (EOS) fittings, and the bulk properties predicted
   by LDA + U calculations are in better agreement with experiment. The
   orthorhombic phase is found to be more stable than the monoclinic phase
   at ambient pressure. A monoclinic to monoclinic phase transition is
   predicted to occur at a pressure of about 10 GPa, which is ascribed to
   magnetism versus volume instability of monoclinic BiMnO3. The
   single-crystal elastic stiffness constants c(ij)s of the monoclinic and
   orthorhombic phases are investigated using the stress-strain method. The
   c(46) of the monoclinic phase is predicted to be negative. In addition,
   the polycrystalline elastic properties including bulk modulus, shear
   modulus, Young's modulus, bulk modulus-shear modulus ratio, Poisson's
   ratio, and elastic anisotropy ratio are determined based on the
   calculated elastic constants. The presently predicted phase transition
   and elastic properties open new directions for investigation of the
   phase transitions in BiMnO3, and provide helpful guidance for the future

Abstract = {{Poisson and negative binomial (NB) models have been used to analyze
   traffic accident occurrence at intersections for several years. There
   are however, limitations in the use of such models. The Poisson model
   requires the variance-to-mean ratio of the accident data to be about 1.
   Both the Poisson and the NB models require the accident data to be
   uncorrelated in time. Due to unobserved heterogeneity and serial
   correlation in the accident data, both models seem to be inappropriate.
   A more suitable alternative is the random effect negative binomial
   (RENB) model, which by treating the data in a time-series cross-section
   panel, will be able to deal with the spatial and temporal effects in the
   data.
   This paper describes the use of RENB model to identify the elements that
   affect intersection safety. To establish the suitability of the model,
   several goodness-of-fit statistics are used. The model is then applied
   to investigate the relationship between accident occurrence and the
   geometric, traffic and control characteristics of signalized
   intersections in Singapore. The results showed that 11 variables
   significantly affected the safety at the intersections. The total
   approach volumes, the numbers of phases per cycle, the uncontrolled
   left-turn lane and the presence of a surveillance camera are among the
   variables that are the highly significant. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Phase stability and elastic properties of Cr-V alloys}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},

Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{V is the only element in the periodic table that forms a complete solid
   solution with Cr and thus is particularly important in alloying strategy
   to ductilize Cr. This study combines first-principles density functional
   theory calculations and experiments to investigate the phase stability
   and elastic properties of Cr-V binary alloys. The cluster expansion
   study reveals the formation of various ordered compounds at low
   temperatures that were not previously known. These compounds become
   unstable due to the configurational entropy of bcc solid solution as the
   temperature is increased. The elastic constants of ordered and
   disordered compounds are calculated at both T = 0 K and finite
   temperatures. The overall trends in elastic properties are in agreement
   with measurements using the resonant ultrasound spectroscopy method. The
   calculations predict that addition of V to Cr decreases both the bulk
   modulus and the shear modulus, and enhances the Poisson's ratio, in
   agreement with experiments. Decrease in the bulk modulus is correlated
   to decrease in the valence electron density and increase in the lattice
   constant. An enhanced Poisson's ratio for bcc Cr-V alloys (compared to
   pure Cr) is associated with an increased density of states at the Fermi
   level. Furthermore, the difference charge density in the bonding region
   in the (110) slip plane is highest for pure Cr and decreases gradually
   as V is added. The present calculation also predicts a negative Cauchy
   pressure for pure Cr, and it becomes positive upon alloying with V. The
   intrinsic ductilizing effect from V may contribute, at least partially,
   to the experimentally observed ductilizing phenomenon in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{High-performance stretchable triboelectric nanogenerators (STENGs) based
   on hierarchical auxetic films consisting of polyurethane (PU) foam and
   Ag electrode layers were fabricated. The high conformability and
   stretchability of the STENGs enable the dual-mode operation in both
   contact-separation and stretching-releasing modes. Compared with STENG
   devices with a single operation mode, our dual-mode STENG exhibits a
   high output voltage of 320 V and a current of 45 mu A with an
   instantaneous output power density of 3 mW. The working principles of
   dual-mode STENG and the relationships between its output performance and
   the various types of mechanical motions were systematically studied,
   providing a working mode of STENGs for various practical applications.
   The high output power generation from dual-mode STENG can be used to
   operate light-emitting diodes and charge a wearable electronic device.
   The proposed energy harvester offers a promising way to provide power
   sources for micropower systems, stretchable electronics, and
   self-powered biomechanical sensors.}},

Abstract = {{We considered the negative group velocity of plate-mode waves. Lamb
   waves are a typical example of existence of negative group velocity.
   However, if we try to apply the negative group velocity of Lamb waves to
   some applications such as acoustical flat lenses, there is a problem
   about the existence of negative group velocity of Lamb waves. Its
   existence depends only on Poisson's ratio. That is, the negative group
   velocities of Lamb waves depend only physical parameters of materials.
   Consequently, we considered to control a negative group velocity. The
   negative group velocity of Lamb-type waves in a solid/liquid/solid
   structure can be controlled by changing the thickness of a liquid layer.
   In this research, we considered the relationships between the existence
   of negative group velocities and the parameters of each layer material
   with respect to Lamb-type waves in a solid/liquid/solid structure by
   numerical calculation. As a result, it was confirmed that the negative
   group velocity of Lamb-type waves depended not only on Poisson's ratio
   but also on the density of each layer and the longitudinal wave velocity
   of the liquid layer. This result is useful when the negative group
   velocity of Lamb-type waves is applied to acoustical flat lenses, which
   require the negative group velocity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the technique for the analysis of weak shock wave
   influence on the dynamic stress state of foam materials with negative
   and positive Poisson's ratio. The investigation of the dynamic behavior
   of foam materials under the action of weak shock waves is performed in
   the framework of couple stress elasticity, where one can account for the
   influence of shear rotation deformation in structurally inhomogeneous
   media. For the solution of the non-stationary problem, Fourier
   transforms are used. The calculation of transforms of dynamic stresses
   in the foam medium is performed by using the boundary integral equation
   method and the theory of complex variable functions in the framework of
   couple stress elasticity. The numerical implementation of the developed
   algorithm is based on the method of mechanical quadrature and
   collocation technique. For calculation of originals of dynamic stresses
   discrete, Fourier transform is used. The distribution of dynamic hoop
   stresses in a positive and negative Poisson's ratio foam medium with
   tunnel cavities under the action of a weak shock wave is investigated.
   The algorithm is effective in the analysis of the dynamic behavior of
   the foam media with tunnel defects of various cross-sections.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the analysis of the mechanical response of realistic
   fullerene-nanotube nanotruss networks with face-centered cubic geometry
   is performed by using molecular dynamics with reactive potentials. In
   particular, the mechanical properties of these novel architectures are
   investigated in both compressive and tensile regimes, a number of truss
   geometries by straining along different directions. Our atomistic
   simulations reveal a similar behavior under tensile stress for all the
   samples. Conversely, under compressive regimes the emergence of a
   response that depends on the orientation of load is observed together
   with a peculiar local instability. Due to this instability, some of
   these nanotruss networks present a negative Poisson ratio in
   compression, like re-entrant foams. Finally, the performance of these
   nanotruss networks is analyzed with regards to their use as impact
   energy absorbers, displaying properties that outperform materials
   traditionally used in these applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Free vibration and sound insulation of functionally graded honeycomb
   sandwich plates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{Based on the hyperbolic tangent shear deformation theory, free vibration
   and sound insulation of two different types of functionally graded (FG)
   honeycomb sandwich plates with negative Poisson's ratio are studied in
   this paper. Using Hamilton's principle, the vibration and vibro-acoustic
   coupling dynamic equations for FG honeycomb sandwich plates with simply
   supported edges are established. By applying the Navier's method and
   fluid-solid interface conditions, the derived governing dynamic
   equations are solved. The natural frequencies and the sound insulation
   of FG honeycomb sandwich plates obtained in this work are compared with
   the numerical results by the finite element simulation. It is proven
   that the theoretical models for the free vibration and the sound
   insulation are accurate and efficient. Moreover, FG sandwich plates with
   different honeycomb cores are investigated and compared. The
   corresponding results show that the FG honeycomb core with negative
   Poisson's ratio can yield much lower frequencies. Then, the influences
   of various geometrical and material parameters on the vibration and
   sound insulation performance are systematically analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a semi-nonparametric Poisson regression model to
   analyze motor vehicle crash frequency data collected from rural
   multilane highway segments in California, US. Motor vehicle crash
   frequency on rural highway is a topic of interest in the area of
   transportation safety due to higher driving speeds and the resultant
   severity level. Unlike the traditional Negative Binomial (NB) model, the
   semi-nonparametric Poisson regression model can accommodate an
   unobserved heterogeneity following a highly flexible semi-nonparametric
   (SNP) distribution. Simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate
   that the SNP distribution can well mimic a large family of
   distributions, including normal distributions, log-gamma distributions,
   bimodal and trimodal distributions. Empirical estimation results show
   that such flexibility offered by the SNP distribution can greatly
   improve model precision and the overall goodness-of-fit. The
   semi-nonparametric distribution can provide a better understanding of
   crash data structure through its ability to capture potential
   multimodality in the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. When
   estimated coefficients in empirical models are compared, SNP and NB
   models are found to have a substantially different coefficient for the
   dummy variable indicating the lane width. The SNP model with better
   statistical performance suggests that the NB model overestimates the
   effect of lane width on crash frequency reduction by 83.1\%.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive characterization of the novel class of anti-tetrachiral
   cellular solids, both considering the static and the dynamic response,
   is provided in the paper.
   The heterogeneous material is characterized by a periodic microstructure
   made of equi-spaced rings each interconnected by four ligaments. In the
   most general case, rings and ligaments are surrounded by a softer matrix
   and the rings can be filled by a different material.
   First, the first order linear elastic homogenized constitutive response
   is estimated resorting to two different microstructural models: a
   discrete model, in which the ligaments are modeled as beams and the
   presence of the matrix is neglected and the equivalent elastic
   properties are evaluated through a simplified analytical approach, and a
   more detailed continuous model, where the actual properties of matrix,
   ligaments and rings, varying in the 2D domain, are considered and the
   first order computational homogenization is adopted. Special attention
   is given to the dependence of the 2D overall Cauchy-type elastic
   constants on the mechanical and geometrical parameters characterizing
   the microstructure. The results, indeed, show the existence of large
   variations in the linear elastic constants and degree of anisotropy. A
   comparison with available experimental results confirms the validity of
   the analytical and numerical approaches adopted.
   Finally, the rigorous Floquet-Bloch approach is applied to the periodic
   cell of the cellular solid to evaluate the dispersion of propagation
   waves along the orthotropic axes in the framework of elasticity and to
   detect band gaps characterizing the material. A numerical approach,
   based on the first order computational homogenization, is also adopted
   and the rigorous and approximate solutions are compared. (C) 2015

Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{30}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The design of advanced functional devices often requires the use of
   intrinsically curved geometries that belong to the realm of
   non-Euclidean geometry and remain a challenge for traditional
   engineering approaches. Here, it is shown how the simple deflection of
   thick meta-plates based on hexagonal cellular mesostructures can be used
   to achieve a wide range of intrinsic (i.e., Gaussian) curvatures,
   including dome-like and saddle-like shapes. Depending on the unit cell
   structure, non-auxetic (i.e., positive Poisson ratio) or auxetic (i.e.,
   negative Poisson ratio) plates can be obtained, leading to a negative or
   positive value of the Gaussian curvature upon bending, respectively. It
   is found that bending such meta-plates along their longitudinal
   direction induces a curvature along their transverse direction.
   Experimentally and numerically, it is shown how the amplitude of this
   induced curvature is related to the longitudinal bending and the
   geometry of the meta-plate. The approach proposed here constitutes a
   general route for the rational design of advanced functional devices
   with intrinsically curved geometries. To demonstrate the merits of this
   approach, a scaling relationship is presented, and its validity is
   demonstrated by applying it to 3D-printed microscale meta-plates.
   Several applications for adaptive optical devices with adjustable focal
   length and soft wearable robotics are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The development of new materials based on industrial wastes has been the
   focus of much research for a sustainable world. The growing demand for
   tyres has been every year exacerbating environmental problems due to
   indiscriminate disposal in the nature, making a potentially harmful
   waste to public health. The incorporation of rubber particles from scrap
   tyres into polymeric composites has achieved high toughness and moderate
   mechanical properties. This work investigates the geometric effects
   (thickness, width and internal cell angle) of auxetic structures made of
   recycled rubber composites based on experimental and numerical data. The
   response surface models integrated with the swarm intelligence and
   finite element analysis were proposed in order to obtain a range of
   solutions that provides useful information to the user during the
   selection of geometric parameters for reentrant cells. The results
   revealed the cell thickness ranges from 39-40 mm and 5.98-6 mm, and the
   cell angle range from -0.01 to -0.06 degrees maximize the ultimate
   strength. The same parameters were able to optimize the modulus of
   elasticity of rubber auxetic structures, excepting for the angle factor
   which must be set between -30 and 27.7 degrees. The optimal Poisson's
   ratio was found when the cell angle ranged from -30 to -28.5 degrees,
   cell width ranged from 5-5.6 mm and 2 mm in thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Soft network materials constructed with horseshoe microstructures
   represent a class of bio-inspired synthetic materials that can be
   tailored precisely to match the nonlinear, J-shaped, stress-strain
   curves of human skins. Under a large level of stretching, the nonlinear
   deformations associated with the drastic changes of microstructure
   geometries can lead to an evident mechanical anisotropy, even for
   honeycomb and triangular lattices with a sixfold rotational symmetry.
   Such anisotropic mechanical responses are essential for certain targeted
   applications of these synthetic materials. By introducing appropriate
   periodic boundary conditions that apply to large deformations, this work
   presents an efficient computational model of soft network materials
   based on the analyses of representative unit cells. This model is
   validated through comparison of predicted deformed configurations with
   full-scale finite element analyses (FEA) for different loading angles
   and loading strains. Based on this model, the anisotropic mechanical
   responses, including the nonlinear stress-strain curves and Poisson's
   ratios, are systematically analyzed for three representative lattice
   topologies (square, triangular and honeycomb). An analytic solution of
   the geometry-based critical strain was found to show a good
   correspondence to the critical transition point of the calculated
   J-shaped stress-strain curve for different network geometries and
   loading angles. Furthermore, the nonlinear Poisson's ratio, which can be
   either negative or positive, was shown to depend highly on both the
   loading angle and the loading strain.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   While additive manufacturing via melt-extrusion of plastics has been
   around for more than several decades, its application to complex
   geometries has been hampered by the discretization of parts into planar
   layers. This requires wasted support material and introduces anisotropic
   weaknesses due to poor layer-to-layer adhesion. Curved-layer
   manufacturing has been gaining attention recently, with increasing
   potential to fabricate complex, low-weight structures, such as
   mechanical metamaterials. This paper aims to study the fabrication and
   mechanical characterization of non-planar lattice structures under
   cyclic loading.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A mathematical approach to parametrize lattices onto Bezier surfaces is
   validated and applied here to fabricate non-planar lattice samples via
   curved-layer fused deposition modeling. The lattice chirality, amplitude
   and unit cell size were varied, and the properties of the samples under
   cyclic-loading were studied experimentally.
   Findings
   Overall, lattices with higher auxeticity showed less energy dissipation,
   attributed to their bending-deformation mechanism. Additionally,
   bistability was eliminated with increasing auxeticity, reinforcing the
   conclusion of bending-dominated behavior. The analysis presented here
   demonstrates that mechanical metamaterial lattices such as auxetics can
   be explored experimentally for complex geometries where traditional
   methods of comparing simple geometry to end-use designs are not
   applicable.
   Originality/value
   This work presents an experimental approach to study the mechanical
   properties of non-planar lattice structures via quasi-static cyclic
   loading, comparing variations across several lattice patterns including
   auxetic sinusoids, disrupted sinusoids and their equivalent-density
   quadratic patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular structures with hexagonal unit cells show a high degree of
   flexibility in design. Based on the geometry of the unit cells, highly
   orthotropic structures, structures with negative Poisson's ratios,
   structures with high strain capability in a particular direction, or
   other desirable characteristics may be designed. Much of the prior work
   on cellular structures is based on hexagonal honeycomb-like unit cells,
   without any inclusions. The present paper envisages extending
   conventional cellular honeycomb-like structures to have inclusions or
   internal features within the unit cells. Various types of internal
   features such as contact elements, buckling beams,
   bi-stable/snap-through elements or viscous dashpots can result in unit
   cells which display stiffening, softening, negative stiffness, or
   dissipative behavior. A structure can be assembled using a specific
   element type, or different types of elements in specific arrangements,
   to provide desired system level behavior. The ability to so optimally
   and flexibly design cellular structures could potentially lead to their
   replacing conventional structures made from bulk materials.
   As a first step, this paper presents work on hexagonal unit cells with
   linear springs as the simplest of inclusions. The hexagonal cell itself
   is comprised of rigid links and pin-joints. Since such a cell has no
   stiffness of its own, the behavior of any internal feature is
   emphasized. However, for kinematic stability purposes, three springs are
   required, and the significance of these constraints within the cell will
   be discussed. For different spring arrangements, closed-form analytical
   expressions are derived for the in-plane modulus and Poisson's ratio.
   The analytical expressions are validated using NASTRAN finite element
   simulations, as well as against experimental tensile/compressive tests
   of fabricated unit cells with internal springs. When the spring
   stiffness exceeds certain values, the rigid cell wall assumption is no
   longer valid, and these bounds are established. The validated analysis
   is used to conduct design studies on how the cell modulus would vary
   with geometric parameters such as cell angle and cell wall length ratio.}},

Abstract = {{The coefficient of determination R-2 quantifies the proportion of
   variance explained by a statistical model and is an important summary
   statistic of biological interest. However, estimating R-2 for
   generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have
   previously introduced a version of R-2 that we called R-2 GLMM for
   Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families.
   Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation
   coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we
   generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in
   particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are
   commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our
   approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's
   inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding
   the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications
   for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta
   method allows a general derivation of variance associated with
   non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations
   for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the
   implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of
   ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be
   used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.}},

Abstract = {{Linear actuation is a basic need in robotized manipulation of surgical
   instruments, that must comply with a challenging environment in terms of
   safety, compactness and now often compatibility with imaging modalities
   like CT or MRI. In this paper, we focus on needle manipulation for
   interventional radiology. We propose a needle driver, i.e. a linear
   actuator for needle insertion, based on the inchworm principle combined
   with pneumatic energy. Our first contribution is to propose, model and
   implement the device using a so-called auxetic structure. Its use
   increases achievable displacement under pressure and provides sufficient
   off-axis stiffness to use the actuator without additional guidance.
   Simplified modeling is introduced for the actuator synthesis. Our second
   contribution is to implement the actuator with multimaterial additive
   manufacturing combining rigid and flexible materials to increase
   compactness. As a third contribution, initial assessment of component
   sterilization and compatibility with X-ray and MRI imaging modalities is
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an analytical solution to the axisymmetric
   elasticity problem for an inhomogeneous solid cylinder subjected to
   external force loadings, which vary within the axial coordinate. The
   material properties of the cylinder are assumed to be arbitrary
   functions of the radial coordinate. By making use of the direct
   integration method, the problem is reduced to coupled integral equations
   for the shearing stress and the total stress (given by the superposition
   of the normal ones). By making use of the resolventkernel solution, the
   latter equations were uncoupled and then solved in a closed analytical
   form. On this basis, the effect of variable material moduli in the
   stress distribution has been examined with special attention given to
   the negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a topology optimization method to design periodic
   unit cell in cellular materials with extreme properties using a moving
   iso-surface threshold method. The aim is to determine the optimal
   distribution of material within the periodic unit cell. The effective
   properties of cellular material are obtained by using a finite
   element-based homogenization method. The penalty function approach is
   introduced to construct the objective function for designing material
   with extreme properties under condition of square or isotropic symmetry.
   New characteristic response functions of moving iso-surface threshold
   are proposed for maximum shear or bulk modulus, maximum shear modulus or
   negative Poisson's ratio under isotropic symmetry. Several examples are
   presented and the results are compared to those obtained with the solid
   isotropic material with penalization method to demonstrate the validity
   of the method. A series of new and interesting microstructures with
   extreme properties are found and presented.}},

Abstract = {{Interest to crash response of vehicle parts is increasing closely
   related with their importance for safety of passengers. In low velocity
   crash case, integration of foams to tubular systems shows positive
   effect on the performance. While foams are classified stochastic micro
   lattice structures, recently, dynamic behaviour of lattices in macro
   size are being researched with 3D printing technique. In addition to
   conventional macro lattices showing positive Poisson's ratio have good
   energy absorbing capabilities, with only geometrical modification macro
   lattices with negative Poisson's ratio can be created and have better
   energy absorbing capability than conventional ones. In this study, in
   different dimensions, blocks of anti-tetrachiral metallic lattices
   exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio, are modelled. Crushing behaviour of
   them is investigated under low-velocity impact using explicit and
   implicit FEA tools. With the results of this study, suitable
   width-lenght ratio of macro level anisotropic anti-tetrachiral lattices
   will be able to classified. In addition to that, force-time behaviour in
   different impact velocities will be able to understood to use in not
   only tubular systems but also in sandwich structures as core part.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, various computational methods and tools are used
   to investigate the effect of the prior processing and the resulting
   microstructure on the performance of all-metal sandwich-structures with
   an auxetic-hexagonal core. Specific fabrication processes analyzed in
   the present work include: (a) sheet-metal fabrication using cold flat
   rolling; (b) a simple stamping process used to impart the desired
   corrugation to the as-cold rolled sheet-metal blanks; and (c) laser
   welding used to join the corrugated and stacked adjacent blanks over
   their areas of contact. The computational analyses employed yielded the
   results which clearly revealed how each of the three fabrication
   processes affects the grain microstructure of the sheet-metal blanks,
   the presence of residual stresses within the sandwich-structure as well
   as the presence of distortions. In the last portion of the present work,
   a series of transient nonlinear dynamics finite-element computational
   analyses is carried out in order to demonstrate how the prior
   fabrication processes and the material microstructure, residual stresses
   and distortions yielded by them affects the dynamic performance of the
   all-metal auxetic sandwich-structures subjected to blast loading. The
   results obtained clearly showed that the effect of prior processing must
   be taken into account in order to obtain accurate insight into the
   dynamic response of sandwich structures when subjected to blast loading.

Abstract = {{This work illustrates viscoelastic testing and fractional derivative
   modelling to describe the thermally induced transformation equivalent
   viscoelastic damping of NiTiCu SMA ribbons. NiTiCu SMA ribbons have been
   recently evaluated to manufacture novel honeycombs concepts
   (conventional and negative Poisson's ratio) in shape memory alloys for
   high damping and deployable sandwich antennas constructions. The dynamic
   mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) test has been carried out at
   different frequencies and temperatures, with increasing and decreasing
   temperature gradients. Thermally induced transformations (austenitic and
   martensitic) provide damping peaks at low frequency range excitations.
   On the opposite, the storage moduli are not affected by, the harmonic
   pulsation. As the SMA ribbon. increases its stiffness, the damping
   capacity reduces, and the loss factor drops dramatically at austenite
   finish temperature. The fractional derivative models provide a compact
   representation of the asymmetry of the peak locations, as well as the
   storage modulus change from martensite to austenite phases.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a sparse image reconstruction method for Poisson distributed
   polychromatic X-ray computed tomography (CT) measurements under the
   blind scenario where the material of the inspected object and the
   incident energy spectrum are unknown. We employ our mass-attenuation
   spectrum parameterization of the noiseless measurements for
   single-material objects and express the mass-attenuation spectrum as a
   linear combination of B-spline basis functions of order one. A block
   coordinate descent algorithm is developed for constrained minimization
   of a penalized Poisson negative log-likelihood (NLL) cost function,
   where constraints and penalty terms ensure nonnegativity of the spline
   coefficients and nonnegativity and sparsity of the density-map image;
   the image sparsity is imposed using a convex total-variation (TV) norm
   penalty term. This algorithm alternates between a Nesterov' s
   proximal-gradient (NPG) step for estimating the density-map image and a
   limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno with box constraints
   (LBFGS-B) step for estimating the incident-spectrum parameters. We
   establish conditions for biconvexity of the penalized NLL objective
   function, which, if satisfied, ensures monotonicity of the NPG-BFGS
   iteration. We also show that the penalized NLL objective satisfies the
   Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property, which is important for establishing local
   convergence of block-coordinate descent schemes in biconvex optimization
   problems. Simulation examples demonstrate the performance of the
   proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) crystalline materials possess unique structural,
   mechanical and electronic properties(1,2) that make them highly
   attractive in many applications(3-5). Although there have been advances
   in preparing 2D materials that consist of one or a few atomic or
   molecular layers(6,7), bottom-up assembly of 2D crystalline materials
   remains a challenge and an active area of development(8-10). More
   challenging is the design of dynamic 2D lattices that can undergo
   large-scale motions without loss of crystallinity. Dynamic behaviour in
   porous three-dimensional (3D) crystalline solids has been exploited for
   stimuli-responsive functions and adaptive behaviour(11-13). As in such
   3D materials, integrating flexibility and adaptiveness into crystalline
   2D lattices would greatly broaden the functional scope of 2D materials.
   Here we report the self-assembly of unsupported, 2D protein lattices
   with precise spatial arrangements and patterns using a readily
   accessible design strategy. Three single-or double-point mutants of the
   C4-symmetric protein RhuA were designed to assemble via different modes
   of intermolecular interactions (single-disulfide, double-disulfide and
   metal-coordination) into crystalline 2D arrays. Owing to the flexibility
   of the single-disulfide interactions, the lattices of one of the
   variants ((C98)RhuA) are essentially defect-free and undergo
   substantial, but fully correlated, changes in molecular arrangement,
   yielding coherently dynamic 2D molecular lattices. (C98)RhuA lattices
   display a Poisson's ratio of -1-the lowest thermodynamically possible
   value for an isotropic material-making them auxetic.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the static noise margin (SNM) of ultrathin-body
   (UTB) SOI SRAM 6T/8T cells operating in the subthreshold region using
   analytical solutions of Poisson's equation validated with TCAD
   simulations. An analytical framework to calculate the SNM for UTB SOI
   SRAMs operating in the subthreshold region is presented. Our results
   indicate that for improving both read SNM (RSNM) and write SNM (WSNM),
   the back-gating technique is more effective in the subthreshold region
   than in the superthreshold region. The 6T UTB SOI subthreshold SRAM cell
   with the back-gating technique by increasing the strength of the pull-up
   transistors and decreasing the strength of the pass-gate transistors
   shows comparable RSNM with the 10T bulk subthreshold SRAM and an
   improvement in RSNM variation. Due to better electrostatic integrity,
   the back-gating technique (pull-up transistors with positive back-gate
   bias, pull-down/pass-gate transistors with negative back-gate bias)
   mitigates the 6T UTB SOI SRAM RSNM variation significantly with some
   improvement in RSNM. Increasing cell beta-ratio shows a limited
   improvement on RSNM and has no benefit on the SNM variability for the
   subthreshold operation. The UTB SOI 8T SRAM cell exhibits RSNM 2 x
   larger than the 6T SRAM cell in the subthreshold region. Both negative
   bit-line voltage (VBL) and boosted word-line voltage (VWL) are more
   effective than lower cell supply voltage to improve WSNM, and negative
   VBL shows a larger improvement in WSNM than boosted VWL.}},

Title = {{Modulation of multi-directional auxeticity in hybrid origami
   metamaterials}},
Journal = {{APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A novel origami metamaterial with programmable multi-directional
   auxeticity is proposed by hybridizing the concept of re-entrant
   honeycomb with the Miura pattern. Normal Miura-based origami
   metamaterials have been widely shown to exhibit negative in-plane
   Poisson's ratio. However, negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio cannot
   be realized in these set of materials, essentially limiting their
   capability for prospective applications in many multi-functional devices
   and systems. Here we propose a hybrid Miura-based meta material that can
   show both in-plane and out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratios. More
   interestingly, we are able to program the Poisson's ratios to have mild
   to extreme auxeticity and map their mutual interaction as a function of
   the microstructural configuration. Besides the single-layer meta-sheets,
   we have shown that a class of multi-layer stacked metamaterial with
   uniform and graded configurations can be developed to achieve
   multi-objective functional goals. Theoretical and experimental analyses
   are combined in this paper to demonstrate the concepts of modulating
   multi-directional Poisson's ratios. The fundamental mechanics of the
   proposed origami based metamaterial being scale-independent, this novel
   class of deployable hybrid materials can be directly transferred for
   application in a range of milli-, micro, and nanometer-size systems,
   essentially opening avenues for the design of energy absorbers, sensors,
   actuators, medical stents, catalysis, drug delivery systems, adaptive
   wings for next-generation of aircrafts and other deployable mechanical
   and electronic systems at multiple length-scales. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

   respectively, were carried out, and tensile performances of the samples
   under biaxial tensile loads were analyzed. The test results show that
   the PVC membrane is highly nonlinear and orthotropic under biaxial
   tensile loads. With the increase of loading cycles, the total residual
   strain is nearly unchangeable and the hysteresis curve becomes stable.
   Slope of warp curve is larger than weft curves, and the weft loop area
   is greater than the warp one with the same load ratio. The generalized
   Poisson ratio changes due to variations of the load ratio (R). when R<1,
   the experimental values and theoretical values of the generalized
   poisson's ratio are negative. When R >= 1, generalized poisson's ratios
   tend to be constant, When the load ratio are 0:1 and 1:0, the curves

Title = {{Enhanced mechanical properties in cellular solids using axisymmetric
   configurations}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{255}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Cellular solids, as a class of materials, are known for a high strength
   to weight ratio. Their design into non-stochastic configurations is
   known to be beneficial for the tailor and control of their mechanical
   properties. The current developments on additive manufacturing allow a
   successful route to manufacture these scaffolds and gives a novel
   freedom in their design process. This study explores the deformation
   behavior of axisymmetric non-stochastic cellular solids, allowing the
   understanding of the mechanisms that enhance their mechanical properties
   relatively to regular extruded lattices. It is shown that axisymmetric
   samples display a circumferential deformation effect that distributed
   loads along the volume of the material. This effect, however, is more
   prominent in axisymmetric samples with auxetic behavior. The coupling of
   circumferential deformation and the dynamic density changes in auxetic
   samples generate an overall increase in modulus, collapse stress and
   energy absorption.}},

Abstract = {{Strain engineering can be served as an efficient tool for tuning
   physical properties of two-dimentional (2D) materials. However, the
   quantifying strain and characterizing its spatially inhomogeneous
   distribution are always challenging. Here, we report the strain-induced
   lattice vibration mode variations in monolayer black phosphorus (BP) and
   clarify the underlying mechanism resorting to the bond relaxation theory
   based on the combination of mass-spring model and Lagrangian dynamics.
   We reveal that the Ag2 and B-2g modes exhibit blue (red) shifts while
   the Ag1 mode shows a red (blue) shift through applying an armchair
   (zigzag) strain, which can be ascribed to the orientation-dependent
   lattice vibration mode variations resulting from the different responses
   of force constants. Moreover, it is found that a negative Poisson's
   ratio along the out-of-plane direction emerges when the strain is
   applied in the zigzag direction. Our results offer intriguing insights
   into the underlying physics of vibration mode variations in strained
   BP-like 2D layered materials.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic micromechanical framework for multiphase composites is
   proposed to characterize the probabilistic behaviors of effective
   properties of composite materials. Based on our previous work, the
   deterministic micromechanical model of the multiphase composites is
   derived by introducing the strain concentration tensors. By modeling the
   volume fractions and properties of constituents as stochastic, we extend
   the deterministic framework to stochastic to incorporate the inherent
   randomness of effective properties among different specimens. A new
   simulation framework, consisting of univariate approximation for
   multivariate function, Newton interpolations, and Monte Carlo
   simulation, is developed to quantitatively evaluate the stochastic
   characteristics of the effective properties of composites. Numerical
   examples including limited experimental validations, comparisons with
   existing micromechanical models, and the Monte Carlo simulations
   indicate that the proposed models provide an accurate and
   computationally efficient framework in characterizing the effective
   properties of multiphase composites. Finally, the effects of the
   correlation between the constituents' material parameters are discussed
   based on our proposed stochastic micromechanical model, which shows that
   the negative correlation between Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of
   the constituents can enhance the effective properties of the composites.}},

Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2008-2030}},
Abstract = {{The negative binomial (NB) model and the generalized Poisson (GP) model
   are common alternatives to Poisson models when overdispersion is present
   in the data. Having accounted for initial overdispersion, we may require
   further investigation as to whether there is evidence for zero-inflation
   in the data. Two score statistics are derived from the GP model for
   testing zero-inflation. These statistics, unlike Wald-type test
   statistics, do not require that we fit the more complex zero-inflated
   overdispersed models to evaluate zero-inflation. A simulation study
   illustrates that the developed score statistics reasonably follow a 2
   distribution and maintain the nominal level. Extensive simulation
   results also indicate the power behavior is different for including a
   continuous variable than a binary variable in the zero-inflation (ZI)
   part of the model. These differences are the basis from which
   suggestions are provided for real data analysis. Two practical examples
   are presented in this article. Results from these examples along with
   practical experience lead us to suggest performing the developed score
   test before fitting a zero-inflated NB model to the data.}},

Abstract = {{Westudied the mechanical response of a recently developed new class of
   mechanical metamaterials based on the paper art of cutting, kirigami.
   Specially, the geometrical and structural design of representative cut
   units, via combined line cut, cut-out, and hierarchy of the structure,
   was explored for achieving both extreme stretchability and/or
   compressibility in kirigami metamaterials through experiments, alongside
   geometrical modeling and finite element simulations. The kirigami design
   was tested on constituent materials including non-stretchable copy
   papers and highly stretchable silicone rubber to explore the role of
   constituent material properties. The cut unit in the shape of solid
   rectangles with the square shape as a special case was demonstrated for
   achieving the extreme stretchability via rigid rotation of cut units. We
   found that compared to the square cut units, the theoretically predicted
   maximum stretchability via unit rotation in rectangle units (aspect
   ratio 2:1) increased dramatically from about 41\% to 124\% for the level
   1 cut structure without hierarchy, and from about 62\% to 156\% for the
   level 2 hierarchical cut structure, which was validated by both
   experiments and simulations. To demonstrate the achievement of both
   extreme stretchability and compressibility, we replaced the solid square
   cut units with porous squares and re-entrant lattice shapes in silicone
   rubber based metamaterials. We found that a porous structure can enable
   an extreme compressibility of as high as 81\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   Poisson signals in the presence of background}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We construct uncertainty intervals for weak Poisson signals in the
   presence of background. We consider the case where a primary experiment
   yields a realization of the signal plus background, and a second
   experiment yields a realization of the background. The data acquisition
   times, for the background-only experiment, T-bg, and the primary
   experiment, T, are selected so that their ratio, T-bg/T, varies from 1
   to 25. The upper choice of 25 is motivated by an experimental study at
   the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The expected
   number of background counts in the primary experiment varies from 0.2 to
   2. We construct 90\% and 95\% confidence intervals based on a
   propagation-of-errors method as well as two implementations of a Neyman
   procedure where acceptance regions are constructed based on a
   likelihood-ratio criterion that automatically determines whether the
   resulting confidence interval is one-sided or two-sided. In one of the
   implementations of the Neyman procedure due to Feldman and Cousins (FC),
   uncertainty in the expected background contribution is neglected. In the
   other implementation, we account for random uncertainty in the estimated
   expected background with a parametric bootstrap implementation of a
   method due to Conrad. We also construct minimum length Bayesian
   credibility intervals. For each method, we test for the presence of a
   signal based on the value of the lower endpoint of the uncertainty
   interval. In general, the propagation-of-errors method performs the
   worst compared to the other methods according to frequentist coverage
   and detection probability criteria, and sometimes produces nonsensical
   intervals where both endpoints are negative. The Neyman procedures
   generally yield intervals with better frequentist coverage properties
   compared to the Bayesian method except for some cases where T-bg/T = 1.
   In general, the Bayesian method yields intervals with lower detection
   probabilities compared to Neyman procedures. One of the main conclusions
   is that when T-bg/T is 5 or more and the expected background is 2 or
   less, the FC method outperforms the other methods considered. For T-bg/T
   = 1, 2 we observe that the Neyman procedure methods yield false
   detection probabilities for the case of no signal that are higher than
   expected given the nominal frequentist coverage of the interval. In
   contrast, for T-bg/T = 1, 2, the false detection probability of the
   Bayesian method is less than expected according to the nominal
   frequentist coverage.}},

Abstract = {{Analytic expressions for strains in carbon nanotubes of all chiralities
   in lateral and axial directions have been obtained. These expressions
   have been related to bond angle and bond length flexibilities. This
   finally results in obtaining very generalized results for Poisson ratio
   of all chirality and P: all diameter carbon nanotubes. It turns out that
   the Poisson ratio is always independent of carbon nanotube diameter, but
   depends on their chirality. On the assumption of fixed bond lengths,
   (only flexible bond angle), the Poisson ratio of all chirality tubes is
   obtained to be 1. When realistic flexibility of bond lengths and bond
   angles is assumed, the Poisson ratio is between similar to 0 and 0.3,
   depending upon chirality. There is thus a compensation in lateral
   dimension when both, bond lengths and bond angles are assumed flexible,
   which has also been described as possibly a cause of very small or
   negative thermal expansion of single nanotubes. Further, it has been
   found that the Poisson ratio is sensitive to applied initial stress,
   varying significantly when obtained under different initial stress
   values. It is observed that Poisson ratio can be used to justify the
   interaction potential by finding out the bond length flexibility in
   comparison to bond angle flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{A state-of-the-art analysis of the pion-photon transition form factor is
   presented based on an improved theoretical calculation that includes the

   the existing experimental data using this method and by employing pion
   distribution amplitudes with up to three Gegenbauer coefficients a(2),
   a(4), a(6). Allowing for an error range in the coefficient a(6)
   approximate to 0, the theoretical predictions for gamma{*}gamma -> pi(0)
   obtained with nonlocal QCD sum rules are found to be in good agreement
   with all data that support a scaling behavior of the transition form
   factor at higher Q(2), like those of the Belle Collaboration. The data
   on gamma{*}gamma -> eta/eta' from CLEO and BABAR are also reproduced,
   while there is a strong conflict with the auxetic trend of the BABAR
   data above 10 GeV2. The broader implications of these findings are

   form of quartz referred to as alpha-quartz falls within this class and
   is known to possess such interesting elastic properties as negative

   elasto-electromagnetic metamaterials}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Synergistic integration of electromagnetic (EM) and mechanical
   properties of metamaterials, a concept known as smart metamaterials,
   promises new applications across the spectrum, from flexible waveguides
   to shape-conforming cloaks. These applications became possible thanks to
   smart transformation optics (STO), a design methodology that utilizes
   coordinate transformations to control both EM wave propagation and
   mechanical deformation of the device. Here, we demonstrate several STO
   devices based on extremely auxetic (Poisson ratio -1)
   elasto-electromagnetic metamaterials, both of which exhibit enormous
   flexibility and sustain efficient operation upon a wide range of
   deformations. Spatial maps of microwave electric fields across these
   devices confirm our ability to deform carpet cloaks, bent waveguides,
   and potentially other quasi-conformal TO-based devices operating at 7
   similar to 8 GHz. These devices are each fabricated from a single sheet
   of initially uniform (double-periodic) square-lattice metamaterial,
   which acquires the necessary distribution of effective permittivity
   entirely from the mechanical deformation of its boundary. By integrating
   transformation optics and continuum mechanics theory, we provide
   analytical derivations for the design of STO devices. Additionally, we
   clarify an important point relating to two-dimensional STO devices: the
   difference between plane stress and plane strain assumptions, which lead
   to elastic metamaterials with Poisson ratio -1 and -infinity,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The ridge estimator has been consistently demonstrated to be an

   The Poisson regression negative binomial regression models are
   well-known model in application when the response variable is count

   variance of maximum likelihood estimator of the count regression
   coefficients. To address this problem, a count data ridge estimator has
   been proposed by numerous researchers. In this paper, an almost unbiased
   regression estimator is proposed and derived. Our Monte Carlo simulation
   results suggest that the proposed estimator can bring significant
   improvement relative to other existing estimators. In addition, the real
   application results demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms
   both negative binomial ridge regression and maximum likelihood
   estimators in terms of predictive performance.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of an atomistic study on the Poisson's ratios of
   face-centered cubic metal (001) nanoplates under tensile loading. Here,
   we find that the behavior of the Poisson's ratios of metal nanoplates is
   strongly dependent on the characteristics of a phase transformation that
   takes place in their bulk counterparts as well as on the amount of
   compressive stress induced in the nanoplates. In addition, we discuss
   the effects of the nanoplate thickness and temperature on the mechanical
   behavior of the nanoplates. As the thickness decreases, the amount of
   compressive stress increases. As a result, the metal nanoplates become
   more auxetic. Higher temperatures cause the phase transformation to
   occur sooner. Thus, strongly auxetic nanoplates can be obtained by
   raising the temperature. In addition to investigating the effects of the
   thickness and temperature, we compare the behaviors of the Poisson's
   ratios of (001) nanoplates of six different metals. Interestingly, the
   behaviors of the Poisson's ratios of the metal nanoplates differ, even
   though their corresponding bulks have similar and positive Poisson's
   ratios. This is because the six metals exhibit large differences in
   their surface stresses as well as in the critical strains for the phase
   transformation. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials exhibit unusual properties, such as negative
   Poisson's ratio, which are difficult to achieve in conventional
   materials. Rational design of mechanical metamaterials at the microscale
   is becoming popular partly because of the advance in three-dimensional
   printing technologies. However, incorporating movable building blocks
   inside solids, thereby enabling us to manipulate mechanical movement at
   the molecular scale, has been a difficult task. Here, we report a
   metal-organic framework, self-assembled from a porphyrin linker and a
   new type of Zn-based secondary building unit, serving as a joint in a
   hinged cube tessellation. Detailed structural analysis and theoretical
   calculation show that this material is a mechanical metamaterial
   exhibiting auxetic behavior. This work demonstrates that the topology of
   the framework and flexible hinges inside the structure are intimately
   related to the mechanical properties of the material, providing a
   guideline for the rational design of mechanically responsive
   metal-organic frameworks.}},

Abstract = {{A new family of hypophosphite-based ABX(3) hybrid perovskite has caused
   a widespread range of attentions due to their structural diversity,
   phase transition, and magnetic and negative thermal expansion. As a
   continuation of searching for novel hybrid perovskites, this work
   reports a new hypophosphite-based hybrid perovskite,
   {[}Trz]{[}Mg(H2POO)(3)] (TrzMgP, Trz(+)=1,2,4-triazole), which belongs
   to the centrosymmetric space group P2(1)/c with ordered organic cations
   located in the perovskite cage windows. It is notable that the broad
   bandgap of TrzMgP is 5.82eV, and the calculated band structure and
   density of states disclose that the Trz(+) cations donate to the large
   indirect bandgaps with 4.36eV. In addition, the full elastic constants
   of TrzMgP were calculated by density functional theory which enables the
   systematic mapping of their Young's moduli, shear moduli, and Poisson's
   ratios. Notably, TrzMgP exhibits low anisotropy and comparable rigidity
   with the formate perovskite.}},

Abstract = {{A Molecular Dynamics simulation study has been carried out of the
   Lennard-Jones fluid in the stable liquid and metastable liquid-vapour
   co-existence regions. The interest has been mainly in states for which
   the pressure of the fluid is negative, and how they compare with those
   at positive pressure. The behaviour of the LJ fluid shows parallels with
   that of water, with the maximum tensile strength near the triple point
   being approximately seven times the critical pressure. The maximum
   tensile strength increases with cooling. Many of the properties, such as
   elastic moduli, show a smooth transition across the liquid-vapour
   boundary, on the liquid side, and a monotonic variation in the
   metastable region of the phase diagram. There is however a similarity in
   behaviour of combinations of the mechanical properties and the equation
   of state; for example, the pressure and infinite frequency Poissons
   ratio have minima at approximately the same densities. Insights into the
   heterogeneity of the assembly of particles are provided by probability
   distributions of the net force on a molecule and that of a definition
   for the local pressure experienced by a molecule, or `pressurelet'. The
   maximum negative pressure coincides with the maximum fraction of
   molecules individually experiencing a negative pressure.}},

Abstract = {{First-principles method was performed to investigate the stabilities,
   electronic structures and elastic properties of L1(2)-Al-3(Sc1-xZrx)
   with different Zr content, and the optimized structural parameters were
   consistent with previous literature. The obtained negative values of
   both formation and mixing enthalpies suggested all the
   L1(2)Al(3)(Sc1-xZrx) possessed structural stabilities. As Zr atoms
   replaced for Sc in L1(2)-Al-3(Sc1-xZrx) structure, the interactions
   between Zr-d state as well as Al-p and (Sc, Zr)-d were promoted, and not
   only the covalent bonding strength was enhanced, but also its bonding
   characteristics on (100) and (110) planes tended to be consistent. The
   bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and
   elastic anisotropy of these phases were also derived from the calculated
   elastic constants. It is found that for L1(2)-Al-3(Sc1-xZrx) that had
   high substitution of Zr atoms, the volume changing resistance was
   promoted with the resistance to reversible deformations being subdued.
   Besides, the ductility was enhanced for the increase of B/G ratio and
   Cauchy pressure value (C-12-C-44).}},

Abstract = {{The phase stability and mechanical properties of binary W1-xTax and
   W1-xRex alloys were investigated using the full-potential augmented
   plane-wave method. The special quasirandom structures(SQSs) of these
   alloys are mechanically stable due to all of the positive elastic
   constants and negative binding energies. The binding energies of both
   the W1-xTax and W1-xRex alloys also exhibit energy favorable asymmetry
   toward the W-rich side. In addition, the bulk modulus of the W1-xTax
   alloys decrease gradually with the increase of the Ta concentration,
   while those of the W1-xRex alloys increase gradually with the increase
   of the Re concentration. Consequently, the bulk modulus of W metal can
   be improved by doping with Re, implying that the resistance to
   deformation is enhanced. Based on the mechanical characteristic G/B and
   Poisson's ratio., both the W1-xTax and W1-xRex alloys are regarded as
   being ductile materials, the ductility of which improves with the
   increase of Ta or Re. (C) 2014 Author(s).}},

   its strength significantly reduced, and its elastic modulus increased,
   while the Poisson's ratio changed slightly. Xenon lamp aging affects the
   material properties of the specimens with protective coatings more
   slightly than those without any protective coatings. High temperature
   environment affects the material properties of specimens more obviously
   than low temperature environment does. Therefore, when designing the
   GFRP Pole and Tower for power transmission exposed in UV and adverse
   temperature environment long-term, designers should consider the
   negative impacts of the external environment, and take appropriate

Title = {{Unexpected buckled structures and tunable electronic properties in
   arsenic nanosheets: insights from first-principles calculations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Using dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations, we
   investigate the structural and electronic properties of arsenic (As)
   nanosheet, which is a cousin of phosphorene. We find that the
   black-phosphorus like structure is dynamically unstable for As, which
   has an out-of-plane soft mode from its flat As zigzag lines. Hence
   different from phosphorene, the stable As monolayer possesses a unique
   buckling along the zigzag direction, which leads to a surface
   corrugation of 0.20 angstrom and a robust dynamic stability. The zigzag
   buckling alters the band feature of As nanosheet, transforming it from
   an indirect band gap semiconductor to a direct one for the buckled
   structure. Strain engineering can further tune the surface corrugation
   and band structure of As nanosheet, for which the direct or indirect gap
   feature can be switched by the zigzag-directional strains, while the
   strains along armchair direction could modulate the band gap and induce
   a metallic behaviour. Prominent anisotropic Dirac-like electronic
   structures and orientation-dependent elastic behaviours with a
   remarkable negative Poisson ratio are both found in the As nanosheets,
   enabling the system promising applications for nano-electrics and
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Properties of fully nonlinear ion-acoustic solitary waves in a plasma
   with positive-negative ions and nonthermal electrons are investigated.
   For this purpose, the hydrodynamic equations for the positive-negative
   ions, nonthermal electron density distribution, and the Poisson equation
   are used to derive the energy integral equation with a new Sagdeev
   potential. The latter is analyzed to examine the existence regions of
   the solitary pulses. It is found that the solitary excitations strongly
   depend on the mass and density ratios of the positive and negative ions
   as well as the nonthermal electron parameter. Numerical solution of the
   energy integral equation clears that both positive and negative
   potentials exist together. It is found that faster solitary pulses are
   taller and narrower. Furthermore, increasing the electron nonthermality
   parameter (negative-to-positive ions density ratio) decreases
   (increases) the localized excitation amplitude but increases (decreases)
   the pulse width. The present model is used to investigate the solitary
   excitations in the (H+,O-2(-)) and (H+,H-) plasmas, where they are
   presented in the D- and F-regions of the Earth's ionosphere. This
   investigation should be helpful in understanding the salient features of
   the fully nonlinear ion-acoustic solitary waves in space and in
   laboratory plasmas where two distinct groups of ions and non-Boltzmann
   distributed electrons are present.}},

Abstract = {{The thermodynamic, elastic and electronic properties of AlSc2Si2 have
   been studied using first-principles calculations for the first time.
   Thermodynamically, AlSc2Si2 is more inclined to form than Al3Sc due to a
   more negative H-f value. In comparison with elastic properties of Al3Sc,
   AlSc2Si2 has the slightly higher values in elastic moduli, and the
   similar values in Poisson's ratio and B/G ratio. The biggest difference
   lies in the universal elastic anisotropy index (A(U)). Al3Sc has the
   small values of A(U) both theoretically and experimentally indicating
   its near isotropy, while AlSc2Si2 shows a much larger A(U) value of 0567
   indicating the considerable anisotropy. The calculated DOS spectra
   indicate that AlSc2Si2 has a metallic character. Further, the appearance
   of the pseudogap around the Fermi level in DOS should support the high
   stability of AlSc2Si2. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Activity coefficients of La(NO3)(3), La(ClO4)(3), and La-2(SO4)(3) are

   study high dilution levels previously unattainable (10(-4) to 10(-5) mol
   kg(-1) depending on the salt). Literature values are found to be correct
   for La(ClO4)(3), moderately biased for La(NO3)(3) and completely
   incorrect for La-2(SO4)(3). This last salt in the diluted regions
   displays dramatic negative deviations-not recognised earlier because the
   measurements terminated at ca. 10(-3) mol kg(-1), where a
   Debye-Huckel-like misleading trend occurs. Numerical integration of the
   Poisson Boltzmann equation and Bjerrum's theory of ion pairing show an
   astounding ability to reproduce the trend of La-2(SO4)(3); however,
   there is evidence of short-range interactions that add to long-range
   interactions for lanthanum and bivalent metal sulfates, as if sulfate
   ions were displacing water from the hydration shells of the cations.

Abstract = {{A photonic crystal (PhC) is a periodic structure with periodicity
   comparable with the wavelength of light, having a photonic band gap in
   the visible range. In this contribution we discuss the possible use of
   PhCs as strain sensors, based on the observation that a distortion in
   the crystal structure produces a change in the reflected bandwidth.
   First, we demonstrate the feasible fabrication of a PhC having
   sub-micrometric polystyrene colloidal spheres in a PDMS matrix on a
   rubber substrate, and we demonstrate that the photonic properties change
   with substrate elongation according to theoretical prediction. The
   crystal sensitivity to strain depends directly on interplanar spacing
   and on Poisson's ratio. To enhance the crystal strain resolution, we
   propose to fabricate inverse photonic crystals with FCC structure, which
   are known from the literature to exhibit a high negative Poisson's
   ratio. We carried out a theoretical investigation to predict the
   opto-mechanical response of inverse PhCs, and carried out preliminary
   tests to demonstrate their fabrication feasibility.}},

   Anti-Tetrachiral Auxetic Core for Vibroacoustic Applications}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA}},
Abstract = {{This work proposes a novel two-dimensional (2D) graded core with
   anti-tetrachiral cells and evaluates the numerical vibroacoustic
   response of sandwich panels with these particular cores. First, a
   homogenization scheme is utilized to model the sandwich structure,
   followed by a modal analysis of the homogenized model in the frequency
   range of 0-200 Hz. The results have been compared with those obtained
   from an exact and full-scale finite element model of the sandwich
   structure. A general good agreement has been observed for the first six
   natural frequencies. Next, the radiated sound power level in the
   frequency band of 0-200 Hz is calculated and minimized for different
   geometry parameters of the sandwich structure. A hybrid design
   optimization approach using method of moving asymptotes and genetic
   algorithm is used. The optimized 2D gradient configurations show a
   significant 78\% reduction of the normalized radiated sound power level
   and a 15\% increase of the fundamental frequency, compared to the
   baseline sandwich panel configurations.}},

Abstract = {{The phase stability, electronic structure, elastic and metallic
   properties of manganese nitrides (Mn4N, Mn2N0.86, Mn3N2, and MnN) were
   extensively studied by first principles calculations. The negative
   values of cohesive energy and formation enthalpy show that these
   compounds are thermodynamically stable. The bonding of Manganese
   nitrides is the combinations of covalent and metallic bonds. In
   addition, a strong hybridization exists nearby the Fermi level, being
   characteristic of N-p and Mn-d states. The elastic properties of these
   nitrides (Mn4N, Mn2N0.86, and MnN) were calculated, which included bulk
   modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and hardness.
   The calculated results reveal that Mn2N0.86 and MnN are ductile while
   Mn4N is brittle, and the hardness values of these nitrides are 24.35
   GPa, 12.01 GPa, and 17.06 GPa, respectively. The MnN compound has the
   highest Debye temperature (632.1 K), while Mn2N0.86 has the lowest Debye
   temperature (390.5 K). The anisotropy of Young's modulus for Mn4N and
   MnN compounds is more prominent than Mn2N0.86 at the three crystalline
   planes. Moreover, the compound of Mn3N2 has an unstable structure in
   mechanical stability.}},

Abstract = {{The article presents the advancements in the technological processes
   developed to produce chiral honeycombs made of thin composite laminates.
   An original technological process, which was applied to produce chiral
   components for aerospace morphing structures, is critically analysed and
   a new approach is proposed. The objective of such approach is the
   production of thin-walled chiral composite structures with enhanced
   strength properties by using a more feasible technology. According to
   the new methodology, chiral honeycombs with polygonal nodes are obtained
   by assembling thin-walled prismatic composite tubes. Numerical models
   are developed to investigate the behaviour of such topologies. A
   comparison with the performances of chiral honeycombs with cylindrical
   nodes is presented, showing that the new configuration can provide
   negative Poisson's ratios that tend to the theoretical limit of -1 as
   the stiffness of the polygonal nodes is increased. Thereafter, a method
   to fill partially the nodes is proposed and numerically assessed, to
   enhance at the same time the auxetic behaviour and the mechanical
   properties of the chiral honeycomb. Finally a complete manufacturing
   process is developed. Hexa-chiral structural units are manufactured and
   subsequently tested to assess the auxetic response. Results are in
   acceptable agreement with numerical predictions and indicate that the
   novel technological route provides a significant contribution for the
   application of composite chiral honeycomb to morphing structures. y(C)

Title = {{An analytical solution for settlement of jacked piles considering pile
   installation effects}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Abstract = {{This paper develops an analytical solution for the settlement of jacked
   piles induced by reconsolidation of the surrounding soil. The Terzaghi's
   radial consolidation theory is utilised to model the dissipation of the
   installation-induced excess pore water pressure. A two-layer subgrade
   model, more general than single-layer ones and capable of being easily
   extended to multilayer soil systems, is adopted to analyse the
   settlement of the soil surrounding jacked piles so as to predict the
   additional settlement of the piles. The pile-soil interaction is
   properly considered in deriving the differential equations to formulate
   the problem considered. Example analysis is performed to illustrate the
   application of the proposed solution. Results indicate that the
   additional settlement of jacked piles, induced by reconsolidation of the
   surrounding soil, should be considered in calculation of the settlement
   of the pile after installation. Parametric studies are conducted to
   investigate the impact of the Poisson's ratio, overconsolidation ratio,
   shear modulus and initial void ratio on the settlement of the pile due
   to consolidation of the surrounding soil. The results show that the
   Poisson's ratio and the overconsolidation ratio of the upper stratum
   have pronounced effects on the settlement of the pile top.}},

   investigated through equilibrium principle, strain energy analysis,
   micropolar elasticity and homogenization theories. Afterwards,
   multifunctional properties of chiral mechanical metamaterials are
   elaborated, such as: vibration attenuation, impact energy absorption and
   negative coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). Finally, several
   successful industrial applications of chiral mechanical metamaterials
   are demonstrated, such as: morphing airfoil smart deployable antenna and
   reconfigurable structures, auxetic stent, chiral flexible electronics
   and phase transforming metastructures, etc. Finally, perspectives and

Abstract = {{Patients that are exposed to biotechnology-derived therapeutics often
   develop antibodies to the therapeutic, the magnitude of which is
   assessed by measuring antibody titers. A statistical approach for
   analyzing antibody titer data conditional on seroconversion is
   presented. The proposed method is to first transform the antibody titer
   data based on a geometric series using a common ratio of 2 and a scale
   factor of 50 and then analyze the exponent using a zero-inflated or
   hurdle model assuming a Poisson or negative binomial distribution with
   random effects to account for patient heterogeneity. Patient specific
   covariates can be used to model the probability of developing an
   antibody response, i.e., seroconversion, as well as the magnitude of the
   antibody titer itself. The method was illustrated using antibody titer
   data from 87 male seroconverted Fabry patients receiving Fabrazyme (R).
   Titers from five clinical trials were collected over 276 weeks of
   therapy with anti-Fabrazyme IgG titers ranging from 100 to 409,600 after
   exclusion of seronegative patients. The best model to explain
   seroconversion was a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model where cumulative
   dose (under a constant dose regimen of dosing every 2 weeks) influenced
   the probability of seroconversion. There was an 80\% chance of
   seroconversion when the cumulative dose reached 210 mg (90\% confidence
   interval: 194-226 mg). No difference in antibody titers was noted
   between Japanese or Western patients. Once seroconverted, antibody
   titers did not remain constant but decreased in an exponential manner
   from an initial magnitude to a new lower steady-state value. The
   expected titer after the new steady-state titer had been achieved was
   870 (90\% CI: 630-1109). The half-life to the new steady-state value
   after seroconversion was 44 weeks (90\% CI: 17-70 weeks). Time to
   seroconversion did not appear to be correlated with titer at the time of
   seroconversion. The method can be adequately used to model antibody
   titer data.}},

Title = {{The influence of Ti additions on the mechanical and electrochemical
   behavior of beta-Ta5Si3 nanocrystalline coating}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{419}},
Pages = {{901-915}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of Ti substitutional additions on the
   mechanical and electrochemical corrosion behavior of beta-Ta5Si3 were
   investigated through both theoretical calculation and experiment.
   Initially, first-principles calculations, based on density functional
   theory, were used to guide compositional design, according to the
   calculation of mechanical parameters (for example, bulk modulus, shear
   modulus, Young's modulus, the shear modulus/bulk modulus ratio and
   Poisson's ratio). This analysis showed that optimum mechanical
   performance may be achieved through Ta atoms in the Ta20Si12 unit cell
   being replaced by two Ti atoms. Subsequently, both the binary
   beta-TasSi(3) coating and the optimized Ti-alloyed beta-Ta5Si3 coating
   (i.e., beta-(Ta0.902Ti0.098)(5)Si-3) were deposited onto Ti-6AI-4V
   substrates using a double cathode glow discharge plasma method. Both
   as-deposited coatings exhibited a tetragonal crystal structure with fine
   equiaxed grains similar to 4 nm in diameter. The mechanical properties
   of the coatings were determined by both nanoindentation and Vickers
   indentation techniques, and their electrochemical corrosion behavior was
   examined by potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky analysis in naturally aerated 0.9
   wt.\% NaCl solution at 37 degrees C. These investigations showed that
   the addition of Ti significantly improved the damage resistance of
   beta-Ta5Si3, with little negative impact on its corrosion resistance.

Title = {{COMPARING METHODS FOR ANALYZING OVERDISPERSED COUNT DATA IN AQUATIC
   TOXICOLOGY}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{212-219}},

Abstract = {{Endpoints in aquatic toxicity tests can be measured using a variety of
   measurement scales including dichotomous (survival), continuous (growth)
   and count (number of young). A distribution is assumed for an endpoint
   and analyses proceed accordingly. In certain situations, the assumed
   distribution may be incorrect and this may lead to incorrect statistical
   inference. The present study considers the analysis of count effects,
   here motivated by the Ceriodaphnia dubia reproduction study. While the
   Poisson probability model is a common starting point, this distribution
   assumes that the mean and variance are the same. This will not be the
   case if there is some extraneous source of variability in the system,
   and in this case, the variability may exceed the mean. A computer
   simulation study was used to examine the impact of overdispersion or
   outliers on the analysis of count data. Methods that assumed Poisson or
   negative binomially distributed outcomes were compared to methods that
   accommodated this potential overdispersion using quasi-likelihood (QL)
   or generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). If the data were truly
   Poisson, the adjusted methods still performed at nominal type I error
   rates. In the cases of overdispersed counts, the Poisson assumed methods
   resulted in rejection rates that exceeded nominal levels and standard
   errors for regression coefficients that were too narrow. The negative
   binomial methods worked best in the case when the data were, in fact,
   negative binomial but did not maintain nominal characteristics in other
   situations. In general, the QL and GLMM methods performed reasonably
   based on the present study, although all procedures suffered some impact
   in the presence of potential outliers. In particular, the QL is arguably
   preferred because it makes fewer assumptions than the GLMM and performed
   well over the range of conditions considered. Environ. Toxicol. Chem.

Abstract = {{By 3D printing lattice structure with active materials, the structures
   can exhibit shape and functional changes under external stimulus.
   However, the programmable shape changes of the 3D printed lattice
   structures are limited due to the complex geometries, nonlinear
   behaviors of the active materials, and the diverse external stimuli. In
   this work, we propose a design framework combining experiments,
   theoretical modeling, and finite element simulations for the
   controllable shape changes of the 3D printed horseshoe under thermal
   stimulus. The theoretical model is based on a phase evolution model that
   combines the geometrical nonlinearity and the material nonlinearity.
   Results show that the shapes with positive or negative Poisson's ratio
   and bending intermediate shapes can be programmed by tuning the
   geometrical parameters and the temperature distribution. This work
   provides a method to aid the design of 3D printed functional lattice
   structures and have potential applications in soft robotics,
   biomedicine, and energy absorbing fields.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental research on the

   parameters was tested: the loading level (0.3 and 0.7f(ed)); the cooling
   process (cooling in the air and by water jet) and the maximum
   temperature that the concrete was subjected to (20, 300, 500 and 700

   compression, direct and splitting tensile and flexural strengths,
   modulus of elasticity and Poisson's ratio. The results showed in general
   that the higher the temperature and faster the cooling process is, as
   the one by water jet, the higher the negative impact on the residual
   mechanical properties of the concrete is, being the strength nearly null

   all-carbon networks is briefly reviewed. It is shown that recently
   elaborated synthetic routes using new precursors (usually with multiple
   triple bonds molecules make possible synthesis of more and more extended
   carbon networks of different structures. Such all-carbon networks, would
   be new, kinetically stable, allotropic forms of carbon. Computer
   simulations show that they should exhibit new interesting properties
   e.g. negative Poisson coefficient. It is concluded that although the
   construction of all-carbon networks is still in its infancy but very
   important advances in synthesis of small sections of such structures
   have been made and hopefully, at the end of XX century we will have new
   allotropes of carbon in our hands.}},

Abstract = {{The rise in the use of statistical models for non-Gaussian data, such as
   generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized linear mixed models
   (GLMMs), is pushing aside the traditional approach of transforming data
   and applying least-squares linear models (LMs). Nonetheless, many
   least-squares statistical tests depend on the variance of the sum of
   residuals, which by the Central Limit Theoremconverge to a Gaussian
   distribution for large sample sizes. Therefore, least-squares LMs will
   likely have good performance in assessing the statistical significance
   of regression coefficients. Using simulations of count data, I compared
   GLM approaches for testing whether regression coefficients differ from
   zero with the traditional approach of applying LMs to transformed data.
   Simulations assumed that variation among sample populations was either
   (i) negative binomial or (ii) log-normal Poisson (i.e. log-normal
   variation among populations that were then sampled by a Poisson
   distribution). I used the simulated data to conduct tests of the
   hypotheses that regression coefficients differed from zero; I did not
   investigate statistical properties of the coefficient estimators, such
   as bias and precision. For negative binomial simulations whose
   assumptions closely matched the GLMs, the GLMs were nonetheless prone to
   type I errors (false positives) especially when there was more than one
   predictor (independent) variable. After correcting for type I errors,
   however, the GLMs provided slightly better statistical power than LMs.
   For log-normal-Poisson simulations, both a GLMM and the LMs performed
   well, but under some simulated conditions the GLMs had high type I error
   rates, a deadly sin for statistical tests. These results show that,
   while GLMs have slight advantages in power when they are properly
   specified, they can lead to badly wrong conclusions about the
   significance of regression coefficients if they are mis-specified. In
   contrast, transforming data and applying least-squares linear analyses
   provide robust statistical tests for significance over a wide range of
   conditions. Thus, the traditional approach of transforming data and
   applying LMs is still useful.}},

Title = {{Ballistic Resistance of Honeycomb Sandwich Panels under In-Plane
   High-Velocity Impact}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{The dynamic responses of honeycomb sandwich panels (HSPs) subjected to
   in-plane projectile impact were studied by means of explicit nonlinear
   finite element simulations using LS-DYNA. The HSPs consisted of two
   identical aluminum alloy face-sheets and an aluminum honeycomb core
   featuring three types of unit cell configurations (regular,
   rectangular-shaped, and reentrant hexagons). The ballistic resistances
   of HSPs with the three core configurations were first analyzed. It was
   found that the HSP with the reentrant auxetic honeycomb core has the
   best ballistic resistance, due to the negative Poisson's ratio effect of
   the core. Parametric studies were then carried out to clarify the
   influences of both macroscopic (face-sheet and core thicknesses, core
   relative density) and mesoscopic (unit cell angle and size) parameters
   on the ballistic responses of the auxetic HSPs. Numerical results show
   that the perforation resistant capabilities of the auxetic HSPs increase
   as the values of the macroscopic parameters increase. However, the
   mesoscopic parameters show nonmonotonic effects on the panels' ballistic
   capacities. The empirical equations for projectile residual velocities
   were formulated in terms of impact velocity and the structural
   parameters. It was also found that the blunter projectiles result in
   higher ballistic limits of the auxetic HSPs.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we address the problem of computing the distribution
   functions that can be expressed as discrete mixtures of continuous
   distributions. Examples include noncentral chisquare, noncentral beta,
   noncentral F, noncentral t, and the distribution of squared sample

   pointing out situations where existing algorithms fail to compute
   meaningful values of the cumulative distribution functions (cdf) under
   study. To address this problem we recommend an approach that can be
   easily incorporated to improve the existing algorithms. For the
   distributions of the squared sample multiple correlation coefficient,
   noncentral t, and noncentral chisquare, we apply the approach and give a
   detailed explanation of computing the cdf values. We present results of
   comparison studies carried out to validate the calculated values and
   computational times of our suggested approach. Finally, we give the
   algorithms for computing the distributions of the squared sample
   multiple correlation coefficient, noncentral t, and noncentral chisquare
   so that they can be coded in any desired computer language. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{A new approach for a compressor casing design has been developed using
   new design possibilities offered by additive manufacturing technologies.
   Tip clearance behaviour is a serious problem in compressor design
   leading to increased aerodynamic losses and limiting the operating range
   of a compressor through a decrease in surge margin. Efforts are
   necessary to minimise the tip clearance in the load cycle of an engine.
   The approach presented in this work uses auxetic structures in a
   double-walled compressor casing with the aim to force the radial
   expansion behaviour of the inner casing wall in order to adapt the
   casing to the rotor. The studies of the casing and the calculations of
   the transient rotor displacement are carried out by using
   coupled-temperature-displacement calculations using commercial
   FEM-tools.
   Elements which influence the radial expansion of the casing are
   identified with the aim of generating a modular system for future
   compressor casing developments. So the casing elements are adaptable to
   the radial expansion of a certain rotor. An improved tip clearance
   behaviour in relevant operating points is achieved. In the latter part
   of the paper, practical design considerations are made as the auxetic
   structures are integrated into the CAD model of an existing compressor
   casing. Design challenges are also briefly discussed.
   This paper presents a new potential application of additive
   manufacturing technologies in future aero engine design. The focus of
   this paper is on the practical implementation of the new design freedom
   using the example of a compressor casing. The advantages for the overall
   engine performance as well as identified problems are also discussed
   qualitatively.}},

   that the calculated equilibrium lattice parameters at 0 GPa well agree
   with the experimental results. The negative formation enthalpy indicates
   that Ni3Nb phase is thermodynamically stable in the ground state, and
   the stability becomes better as the pressure is increased. The bigger
   ratio of B/G (larger than 1.75) and positive Cauchy pressure indicate
   that Ni3Nb phase is ductile. Moreover, Ni3Nb phase exhibits high elastic
   anisotropy, and the elastic anisotropies become increasingly pronounced
   with the increase of pressure. Additionally, the anisotropic chemical
   bonds of Ni3Nb phase reduce the minimum thermal conductivity. The
   minimum thermal conductivity increases with the increased pressure. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates that the conditional negative binomial model for
   panel data, proposed by Hausman, Hall, and Griliches (1984), is not a
   true fixed-effects method. This method which has been implemented in
   both Stata and LIMDEP-does not in fact control for all stable
   covariates. Three alternative methods are explored. A negative
   multinomial model yields the same estimator as the conditional Poisson
   estimator and hence does not provide any additional leverage for dealing
   with overdispersion. On the other hand, a simulation study yields good
   results from applying an unconditional negative binomial regression

   no evidence for any incidental parameters bias in the coefficients, and
   downward bias in the standard error estimates can be easily and
   effectively corrected using the deviance statistic. Finally, an
   approximate conditional method is found to perform at about the same
   level as the unconditional estimator.}},

Title = {{Racial/Ethnic Heterogeneity and Rural-Urban Disparity of COVID-19 Case
   Fatality Ratio in the USA: a Negative Binomial and GIS-Based Analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES}},
Abstract = {{The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has exacerbated inequality in
   the United States of America (USA). Black, indigenous, and people of
   color (BIPOC) are disproportionately affected by the pandemic. This
   study examines determinants of COVID-19 case fatality ratio (CFR) based
   on publicly sourced data from January 1 to December 18, 2020, and
   sociodemographic and rural-urban continuum data from the US Census
   Bureau. Nonspatial negative binomial Poisson regression and
   geographically weighted Poisson regression were applied to estimate the
   global and local relationships between the CFR and
   predictors-rural-urban continuum, political inclination, and
   race/ethnicity in 2407 rural counties. The mean COVID-19 CFR among rural
   counties was 1.79 (standard deviation (SD) = 1.07; 95\% CI 1.73-1.84)
   higher than the total US counties (M = 1.69, SD = 1.18; 95\% CI:
   1.65-1.73). Based on the global NB model, CFR was positively associated
   with counties classified as ``completely rural{''} (incidence rate ratio
   (IRR) = 1.24; 95\% CI: 1.12-1.39) and ``mostly rural{''} (IRR = 1.26;
   95\% CI: 1.15-1.38) relative to ``mostly urban{''} counties. Nonspatial
   regression indicates that COVID-19 CFR increases by a factor of 8.62,
   5.87, 2.61, and 1.36 for one unit increase in county-level percent
   Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, and Asian/Pacific Islanders,
   respectively. Local spatial regression shows CFR was significantly
   higher in rural counties with a higher share of BIPOC in the Northeast
   and Midwest regions, and political inclination predicted COVID-19 CFR in
   rural counties in the Midwest region. In conclusion, spatial and
   racial/ethnic disparities exist for COVID-19 CFR across the US rural
   counties, and findings from this study have implications for public
   health.}},

Title = {{Elasto-Plastic Behaviour of Transversely Isotropic Cellular Materials
   with Inner Gas Pressure}},
Journal = {{METALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The fabrication process of cellular materials, such as foaming, usually
   leads to cells elongated in one direction, but equiaxed in a plane
   normal to that direction. This study is aimed at understanding the
   elasto-plastic behaviour of transversely isotropic cellular materials
   with inner gas pressure. An idealised ellipsoidal-cell
   face-centred-cubic foam that is filled with gas was generated and
   modelled to obtain the uniaxial stress-strain relationship, Poisson's
   ratio and multiaxial yield surface. The effects of the elongation ratio
   and gas pressure on the elasto-plastic properties for a relative density
   of 0.5 were investigated. It was found that an increase in the
   elongation ratio caused increases in both the elastic modulus and yield
   stress for uniaxial loading along the cell elongation direction, and led
   to a tilted multiaxial yield surface in the mean stress and Mises
   equivalent stress plane. Compared to isotropic spheroidal-cell foams,
   the size of the yield surface of the ellipsoidal-cell foam is smaller
   for high-stress triaxiality, but larger for low-stress triaxiality, and
   the yield surface rotates counter-clockwise with the Lode angle
   increasing. The gas pressure caused asymmetry of the uniaxial
   stress-strain curve (e.g., reduced tensile yield stress), and it
   increased the nominal plastic Poisson's ratio for compression, but had
   the opposite effect for tension. Furthermore, the gas pressure shifted
   the yield surface towards the negative mean stress axis with a distance
   equal to the gas pressure. The combined effects of the elongation ratio
   and gas pressure are complicated, particularly for the elasto-plastic
   properties in the plane in which the cells are equiaxed.}},

Journal = {{SUPERLATTICES AND MICROSTRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{360-372}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This work intents to put forth the results of a classical molecular
   dynamics study to investigate the temperature dependent elastic
   constants of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) between 100 and
   1000 K for the first time using strain fluctuation method. The
   temperature dependence of out-of-plane fluctuations (ripples) is
   quantified and is explained using continuum theory of membranes. At low
   temperatures, negative in-plane thermal expansion is observed and at
   high temperatures, a transition to positive thermal expansion has been
   observed due to the presence of thermally excited ripples. The decrease
   of Young's modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio with
   increase in temperature has been analyzed. The thermal rippling in h-BN
   leads to strong anharmonic behaviour that causes large deviation from
   the isotropic elasticity. A detailed study shows that the strong thermal
   rippling in large systems is also responsible for the softening of
   elastic constants in h-BN. From the determined values of elastic
   constants and elastic moduli, it has been elucidated that 2D h-BN sheets
   meet the Born's mechanical stability criterion in the investigated
   temperature range. The variation of longitudinal and shear velocities
   with temperature is also calculated from the computed values of elastic
   constants and elastic moduli. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The crystal structures and elastic properties of the anhydrous zinc and
   cadmium oxalates and lead oxalate dihydrate are determined using
   rigorous first-principles solid-state methods. The three materials are
   shown to display negative Poisson's ratios (NPR) and to exhibit the
   negative linear compressibility (NLC) phenomenon. Anhydrous zinc and
   cadmium oxalates display NLC for a very wide range of external pressures
   applied in the direction of minimum compressibility in the ranges -1.3
   to 5.5 GPa and -1.2 to 2.7 GPa, respectively. The increase of volume in
   both materials is substantial for pressures larger than 3.6 and 1.8 GPa,
   and the compressibilities become -70.1 and -67.0 TPa-1 for pressures of
   5.2 and 2.6 GPa, respectively. The increase of volume is so drastic that
   these materials become unstable for pressures larger than 5.5 and 2.7
   GPa. Lead oxalate dihydrate also displays NLC along the direction of
   minimum Poisson's ratio for negative pressures in the range -0.05 to
   -0.08 GPa and undergoes a pressure-induced phase transition for
   relatively low external pressures of the order of 0.1 GPa. The presence
   of NPR and NLC phenomena in these three materials together with the
   previous finding of these phenomena for silver oxalate strongly suggests
   that other metal oxalate materials could also exhibit an extremely
   anomalous mechanical behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine contemporary treatment patterns for women
   diagnosed with stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in the
   United States.
   Methods: We identified 48,961 patients diagnosed with stage I-III TNBC
   from 2010 to 2013 in the National Cancer Data Base and created 3
   treatment subcohorts (definitive locoregional therapy {[}appropriate
   local therapy, including surgery/radiation], adjuvant chemotherapy
   {[}stage II-III disease or stage I tumors with tumor size >= 1 cm], and
   adjuvant chemotherapy for small tumors {[}stage I tumors with tumor size
   <1 cm and node negative]). We performed descriptive analyses, calculated
   percentages for treatment receipt, and used multivariable modified
   Poisson regression models to estimate risk ratios (RRs) with 95\%
   confidence intervals (CIs) predicting receipt of treatments.
   Results: Older age, larger tumor size, positive nodal status, and
   Southern/Pacific US regions, but not race/ethnicity, were strongly
   associated with a lower probability of receiving definitive locoregional
   therapy. Older age was also strongly associated with lower likelihood of
   adjuvant chemotherapy receipt, as were grade, negative nodal status, and
   higher comorbidity. For example, compared with women aged 18 to 39
   years, those aged 75 to 90 years were 17\% less likely to receive
   definitive locoregional therapy (RR, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.73-0.88), and 62\%
   less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (RR, 0.38; 95\% CI,
   0.35-0.41). Age, tumor grade, tumor size, and comorbidity score were
   also independently associated with receipt of chemotherapy for women
   with small TNBC.
   Conclusions: Advancing age but not race/ethnicity was associated with
   lower likelihood of recommended treatment receipt among women with TNBC.
   Although omission of therapy among older patients with breast cancer may
   be appropriate in the case of smaller and lower risk TNBC, some were
   likely undertreated.}},

Title = {{Effect of steel fibers on geopolymer properties - The best synopsis for
   civil engineer}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{246}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Recently, the introduction of steel fibers to geopolymers as a
   reinforcement has developed and increased owing to the rapid development
   of geopolymers. Despite geopolymers exhibit potential properties such as
   low energy consumption and carbon footprint, flame resistance, fire
   resistance, valuable compressive strength and good durability, they
   suffer from low flexural and tensile strengths. To solve these problems,
   steel fibers are added to geopolymers to improve their ductility,
   toughness, flexural and tensile strengths. The present paper targets to
   summarize the earlier studies carried out on the influence of steel
   fibers on the fresh and the hardened properties of the geopolymers. This
   review confirmed that the incorporations of steel fibers into
   geopolymers have a positive effect on flexural strength, splitting
   tensile strength, ductility, modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity,
   Poisson's ratio, toughness, chemical resistance, shrinkage, sorptivity,
   water absorption, permeability, water penetration depth, load carrying
   capacity, crack propagation and post-cracking. In addition, in most
   cases compressive strength increased. On the other hand, they have a
   negative effect on porosity and workability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Influence of Paraffin on the Microproperties of Asphalt Binder Using MD
   Simulation}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has proved that paraffin has a negative effect on the
   mechanical properties of asphalt binder; however, until now there are
   very few studies on the fundamental mechanisms on a microscale. To study
   the effect of paraffin on the microproperties of asphalt binder, three
   molecular asphalt binder models with different paraffin contents and two
   molecular models of SBS-modified asphalt binders are created in this
   paper. The glass transition temperature is then simulated by means of a
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, indicating a significant reduction
   of low-temperature stability due to paraffin. Simulations of density,
   Young's moduli, Poisson's ratio, bulk moduli, and shear moduli are also
   conducted. The results show that paraffin can influence the mechanical
   properties substantially, and reduces the high-temperature stability of
   asphalt binders. Simulation results on the self-healing behavior of
   asphalt binder with varying paraffin contents demonstrate that paraffin
   significantly slows the self-healing behavior rate. Based on the
   molecular simulation results, it is suggested that the paraffin content
   in asphalt binder should be maintained at a controlled minimum amount.

Abstract = {{This paper deals with a metamaterial for sensing purposes under Industry
   4.0 applications. The presented of metamaterial is based on an auxetic
   structure which is made by Direct Metal Laser Sintering technology. The
   stain steel auxetic structure could integrate smart material elements or
   systems for electromechanical conversions. The proposed concept of
   metamaterial uses the auxetic structure with piezoelectric elements or
   stacks to transduce external load of structure into electric signal. The
   auxetic structure could provide uniform mechanical load on several smart
   piezoelectric elements in middle layers due to negative Poisson ration.
   The paper presents a FEM simulation of this concept and analysis of
   coupled electromechanical system under harmonic excitation. Deformation
   of auxetic structure with piezoceramic PZT plates is presented and the
   voltage response is analyzed. The assembly of metamaterial system with
   piezoelectric PVDF in case of soft application is also presented and it
   will be tested under future development.}},

Title = {{Propagation of three-dimensional ion-acoustic solitary waves in
   magnetized negative ion plasmas with nonthermal electrons}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Properties of small amplitude nonlinear ion-acoustic solitary waves in a
   warm magneto plasma with positive-negative ions and nonthermal electrons
   are investigated. For this purpose, the hydrodynamic equations for the
   positive-negative ions, nonthermal electron density distribution, and
   the Poisson equation are used to derive the corresponding nonlinear
   evolution equation; Zkharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, in the small
   amplitude regime. The ZK equation is analyzed to examine the existence
   regions of the solitary pulses. It is found that compressive and
   rarefactive ion-acoustic solitary waves strongly depend on the mass and
   density ratios of the positive and negative ions as well as the
   nonthermal electron parameter. Also, it is found that there are two
   critical values for the density ratio of the negative-to-positive ions
   (upsilon), the ratio between unperturbed electron-to-positive ion
   density (mu), and the nonthermal electron parameter (beta), which decide
   the existence of positive and negative ion-acoustic solitary waves. The
   present study is applied to examine the small amplitude nonlinear
   ion-acoustic solitary excitations for the (H+, O-2(-)) and (H+, H-)
   plasmas, where they are found in the D- and F-regions of the Earth's
   ionosphere. This investigation should be helpful in understanding the
   salient features of the nonlinear ion-acoustic solitary waves in space
   and in laboratory plasmas where two distinct groups of ions and
   non-Boltzmann distributed electrons are present.}},

   calculations and updates experiments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The crystal structure, stability, and electronic and mechanical
   properties of D0(22) Al3Ti-Al3Nb pseudobinary solid solution were
   systematically investigated by a first-principles method and experiment.
   The calculated formation energies demonstrated that all the
   Al-3(Ti1-xNbx) (0 <= x <= 1) solid solutions considered are
   thermodynamically stable and that the stability decreases monotonously
   with increasing Nb concentration. Lattice parameter a of Al-3(Ti1-xNbx)
   exhibits strong negative deviation from a linear composition dependence,
   while the trend is reversed for lattice parameter c. Study of the
   mechanical properties (including the bulk modulus, shear modulus,
   Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature) reveals that Nb
   atom substitution in Al3Ti enhances the mechanical stability and
   strength. The analysis of calculated electronic structures reveals that
   the metallic behavior of Al-3(Ti1-xNbx) depends on the Nb concentration.
   Experimentally, Al-3(Ti1-xNbx) was synthesized and was characterized by
   means of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Rietveld
   refinement results confirmed that the lattice parameters are in the
   range of our previous calculated values. The differences between the
   calculated and experimental lattice parameters are also discussed in
   detail.}},

   is designed to improve the frontal crashworthiness of the vehicle, which

Abstract = {{The roller honeycomb feeding roller (RHFR) of forest harvester in
   logging was raised for reducing damage to logs. The equivalent
   relationship of roller double V-wings honeycomb (RDWH) were proposed and
   analytically derived in the mass, platform stress and elastic modulus.
   The finite element models of RDWH with various cell densities under the
   equivalent relation were established. The mechanical properties, energy
   absorption characteristics, impact response, structural stability,
   structure efficiency and improvement performance efficiency of RDWH
   under compression impact were investigated in comparison with roller
   hexagonal honeycomb (RHH). The RDWHs with equivalent relationship had
   approximate mechanical properties under unit compression displacement.
   The RDWH, benefiting from the NPR enhancement phenomenon in deformation,
   possessed about multiple times of mechanical properties and energy
   absorption efficiency than RHH. The performance efficiency of RDWH
   related to cell densities and cell layers in ``PVP{''} and ``Bunching
   Phase{''} trend. The RHFR exceeded that of the steel feeding roller
   (SFR) with about 2 times in maximum contact area under the corresponding
   contact force. The phenomenon of ``sequential increment{''} and ``uprush

   energy variation with strain technique. The polycrystalline elastic
   moduli (namely: the shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio,
   sound velocities, Debye temperature and melting temperature were derived
   from the obtained single-crystal elastic constants. The ductility
   mechanism for the studied compounds is discussed via the elastic
   constants C-ij. Our calculations with the GGA approximation predict that
   CoMnCrGe, CoMnCrAl, CoMnCrSi and CoMnCrAs are half-metallic ferrimagnets
   (HMFs) with a half-metallic gap E-HM of 0.03 eV, 0.19 eV, 0.34 eV and
   0.50 eV for, respectively. We also find that the half-metallicity is
   maintained on a wide range of lattice constants.}},

Pages = {{405-418}},
Abstract = {{We consider negative binomial (NB) regression models for RNA-Seq read
   counts and investigate an approach where such NB regression models are
   fitted to individual genes separately and, in particular, the NB
   dispersion parameter is estimated from each gene separately without
   assuming commonalities between genes. This single-gene approach
   contrasts with the more widely-used dispersion-modeling approach where
   the NB dispersion is modeled as a simple function of the mean or other
   measures of read abundance, and then estimated from a large number of
   genes combined. We show that through the use of higher-order asymptotic
   techniques, inferences with correct type I errors can be made about the
   regression coefficients in a single-gene NB regression model even when
   the dispersion is unknown and the sample size is small. The motivations
   for studying single-gene models include: 1) they provide a basis of
   reference for understanding and quantifying the power-robustness
   trade-offs of the dispersion-modeling approach; 2) they can also be
   potentially useful in practice if moderate sample sizes become available
   and diagnostic tools indicate potential problems with simple models of
   dispersion.}},

Abstract = {{The argillaceous slate obviously shows softening characteristics under
   water-rock interaction. The relationship between the uniaxial
   compressive strength (UCS), elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio and water
   absorption time in the softening process of argillaceous slate is
   analyzed by conducting uniaxial compression tests. The laws of pore
   generation, expansion and breakthrough in the softening process under
   water-rock interaction are studied by using the nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR). The relationship between porosity and water absorption
   time in the softening process is analyzed. The evolution rule of
   microstructure in the softening process of argillaceous slate under
   water-rock interaction is analyzed by the scanning electron microscope
   (SEM). Based on the fractal theory, the change rule of the fractal
   dimension under different soaking time is studied. The fractal dimension
   value of pore microstructure, porosity, UCS and elastic modulus are
   selected as the changes of describing the interaction system of
   argillaceous slate and water solution by using the nonlinear dynamics
   theory. The applicability of the model is verified with experimental
   data. The results show that UCS and elastic modulus decrease with the
   increase of water absorption time, showing a negative linear
   correlation, but there is no obvious relationship between the Poisson's
   ratio and water absorption time. At the early stage of immersion, the
   water-rock interaction is strong, and the micropores in the slate expand
   and penetrate to form larger pores, and the porosity increases rapidly.
   With the increase of water absorption time, the pores in the
   argillaceous slate are connected with each other to form large pores,
   which leads to the complex network structure. The fractal dimension of
   argillaceous slate increases logarithmically and tends to be stable
   gradually. The results calculated by the nonlinear model are close to
   the experimental data, which shows that the softening process of
   argillaceous slate has the obvious nonlinear dynamic characteristics,
   and the softening law of argillaceous slate under water-rock interaction
   can be better characterized by the nonlinear dynamic model. The results
   can provide a reference for the theoretical study of soft rock-water
   interaction.}},

   high-strength honeycomb cores of triangular isogrid geometry with
   impressive results in all constitutive parameters both in-plane and
   out-of-plane. In this paper the application of the DIRIS technology on
   creating high-strength auxetic triangular cores is presented. The
   mechanical behaviour of the resulting core and panel was numerically
   investigated using FEA and testing on manufactured prototypes confirmed
   the high strength of the proposed design. In fact the shear modulus of
   the DIRIS auxetic cores was found superior to that of existing
   mass-produced honeycomb cores despite the inherent complexity of the
   geometrical configuration and the non-standardized manufacturing method.

Abstract = {{In order to improve the crashworthiness and energy absorption
   performance, this paper introduces the structural bionics to the
   structural design of crash box and proposes a novel structure. Taking
   the human tibia as a bionic object, the novel crash box is composed of a
   concave structure shell and an inner core filled with negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) structure material. In view of the gradient characteristics
   of the cancellous bone structure of the tibia, the NPR inner core is
   designed as a functional gradient distribution structure along the
   longitudinal direction of the crash box. Based on this, by combining the
   optimal Latin hypercube design and response surface methodology, a
   multi-objective optimization design is conducted for the novel crash box
   based on archive-based micro genetic algorithm (AMGA) and improved
   non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). Simulation results
   show that the novel crash box optimized by NSGA-II algorithm can improve
   the energy absorption characteristics and comprehensive crashworthiness
   more effectively, and make the collision process controllable and
   stable. The results of this paper can provide some reference for the
   design and optimization of the crash box. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The principle of local thermodynamic equilibrium is systematically
   employed for obtaining various transport properties of long straight
   nano-channels. The concept of virtual solution is used to describe
   situations of non-negligible overlap of diffuse parts of electric double
   layers (EDLs) in nano-channels. Generic expressions for a variety of
   transport properties of long straight nano-channels are obtained in
   terms of quasi-equilibrium distribution coefficients of ions and
   functionals of quasi-equilibrium distribution of electrostatic
   potential. Further, the Poisson-Boltzmann approach is used to specify
   these expressions for long straight slit-like nano-channels. In the
   approximation of non-overlapped diffuse parts of double electric layers
   in nano-channels, simple analytical expressions are obtained for the
   apparent electrophoretic mobilities of (trace) analytes of arbitrary
   charge as well as for the salt reflection coefficient (osmotic
   pressure), salt diffusion permeability and electro-viscosity
   (electrokinetic energy conversion). The approximate solutions are
   compared with the results of rigorous solution of non-linearized
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation, and the accuracy of approximation is shown
   to be typically excellent when the nano-channel half-height exceeds ca.3
   Debye screening lengths. Due to non-negligible electrostatic adsorption
   of ions by nano-channels, the apparent electrophoretic mobilities of
   counter-ionic analytes in nano-channels are smaller than in

   dependence on the charge is useful for the separation of analytes of
   close electrophoretic mobilities.
   The osmotic pressure is shown to be positive, negative or pass through
   maxima as a function of applied salt-concentration difference within a
   fairly narrow range of ratios of nano-channel height to the Debye
   screening length. The diffusion permeability of charged nano-channels to
   single salts is demonstrated (for the first time) to be typically larger
   than that of neutral nano-channels of the same dimensions due to
   electrical facilitation of salt diffusion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{39}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Two novel chiral block lattice topologies are here conceived having
   interesting auxetic and acoustic behavior. The architectured chiral
   material is made up of a periodic repetition of square or hexagonal
   rigid and heavy blocks connected by linear elastic interfaces, whose
   chirality results from an equal rotation of the blocks with respect to
   the line connecting their centroids. The governing equation of the
   Lagrangian model is derived and a hermitian eigenproblem is formulated
   to obtain the frequency band structure. An equivalent micropolar
   continuum is analytically derived through a standard continualization
   approach in agreement with the procedure proposed by Bacigalupo and
   Gambarotta (2017) from which an approximation of the frequency spectrum
   is obtained. Moreover, the overall elastic moduli of the equivalent
   Cauchy continuum are obtained in closed form via a proper condensation
   procedure. The parametric analysis involving the overall elastic moduli
   of the Cauchy equivalent continuum model and the frequency band
   structure is carried out to catch the influence of the chirality angle
   and of the ratio between the tangential and normal stiffness of the
   interface. Finally, it is shown how chirality and interface stiffness
   may affect strong auxeticity and how the equivalent micropolar model
   provides dispersion curves in excellent agreement with the current ones
   for a wide range of the wave vector magnitude. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Based on the capillary tension theory and microstructure pore of
   concrete, a prediction method of early autogenous shrinkage of
   self-consolidating concrete (SCC) was established. Self-consolidating
   concrete (SCC) specimens with different strength grades were prepared.
   The physical and mechanical properties (autogenous shrinkage, Poisson's
   ratio, modulus of elasticity and compressive strength) of SCC with
   different strength grades were tested at the age of 3,7, and 28 days.
   The 3,7 and 28 days pore distribution of capillary pores of SCC with
   different strength grades were also tested. Negative pressure of
   capillary and autogenous shrinkage were determined by means of capillary
   tension theory. Finally, based on the calculation results, a prediction
   method of early autogenous shrinkage of SCC was established. The results
   show that predicted values derived from this model matched very well

   earth-transition metal borides and carbides (RT(x)Z, R=Sc, Y, and La,
   T=Pt and Pd, Z=B and C, and x=2, 3, and 4) compounds were studied.
   Results show that RT(3)Z compounds with tetragonal P4mm structure are
   energetically more favorable than usually cubic perovskite-type
   structure. Furthermore, RT(3)Z with perovskite structure is found to be
   mechanically unstable with the negative C-44. Formation enthalpy
   calculations indicate that Pt-based borides are easier to be synthesized
   compared with Pd-based ones and counterpart carbides, respectively.
   Elastic constants, bulk moduli, shear moduli, Young's moduli, and
   Poisson's ratio of studied compounds have been calculated. Also, all the
   studied compounds show ductile behavior. Moreover, total and partial
   density of states (DOSS) and bonding charge density were employed to
   elucidate the bonding features of these compounds. The results reveal
   that the covalency between Pt-5d and Z-2p as well as T-nd (n=4 for Pd
   and 5 for Pt) and B-2p states, are the cause of the relatively higher
   elastic moduli of Pt-based compounds and R-T-borides, respectively. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS OF THE EARTH}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{The temperature variations of normal mode frequencies of a specimen of
   alpha-quartz single-crystal have been measured nearly up to the
   alpha-beta transition (T-0 = 573 degrees C), and all of the independent
   elastic constants were determined simultaneously by the rectangular
   parallelepiped resonance method. The results demonstrate that bulk
   moduli decrease largely toward T-0, while shear moduli show only a
   slight decrease. The trigonal constant C-14 decreases just below T-0,
   but seems to remain a finite value even at T-0. It is noted that the
   isotropic aggregate of alpha-quartz is a curious and scarce material in
   the sense that its bulk modulus is smaller than the shear modulus, and
   Poisson's ratio is very small or even negative at temperatures higher
   than 450 degrees C. In the measured temperature variations of mode
   frequencies, a characteristic feature was observed when two branches of
   A(g) modes came close, suggesting mode coupling. Except for this
   coupling between A(g) modes themselves, no definite evidence was
   observed which was indicative of coupling between modes of different
   symmetry. So it can be said the present sample is uniform in its
   property enough to suppress the coupling between modes of different
   symmetry.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an autoregressive random coefficient model with

   time effects, (c) multiple event categories, and (d) autodependencies.
   The last component is based on a stochastic integer-valued
   autoregressive process proposed by McKenzie. The model is applied to
   analyze count data from a panel diary study about the relationship
   between personality factors and emotion experiences. It is shown that
   there are large and stable individual personality differences in the
   incidence and duration of self-reported emotional experiences.
   Theoretical and clinical implications of this result are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, structural stability, elastic properties, electronic
   structure and thermodynamic properties of Al-Fe-Si compounds are
   systematically investigated by first-principles calculations. The
   negative formation enthalpy indicates that all Al-Fe-Si compounds are
   thermodynamically stable, and the Al-Fe-Si compounds are determined to
   be mechanically stable by the stability criteria. The bulk, shear and
   Young's moduli as well as Poisson's ratio of Al-Fe-Si compounds are also
   calculated. The results show that Al2Fe3Si3 has the highest shear
   modulus and Young's modulus, which leads to stronger shear deformation
   resistance and stiffness. The elastic anisotropy and shear anisotropic
   factors of Al-Fe-Si compounds are analyzed in this study, and the
   anisotropy of Al3Fe2Si3 is the greatest among them. Al3Fe2Si3 and
   Al2Fe3Si4 show metallic character and Al2Fe3Si3 is classified as direct
   band gap semiconductors. The DOS of Al-Fe-Si compounds are found mainly
   from Al 3p, Si 3p and Fe 4d states and the Fe-Al/Si bonding is much
   stronger than that of Al-Si. According to the results, Al2Fe3Si3 has the
   highest Debye temperature, indicating strong chemical bonding and higher
   thermal conductivity, which are consistent with the results of Young's
   modulus and minimum thermal conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of pristine and fully hydrogenated 2D hexagonal
   GeC monolayer were investigated by density functional theory
   calculations. Fully hydrogenated means that there is a hydrogen atom
   connected to each Ge and C atoms. Formation energy of fully hydrogenated
   GeC was negative which indicates that hydrogenated GeC is energetically
   stable. Uniaxial and biaxial strains were applied to the pristine and
   hydrogenated GeC in harmonic elastic deformation range and in-plane
   stiffness and Poisson's ratio were calculated by fitting the resulted
   strained energy to the strain-energy formula. Calculated in-plane
   stiffness and Poisson's ratio of hydrogenated GeC were respectively
   about 50\% and 30\% lower than those of pristine GeC. Pristine and
   hydrogenated GeCs are semiconductor and the band gap of hydrogenated GeC
   is larger than pristine. By Mulliken charge analysis we found that, in
   hydrogenated GeC, charge transfers from H atoms to GeC sheet.}},

Pages = {{87-95}},

Abstract = {{Under compression, auxetic open cell cellular solids may lose auxeticity
   due to instability and/or self-contact between the ribs. This study
   explores the limiting strains for preserving auxetic effects for auxetic
   open cell materials of two different cellular structures: re-entrant
   honeycomb and the `missing-rib' type chiral cellular solids. Experiments
   of the 3D printed specimens, periodicity analysis, and ellipticity
   analysis showed that, under compressive loads, the auxetic effects and
   the limiting compressive strain for auxeticity are mutually exclusive.
   In other words, the limiting compressive strain has to be reduced if
   larger auxetic effect is desired, vice versa. It was found that compared
   with re-entrant honeycombs, due to chirality-induced rotation, the
   chiral cellular solids can preserve auxetic effects under much larger
   compressive strain (>-10-30\%). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{854}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{In present study, the negative chemical pressure effect on SrMoO3
   molybdate system has been demonstrated with the help of substitution
   based strategy employing density functional theory (DFT) for the first
   time. We have observed that it is possible to tune band structure (BS)
   in a controlled manner by introducing higher ionic Barium (Ba) to the
   lower ionic Strontium (Sr) site by controlling doping content. We have
   noticed an interesting correlation among BS, covalency strength and
   negative chemical pressure. Equally important, elastic, mechanical and
   direction dependency of our system also can be correlated with negative
   chemical pressure and can be tuned effectively with doping amount. It
   can be noticed that the anisotropy of our system under study is
   significantly dependent on elastic constant C-11 and prominent
   anisotropy can be observed in the Poisson ratio than the Shear modulus
   in all the cases. We have predicted an effective way of describing the
   phase and compression of a disordered system using elastic constant
   employing the theoretical and graphical (2D and 3D) anisotropy
   measurement techniques which can be a guidance for future research using
   DFT. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a thin tube formulation for coupled
   extension-torsion-inflation deformation in helically reinforced
   pressurized circular tubes. Both compressible and incompressible tubes
   are considered. On applying the thin tube limit, the nonlinear ordinary
   differential equation to obtain the in-plane radial displacement is
   converted into a set of two simple algebraic equations for the
   compressible case and one equation for the incompressible case. This
   allows us to obtain analytical expressions, in terms of the tube's
   intrinsic twist, material constants, and the applied pressure, which can
   predict whether such tubes would overwind/unwind on being
   infinitesimally stretched or exhibit positive/negative Poisson's effect.
   We further show numerically that such tubes can be tuned to generate
   initial overwinding followed by rapid unwinding as observed during
   finite stretching of a torsionally relaxed DNA. Finally, we demonstrate
   that such tubes can also exhibit usual deflation initially followed by
   unusual inflation as the tube is finitely stretched.}},

Abstract = {{Meta-sandwich composites with three-dimensional (3D) printed
   architecture structure are characterized by their high ability to absorb
   energy. In this paper, static and fatigue 3-point bending tests are
   implemented on a 3D printed sandwich composites with a re-entrant
   honeycomb core. The skins, core and whole sandwich are manufactured
   using the same bio-based material which is polylactic acid with flax
   fiber reinforcement. Experimental tests are performed in order to
   evaluate the durability and the ability of this material to dissipate
   energy. First, static tests are conducted to study the bending behaviour
   of the sandwich beams, as well as to determine the failure parameters
   and the characteristic used in fatigue tests. Then, fatigue analyses
   were carried out to determine the fatigue resistance of these
   structures. The effects of the core density on the stiffness, hysteresis
   loop, energy absorption and loss factor, for two loading level, are
   determined. Moreover, the behaviour of this sandwich composite with
   re-entrant honeycomb core is compared with that of sandwiches with
   different core topologies. The results show that sandwich with high core
   density dissipate more energy, which results higher loss factors. The
   determined properties offer the most sensitive indicators of sandwich
   composite damage during its lifetime. This work aims to determine the
   static and fatigue properties of this material, thus, study its
   potential applications in industry.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we described the characteristics of negative group
   velocities of Lamb-type waves in a glass/water/glass structure
   controlled by the thickness of the water layer. Lamb waves in an elastic
   plate have negative group velocities. It is known that the range of
   existence of negative group velocities depends on the Poisson's ratio of
   the elastic plate. However, in the case of Lamb waves, their negative
   group velocities depend on the physical parameters of each material;
   therefore, we fabricated a structure such that the negative group
   velocities of Lamb waves are controllable without the limitation of the
   parameters of each material. The waves in such a structure are referred
   to as the Lamb-type waves. Using numerical calculations, we determined
   that the negative group velocities of the Lamb-type waves can be varied
   by changing the geometric parameters, and the negative group velocities
   are changed although the frequencies are fixed. Additionally, we found
   that the Lamb-type waves have various characteristics corresponding to
   the propagation modes.}},

Abstract = {{SmS becomes intermediate valent at an applied pressure of about 6.5
   kbar. On the other hand, SmS doped with La or Tm is already intermediate
   valent at normal pressure and room temperature. The doping atoms
   (depending on their concentration) create new occupied states in the SmS
   gap which lead to the typical hybridised 4f(i)/4f(i-1)-5d(1)-states. The
   La-cation is always trivalent in LaS, whereas the Tm-cation has a
   valence between 2 and 3. Therefore, we expect to see a difference in the
   intermediate valent behaviour. A strong evidence of intermediate valence
   is a negative C-12 and a negative Poisson's ratio. Using high-resolution
   Brillouin-spectroscopy we measured the phase velocity of the surface
   acoustic waves in the (100)-plane of Sm1-xLaxS and Sm1-xTmxS. Applying a
   standard fit-algorithm we calculated all three elastic constants (C-11,
   C-12 and C-44) from the angular dispersion relation. To get more
   reliable results the compression-moduli also have been determined and
   linked to the elastic constants C-11 and C-12 in the fit model.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral metamaterials are widely studied for their unique mechanical
   properties, but still have problems such as low stiffness and few
   available scenarios. Based on the tetra-chiral metamaterial, a type of
   metamaterial with programmable stiffness and multistability is designed
   in this paper. The stiffness of two-dimensional (2D) metamaterial can be
   adjusted programmatically by changing its geometric parameters. The
   equivalent elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio were obtained by using an
   analytical solution and finite element method. Then the 2D metamaterials
   were extended to cylindrical tubes with multistability. The deformation
   patterns of the 2D metamaterials and cylindrical tubes with different
   geometric parameters were investigated. It is found that the cylindrical
   tubes can exhibit compression-torsion coupling and multistability
   deformation characteristics. This work can provide a valuable reference
   for designs of novel metamaterials with coupled deformation, as well as
   further expanding the field of application.}},

Abstract = {{Standard Poisson and negative binomial truncated regression models for
   count data include the regressors in the mean of the non-truncated
   distribution. In this paper, a new approach is proposed so that the
   explanatory variables determine directly the truncated mean. The main
   advantage is that the regression coefficients in the new models have a
   straightforward interpretation as the effect of a change in a covariate
   on the mean of the response variable. A simulation study has been
   carried out in order to analyze the performance of the proposed
   truncated regression models versus the standard ones showing that
   coefficient estimates are now more accurate in the sense that the
   standard errors are always lower. Also, the simulation study indicates
   that the estimates obtained with the standard models are biased. An
   application to real data illustrates the utility of the introduced
   truncated models in a hurdle model. Although in the example there are
   slight differences in the results between the two approaches, the
   proposed one provides a clear interpretation of the coefficient
   estimates.}},

Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{138-149}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The deformation and impact energy absorption properties of ultrathin
   polymeric microlattices were investigated as a function of density, size
   and positional eccentricity of the trusses, which controlled the amount
   of bending in the microlattice deformations. We considered highly
   porous, 3-D microstructures with small lattice constants (<= 135 mu m),
   and studied their response to high strain rate (similar to 1000/s)
   tests, using high speed video capture, SEM imaging and quantitative
   modelling. The microlattices were found to have excellent impact
   absorption efficiencies that are 2 - 120 times better than carbon
   nanotube foams, polycarbonate and silicone rubber, despite being an
   order of magnitude slimmer than the thinnest commercial foams of similar
   densities. This high impact absorption efficiency is largely due to the
   sideways buckling of the microlattice trusses during the crushing stage,
   which prevented densification of the microlattices at small strains.
   Furthermore, we showed that varying the positional eccentricity of the
   trusses and the number of unit cells in the microlattices can modulate
   their stiffness, strength and energy absorption over an appreciable
   range, comparable to that obtained through modifications in relative
   density. Because the microlattices were mostly under stress equilibrium
   during the impact process, the insights derived from the present study
   are expected to be valid for quasistatic and low strain rate loadings as
   well.}},

Abstract = {{The structural, electronic, elastic, phonon, and thermodynamic
   properties of the cubic perovskite structure of the NaWO3 compound were
   calculated from first-principles studies based on density functional
   theory (DFT). These properties were computed within localized density
   approximation (LDA). The lattice constant (a) and bulk modulus (B) for
   NaWO3 are found as 3.857 angstrom, 225.314 GPa, respectively. The band
   structure displayed that the NaWO3 compound exhibits metallic behavior
   at zero pressure. For elastic properties, elastic constants (C-ij),
   isotropic shear modulus (G), Young's modulus (Y), Poisson's ratio (v),
   and anisotropy factor (A) were studied. At zero pressure, the calculated
   C-11, C-12, and C-44 are 558.933, 88.681, and 66.245 GPa, respectively.
   According to the results, NaWO3 is mechanically stable. A is not equal
   to 1. This reveals that NaWO3 is an anisotropic compound. Because of the
   Cauchy pressure and B/G ratio, NaWO3 behaves ductilely. The shear
   constants (C-12 and C-44) are less sensitive to pressure than C-11 which
   indicates little resistance to shear deformation. The negative phonon
   frequencies were observed in phonon dispersion curves. Therefore, NaWO3
   is dynamically unstable. Finally, heat capacity (C-V), entropy (S), and
   Helmholtz-free energy (F) were also calculated and discussed at 0-1000
   K. Consequently, NaWO3 is a potential candidate for future new device
   designs.}},

Abstract = {{Inter-tube bridging of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a reliable way to
   improve the inter-tube stress transfer abilities. The work describes the
   interfacial interactions provided by a wall-to-wall inter-tube bridging
   between two single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) embedded in a
   polyethylene (PE) matrix. Molecular dynamics (MD) models of tube pullout
   phenomena represent by the embedding (10, 10)-(10, 10) SWCNT with
   interconnections into an amorphous PE matrix. The simulations show that
   the inter-tube bridging enhances the pullout energies significantly due
   to the three energy dissipative micro-mechanisms: stress-induced tube
   deformation with localized auxetic effect, ``cutting through{''}
   (penetration) between linker and matrix, and the accompanying tube
   pullout. Moreover, the results also predict that linkers with longer
   aliphatic chains or aromatic rings provide further increase to the
   levels of the nanotube pullout energies. These are of potential
   importance in guiding the design of CNT/polymer composites through
   inter-tube linkage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When a force deforms an elastic object, practical experience suggests
   that the resulting displacement will be in the same direction as the
   force. This property is known as positive stiffness'. Less familiar is
   the concept of negative stiffness, where the deforming force and the
   resulting displacement are in opposite directions. (Negative stiffness
   is distinct from negative Poisson's ratio(2-6), which refers to the
   occurrence of lateral expansion upon stretching an object.) Negative
   stiffness can occur, for example, when the deforming object has
   stored(7) (or is supplied(8) with) energy. This property is usually
   unstable, but it has been shown theoretically(9) that inclusions of
   negative stiffness can be stabilized within a positive-stiffness matrix.
   Here we describe the experimental realization of this composite approach
   by embedding negative-stiffness inclusions of ferroelastic vanadium
   dioxide in a pure tin matrix. The resulting composites exhibit extreme
   mechanical damping and large anomalies in stiffness, as a consequence of
   the high local strains that result from the inclusions deforming more
   than the composite as a whole. Moreover, for certain temperature ranges,
   the negative-stiffness inclusions are more effective than diamond
   inclusions for increasing the overall composite stiffness. We expect
   that such composites could be useful as high damping materials, as stiff
   structural elements or for actuator-type applications.}},

Abstract = {{The modeling of the mechanisms of generation, loss, multiplication and
   transport of charge carriers is vital for the simulation of the
   prebreakdown process in dielectric liquids. Unfortunately, there is a
   lack of suitable coefficients to describe the electron generation and
   transport of carriers in liquids, which hinders the development of
   numerical models with sufficient predictive power. In this paper, the
   drift-dominated continuity equations for electrons and ions are coupled
   with Poisson's equation in order to simulate the carrier production and
   drift in the liquid phase under positive and negative voltages in
   cyclohexane. The estimations of the model are compared with measurements
   of current-voltage characteristics and Trichel current pulses reported
   in the literature for needle-plane configurations. In the analysis, the
   electron generation mechanisms suggested for dielectric liquids are
   analyzed and discussed. It is found that estimations based on the Zener
   equation for field-dependent molecular ionization do not agree with
   measurements for negative sharp points. It is also shown that the proper
   estimation of the electric current in the liquid phase should consider a
   field-dependent attachment term as well as the electrohydrodynamic
   movement of the liquid.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Binomial Distribution (NBD) has been widely employed in
   marketing to model purchase incidence. In this paper, we undertake a
   simulation study to examine the sensitivity of NBD when the number of
   purchases in a given period is Poisson or Erlang 2 but the underlying
   heterogeneity is different from gamma. In particular, we allow the
   heterogeneity to follow three other flexible and well-known
   distributions: inverse Gaussian, lognormal and Weibull. All these
   distributions have shapes that are similar to the gamma. Moreover, we
   evaluate the performance of three alternative models namely, the
   Condensed Negative Binomial (CNBD), the Generalized Negative Binomial
   (GNBD) and the Generalized Poisson (GPD).
   Our simulation results indicate that NBD is robust to the violation of
   gamma heterogeneity when the interpurchase time is exponential and the
   coefficient of variation of the heterogeneity distribution is either low
   or moderate. CNBD exhibits similar robustness when the interpurchase
   time is Erlang 2. However, when the coefficient of variation exceeds
   one, all models exhibit extreme sensitivity to variations in the
   heterogeneity distribution for both interpurchase times. Interestingly,
   NBD and CNBD do not appear to be good substitutes for each other. GNBD
   and GPD models are possible alternatives to the NBD model.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the mechanical in-plane and thermal conductivity

   The hexagonal-rectangular honeycomb proposed allows one more geometric

   configurations. The added geometric entity provides enhanced in-plane
   flexibility and tailoring of properties, such as the in-plane Poisson's
   ratio, which can become negative under specific geometry configurations.
   The thermal conductivities are modeled using the electric-thermal
   analogy, allowing closed-form solutions for the thermal properties of
   the honeycomb. Comparison between analytical models and finite element

   modulus of elasticity), and had lower drying shrinkage and higher
   resistance to chloride ion penetration. The negative side reveals that
   the workability, compressive strength and tensile splitting strength of

Abstract = {{The paper presents a Bezier triangle based isogeometric shape
   optimization method. Bezier triangles are used to represent both the
   geometry and physical fields. For a given physical domain defined by
   B-spline boundary, a coarse Bezier triangular parameterization is
   automatically generated. This coarse mesh is used to maintain
   parameterization quality and move mesh by solving a pseudo linear
   elasticity problem. Then a fine mesh for isogeometric analysis is
   generated from the coarse mesh through degree elevation and refinement.
   As the fine mesh retains the same geometric map as the coarse mesh, we
   can guarantee mesh validity with the coarse mesh only. This bi-level
   mesh allows us to achieve high numerical accuracy of isogeometric
   analysis and lower computational cost on mesh validity control and mesh
   movement. Due to the use of B-spline boundary, the optimized shape can
   be compactly represented with a relatively small number of optimization
   variables. Due to the use Bezier triangles, this shape optimization
   method is applicable to structures of complex topology and allows for
   local refinement for analysis. By representing the squared distance
   between two Bezier curves as a Bezier form, a distance check scheme is
   also introduced to prevent intersections of design boundaries and
   control the thickness of structural connections. Numerical examples on
   minimal compliance design and design of negative Poisson ratios are
   presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{We systematically investigate the phase stability, martensitic
   transformation (MT) behavior and mechanical properties of Ni or Ti doped
   B2 CuZr phase with the supercell and virtual crystal approximation (VCA)
   methods. Formation energies of different supercells are used to judge
   the preference site of the dopants and to study the alloying effects on
   the stability of CuZr phase. By analyzing the alloying effects on two
   cubic elastic moduli (C' and C-44), we make a prediction of the
   composition-dependent martensitic transformation start temperature (Ms),
   which may give a theoretical interpretation of the different
   experimental observations for the Ni doped CuZr alloys and may also
   explain the effects of Ti on the decreasement of Ms from Ti's
   destabilizing-effect induced decomposition of CuZr alloys. In addition,
   with the calculated elastic constants, mechanical properties including
   ductility and negative Poisson's ratio (PR) of the Ni or Ti doped CuZr
   alloys are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate the effects of two scaling exponents on
   the biaxial deformation and mass transport of swollen elastomers. Two
   scaling exponents are included in an extended version of the Flory
   Rehner model (Okumura et al., J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 2016); two scaling
   exponents are used to adjust the swelling effects on the Young's modulus
   and osmotic pressure of swollen elastomers, resulting in the ability to
   predict swelling induced strain softening under uniaxial tensile
   loading. It is found that when biaxial tensile loading is given under
   stress control, strain softening is accelerated by increasing the
   biaxial stress ratio, while under strain control, the responses become
   more complicated, which can be interpreted by considering that Poisson's
   ratio at equilibrium free swelling can take negative values depending on
   the two scaling exponents. Further, the effect of the two scaling
   exponents on mass transport is discussed by analyzing the swelling
   kinetics of a gel layer constrained on a rigid substrate. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{In order to calculate the reliability index of a circular tunnel
   excavated in a soil mass, the first-order reliability method (FORM) is
   used. A 2D numerical model in a transversal section and a serviceability
   limit state (SLS) is considered in this analysis. This work focuses on
   the tunnel lining bending moment and surface settlement trough. Only the
   soil parameters are considered as random variables. The response surface
   methodology is utilized for the assessment of the Hasofer-Lind
   reliability index beta(HL) and is optimized by the use of a genetic
   algorithm. Two assumptions (normal distribution or non-normal) were used
   for the random variables. The comparison between analysis using
   negatively correlated and uncorrelated variables (Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio) indicates that the results are conservative if a
   negative correlation is considered among the elastic parameters. The
   assumption of non-normal distribution for the random variables has an
   effect on the reliability index of the surface settlements and lining
   bending moments.}},

Abstract = {{The structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of typical
   iron-containing phases, Al3Fe, Al6Fe, and Al7Cu2Fe, in Al-Cu alloys were
   determined using first-principles calculations. The calculated lattice
   constants were in good agreement with experimental values. Al3Fe
   exhibited the highest structural stability and most superior alloying
   ability. Al6Fe had the worst alloying ability and required a high
   cooling rate for its formation during solidification. Al7Cu2Fe was the
   easiest to dissolve into the Al matrix because it has the lowest
   negative cohesion energy. Mechanical properties improved with increasing
   pressure. Al3Fe exhibited the highest stiffness and strongest resistance
   to volume change and shear deformation. Al6Fe had better ductility owing
   to the high bulk-to-shear modulus ratio and Poisson's ratio; however, it
   had the lowest hardness and highest anisotropy, leading to a strong
   tendency for crack initiation. Density of states data showed that no
   structural variation or phase transformation occurs for any of the
   phases under applied pressure; moreover, they indicated covalent bonding
   in Al3Fe, accounting for the relatively high structural stability.
   Finally, all iron-containing phases were confirmed to be paramagnetic.}},

   crystalline systems using force-field based simulations. It is shown
   that, in-plane, these systems behave rather similarly to crystalline
   forms of graphyne, graphdiyne, and other fully substituted equivalents
   but benefit from the presence of larger pores which makes them less
   stiff and may enable them to be used in a wider range of applications
   such as nanofiltration. It is also shown that at large strains these
   systems have the potential to exhibit auxetic out-of-plane behaviour, a
   property which can be manifested in other triangulated systems and can
   be explained from buckling of some nanoribs in the systems.}},

Abstract = {{Fiducial quantities are proposed to construct approximate tolerance
   limits and intervals for functions of some discrete random variables.
   Using established fiducial quantities for binomial proportions, Poisson
   rates, and negative binomial proportions, an approach is demonstrated to
   handle functions of discrete random variables, whose distributions are
   either not available or are intractable. The construction of tolerance
   intervals using fiducial quantities is straightforward and, thus,
   amenable to numerical computation. An extensive numerical study shows
   that for most settings of the cases considered, the coverage
   probabilities are near the nominal levels. The applicability of the

   discussion of the corresponding software that is available for the R

Abstract = {{First-principles calculations were performed to study structural,
   elastic and electronic properties of typical face-centered cubic (fcc)
   precipitates of Mg-based alloys (Mg3Gd, Mg3Gd0.5Y0.5 and Mg3Zn3Y2)
   within the generalized gradient approximation. The calculated results
   show that the substitution of part of the Gd with Y in Mg3Gd leads to a
   slight decrease in the cell volume (0.35\%). and the lattice parameters
   obtained after full relaxation of crystalline cells are in good
   agreement with the experimental data. The calculated negative formation
   enthalpies and the cohesive energies show that these typical fee
   precipitates of Mg-based alloys have good alloying ability and
   structural stability. According to the calculated density of states of
   these phases, it is found that the highest structural stability of
   Mg3Zn3Y2 is attributed to an increase in the bonding electron numbers
   below the Fermi level. In addition, the elastic constants C-y of these
   phases were also calculated, and the bulk modulus B. shear modulus G,
   Young's modulus E, Poisson's ratio v and anisotropy value A of
   polycrystalline materials were derived from the elastic constants. The
   mechanical properties are further discussed. (c) 2008 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{The Half Heusler alloy (HHA) MnCrP has been studied theoretically for
   structural, elasto-mechanical and phonon properties. The structure is
   optimized and the calculated structural parameters are close to the
   literature. This optimized data is used to estimate three independent
   second-order cubic elastic constants C-11, C-12 and C-44. The mechanical
   stability criteria are explored by these constants and further used to
   estimate the elastic moduli; Young's, bulk and shear modulus. The
   mechanical parameters like Poisson's ratio, Pugh's ratio, anisotropic
   factor, Cauchy pressure, shear constant, Lame's constants, Kleinman
   parameter are also calculated and discussed. Discussions reveal the
   ductile nature, ionic behavior, anisotropic nature and mechanical
   stability of MnCrP. The metallic nature, compressibility, stiffness and
   interatomic forces of material are also described. Furthermore, the
   Debye temperature, where the collective vibrations shifts to an
   independent thermal vibrations, is also calculated. Longitudinal and
   transverse sound velocities are also obtained to investigate the phonon
   modes of oscillation. These phonon modes confirm the stability of the
   alloy as no negative phonon frequencies in the phonon-dispersion curves.
   These curves are used to estimate the reststrahlen band where light
   reflects 100\% and the suitability of material is checked for Far
   Infrared (FIR), photographic, optoelectronic devices and sensors.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a visual model for analyzing the vibration modes of
   piano soundboards by combining the tools of finite element analysis and
   computer-aided design. Based on the predicted results from the model,
   changes of natural frequency and maximum displacement of the soundboard

   discussed. Wood grain direction affected the mode shape of the
   soundboard. Among the 10 property factors investigated, density
   presented the greatest impact to the vibration mode of the soundboard
   followed by Young's modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio.
   Increasing the thickness of the resonance board and the use of ribs had
   positive impacts on the natural frequency of the soundboard. However,
   the amount of natural frequency was decreased for those that were lower
   than 100 Hz. Natural frequency increased as the intensity, density, and
   size of ribs increased. Rib height had a greater effect on the variation
   of natural frequency than the intensity, density, and rib width. In
   general, increases in rib intensity, density of wood species, and rib
   width presented negative effects on the maximum displacement.}},

Abstract = {{First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT)
   have been performed to explore the effects of Si, Cr, W, and Nb elements
   on the stability, mechanical properties, and electronic structures of
   MoAlB ternary boride. The five crystals, with the formulas of Mo4Al4B4,
   Mo4Al3SiB4, Mo3CrAl4B4, Mo3WAl4B4, and Mo3NbAl4B4, have been
   respectively established. All the calculated crystals are
   thermodynamically stable, according to the negative cohesive energy and
   formation enthalpy. By the calculation of elastic constants, the
   mechanical moduli and ductility evolutions of MoAlB with elemental
   doping can be further estimated, with the aid of B/G and Poisson's
   ratios. Si and W doping cannot only enhance the Young's modulus of
   MoAlB, but also improve the ductility to some degree. Simultaneously,
   the elastic moduli of MoAlB are supposed to become more isotropic after
   Si and W addition. However, Cr and Nb doping plays a negative role in
   ameliorating the mechanical properties. Through the analysis of
   electronic structures and chemical bonding, the evolutions of chemical
   bondings can be disclosed with the addition of dopant. The enhancement
   of B-B, Al/Si-B, and Al/Si-Mo bondings takes place after Si
   substitution, and W addition apparently intensifies the bonding with B
   and Al. In this case, the strengthening of chemical bonding after Si and
   W doping exactly accounts for the improvement of mechanical properties
   of MoAlB. Additionally, Si doping can also improve the Debye temperature
   and melting point of the MoAlB crystal. Overall, Si element is predicted
   to be the optimized dopant to ameliorate the mechanical properties of
   MoAlB.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate stochastic comparisons between exponential family
   distributions and their mixtures with respect to the usual stochastic
   order, the hazard rate order, the reversed hazard rate order, and the
   likelihood ratio order. A general theorem based on the notion of
   relative log-concavity is shown to unify various specific results for
   the Poisson, binomial, negative binomial, and garmma distributions in
   recent literature. By expressing a convolution of gamma distributions
   with arbitrary scale and shape parameters as a scale mixture of gamma

Abstract = {{The influence of temperature and Freeze-Thaw (FT) processes on the

   laboratory in order to give a better understanding of changes in

   dependence of compressional and shear wave velocity of frozen soils on
   temperature, soil type and FT cycles. Compressional wave velocity showed
   a strong correlation to the unfrozen water content dependent on soil
   type, while shear wave velocity was mainly influenced by the ice content
   and the soil matrix. Compressional and shear wave velocity changed for
   samples subject to FT cycling, which appears to be caused by alterations
   in the soil structure. Elastic constants were calculated based on the
   wave propagation theory and compared to results from uniaxial
   compression tests. The dynamic elastic modulus, dynamic shear modulus
   and compressive strength increased with descending temperature. FT
   cycles reduced the compressive strength, and influenced the dynamic
   elastic constants. Poisson's ratios of all tested soils not subject to
   FT cycling decreased upon a change in negative temperature; while the
   opposite trend was observed for soils influenced by FT cycles.}},

Abstract = {{The transition from a Townsend discharge to a normal discharge is
   investigated using a two-dimensional numerical model and an approximate
   analysis. The numerical model is based on a fluid description of
   electron and ion transport coupled with Poisson's equation, with the
   ionization source depending on the local field strength or provided by a
   Monte Carlo simulation of the fast electrons. The model is applied to an
   argon discharge, for a product of pressure and gap length in the 1-10
   Torr cm range. The proposed analytical model provides insight into the
   major physical phenomena observed experimentally in the subnormal glow
   region: the lateral constriction of the Townsend discharge with an
   increase of the current, the negative differential resistance of the
   discharge with a hysteresis loop in the current-voltage characteristics,
   and the appearance of current oscillations and their dependence on
   parameters of the external circuit. The field distortion is responsible
   for the constriction of the Townsend discharge provided that either the
   sign of the second derivative of the ionization coefficient alpha with
   respect to the electric field strength E is positive or the secondary
   emission coefficient gamma is an increasing function of E. A simple
   analytical description of nonlocal ionization is also suggested.
   Subnormal oscillations are treated as a two-dimensional phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials have attracted great interest due their ability

   natural materials. Many promising mechanical metamaterials have been
   designed, fabricated, and tested, however, these metamaterials have not

   in demanding industrial applications that require multifunctional
   behavior. This paper details an auxetic multifunctional metamaterial
   that has been optimized to outperform conventional designs for cooling
   systems commonly used in the space, the transportation, the energy and
   the nuclear industry. Experimental tests performed to certify this
   material for use in gas turbines have shown that in comparison to
   conventional designs, the metamaterial increases structural life by
   orders of magnitude while also providing more efficient cooling and
   maintaining similar acoustic damping characteristics. This metamaterial

Abstract = {{Magnetostrictive Fe1-xGax alloys, as a new class of smart materials,
   have great potential in sensing and actuator applications. However, the
   fundamental understanding of the anisotropic elastic responses at high
   Ga concentration remains one of the most challenging problems for the
   binary alloys. Here, we apply the density functional theory and
   large-scale ab initio molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the
   effect of high Ga concentration on the elastic anisotropy of the Fe-Ga
   alloys with supercell models obtained by non-linear and non-uniform
   annealing processes. It is demonstrated that the formation of D0(3)-like
   structures has an important effect on the softness of the tetragonal
   shear modulus and a negligible influence on the rhombohedral shear
   modulus. Meanwhile, the Fe dangling bond to its nearest Ga atoms results
   in a decrease in the Young's modulus and the negative Poisson's ratio in
   the {[}1 1 0] direction. The improved Young's modulus in the {[}1 1 0]
   direction compared to that in the {[}1 0 0] direction is attributed to
   the different arrangement of the pure Fe layer and the Fe-Ga mixed layer
   along the {[}1 1 0] and {[}1 0 0] axes. Furthermore, the ductility of
   Fe1-xGax alloys is enhanced at high Ga content, playing a key role in
   the enhanced magnetostriction. (c) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{Deep mining has been paid much more attention because of the depletion
   of shallow mining resources. Traditional bolts could be invalid to
   accommodate large displacement and deformation in geomaterials.
   Consequently, alternative support and reinforcement bolts need to be
   studied and their constitutive models also need to be developed to help
   understanding for the complex stress-strain responses of rock masses
   under loadings. The effect of Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) that is
   attributed to the swelling phenomenon along the lateral direction may
   appear in metal materials under tensional loadings. Thence NPR materials
   often have an advantage over NPR ones in mechanical behavior such as
   impact resistance, anti-shearing, and energy absorbed. From the
   characteristics of NPR materials, a series of bolt and cable supports
   with the effect of NPR and constant-resistance have been recently
   developed. We here firstly introduce the structural features of NPR
   support. Then the constitutive model of NPR support is presented and its
   corresponding equation of energy equilibrium. Its basic principle
   interacted on rock masses is further discussed. Finally, NPR cables are
   employed to support the slope of an open-pit mine. The applications show
   that NPR cables can ease failure within the slope and play an important
   role in predicting and providing early warning of slope failure,
   together with a monitoring system of slope stability. (C) 2016 Published

Abstract = {{This study was based on the discrete fracture model to investigate the
   influence of fracture parameters on the solute transport in the
   fractured rocks of andesite in Lan-Yu island, Taiwan. In the simulation
   cases, the centers of fractures, fracture lengths and apertures were
   assumed to have Poisson's distribution, negative exponential
   distribution and lognormal distribution, respectively. With the above
   assumptions, constructing the discrete fracture model became
   practicable. Using the mass-balance equation with specified boundary
   conditions, the flow field in the rock was solved. Then particles were
   released under the flow field. Monte Carlo method was used assuming that
   the amount of particles was proportional to the flow rates to get the
   particle accumulated percentage breakthrough curve and to estimate the
   dispersion coefficient. On the basis of the discrete fracture model, it
   was possible to evaluate the property of dispersion behavior of andesite
   in Lan-Yu Island with flow and transport mechanism. Properties of the
   dispersion behavior such as the relation between distance and
   traveling-time (ln < r(2)> and ln < t >), anisotropic behavior, and the
   overall dispersion coefficient in a fracture network were characterized:
   the slope value of ln < r(2)> and ln < t > was 1.64 an indication of
   non-Fickian dispersion, the particles dispersion along the flow (D11)
   was bigger than that perpendicular to the flow (D22), and the dispersion
   coefficient by this study was 0.91 m comparing the value 1 m from
   Sauty's method.}},

   factorization algorithm for image analysis. This can be used in the
   context of blind source separation, where each observed image is a

   coefficients for the linear combination and the bases are unknown. In
   addition, the observed images are commonly corrupted by noise. While
   algorithms have been developed when the noise obeys Gaussian or Poisson
   statistics, here we take it to be Laplacian, which is more
   representative for other leptokurtic distributions. It is applicable for
   cases such as transform coefficient distributions and when there are
   insufficient noise sources for the Central Limit Theorem to apply. We
   formulate the problem as an L-1 minimization and solve it via linear

Abstract = {{In this work, we have characterized a cellular structure constituted by
   a new cell on which we carried out, initially, tensile and shear tests
   in order to get its in-plane mechanical properties; in the second time,
   we explored the effects that geometry will have on these mechanical
   properties by varying the geometric parameters of the cell. The
   specimens were designed by Computer Aided Designsoftware and obtained by
   rapid prototyping (laser cutting). In the quest for results, we used the
   technique of marker tracking. This optical method of correlating images
   consists in measuring the plane components of the displacement of a
   plane surface leaving some marks on the specimen. This makes it possible
   to determine the in-plane components of the transformation gradient
   tensor and to reach the plane components of the deformation tensor under
   certain assumptions (axisymmetric or isochoric transformation, small
   deformations, etc). The material of the studied structure is a
   polymethylmethacrylate, often abbreviated to PMMA. The first results
   gave a negative Poisson's ratio, announcing an auxetic behavior. The
   following results have confirmed the auxetic character of the cell and
   show great influence of the geometric parameters on the mechanical
   properties of the new structure.}},

Abstract = {{Possessing the unique properties of lower mass and higher performances,
   the structure with Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) can be widely used in
   aerospace and vehicle industry. By combing the NPR structure filled core
   and the traditional crash box, a novel NPR crash box is first proposed
   in this work to improve the performances of the crash box. The
   performances of the novel NPR crash box are fully studied by comparing
   to the traditional crash box and the aluminum foam filled crash box. A
   parameterized model of the NPR crash box, which integrates the design
   parameters of the basic NPR cell structure, is built to improve the
   analysis and optimization efficiency, the accuracy of the parameterized
   model is also verified by comparing to traditional FEM model.
   Multi-objective optimization model of the NPR crash box is established
   by combining the parameterized model, optimal Latin square design method
   and response surface model approach. Non-dominated sorting genetic
   algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is then applied to optimize the design parameters
   of the basic NPR cell structure to improve the performances of the NPR
   crash box. The results indicate that the novel NPR crash box can improve
   the performances of the crash box remarkably and the combination of
   parameterized model and multi-objective genetic algorithms optimize the
   NPR crash box efficiently. The presented new method also serves as a
   good example for other application and optimization of NPR structure.}},

Abstract = {{Recurrent events in clinical trials have typically been analysed using
   either a multiple time-to-event method or a direct approach based on the
   distribution of the number of events. An area of application for these
   methods is exacerbation data from respiratory clinical trials. The
   different approaches to the analysis and the issues involved are
   illustrated for a large trial (n = 1465) in chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD). For exacerbation rates, clinical interest
   centres on a direct comparison of rates for each treatment which favours
   the distribution-based analysis, rather than a time-to-event approach.
   Poisson regression has often been employed and has recently been
   recommended as the appropriate method of analysis for COPD exacerbations
   but the key assumptions often appear unreasonable for this analysis. By
   contrast use of a negative binomial model which corresponds to assuming
   a separate Poisson parameter for each subject offers a more appealing

Title = {{Effect of electrostatic interactions on rejection of capsular and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{448}},
Pages = {{492-500}},

Abstract = {{Hypotheses: Particle rejection from porous membranes will increase when
   particle and membrane carry like charges. The influence of charge on
   particle rejection can be modeled by first solving the Poisson-Boltzmann
   equation for the electrostatic particle-pore wall interaction energy,
   enabling one to predict the cross sectional particle concentration in a
   pore. Rejection coefficients can then be predicted by combining the
   Boltzmann factor with a hydrodynamic lag coefficient.
   Experiments: Rejection experiments were conducted with three different
   spherical colloidal silica particles, a spherical virus (PRD1) and gold
   nanorods of two different aspect ratios (ratio of length to diameter).
   Track-etched polycarbonate microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes
   having nearly parallel pores of cylindrical cross-section were used.
   Experiments were conducted under conditions where both particle and
   membrane carried a negative charge as well as under conditions where
   surface charges had minimal impact. Experiments were designed to cover a
   broad range of dimensionless particle sizes under conditions when
   convection dominated particle transport.
   Findings: Model predictions and experimental measurements demonstrate
   that particle rejection can be enhanced significantly when particle and
   pore carry like charges. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Tree Height Increment Models for National Forest Inventory Data in the
   Pacific Northwest, USA}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The United States national inventory program measures a subset of tree
   heights in each plot in the Pacific Northwest. Unmeasured tree heights
   are predicted by adding the difference between modeled tree heights at
   two measurements to the height observed at the first measurement. This
   study compared different approaches for directly modeling 10-year height
   increment of red alder (RA) and ponderosa pine (PP) in Washington and
   Oregon using national inventory data from 2001-2015. In addition to the
   current approach, five models were implemented: nonlinear exponential,
   log-transformed linear, gamma, quasi-Poisson, and zero-inflated Poisson
   models using both tree-level (e.g., height, diameter at breast height,
   and compacted crown ratio) and plot-level (e.g., basal area, elevation,
   and slope) measurements as predictor variables. To account for negative
   height increment observations in the modeling process, a constant was
   added to shift all response values to greater than zero (log-transformed
   linear and gamma models), the negative increment was set to zero
   (quasi-Poisson and zero-inflated Poisson models), or a nonlinear model,
   which allows negative observations, was used. Random plot effects were
   included to account for the hierarchical data structure of the inventory
   data. Predictive model performance was examined through
   cross-validation. Among the implemented models, the gamma model
   performed best for both species, showing the smallest root mean square
   error (RSME) of 2.61 and 1.33 m for RA and PP, respectively (current
   method: RA-3.33 m, PP-1.40 m). Among the models that did not add the
   constant to the response, the quasi-Poisson model exhibited the smallest
   RMSE of 2.74 and 1.38 m for RA and PP, respectively. Our study showed
   that the prediction of tree height increment in Oregon and Washington
   can be improved by accounting for the negative and zero height increment
   values that are present in inventory data, and by including random plot
   effects in the models.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, a fully analytical compact drain current model of
   back-gated two-dimensional (2D) negative capacitance (NC) FET including
   interface trap charges has been developed by solving Poisson's,

   interface trap charges on the electrical characteristics of the
   back-gated 2D NC-FET is investigated systematically based on the model.
   It is found that the subthreshold swing (SS) and on-off current ratio
   (I-on/I-off) are seriously degraded because of the presence of interface
   traps at 2D channel/oxide interface and 2D NC-FET with a big t(f) is
   more immune to the degradation induced by the interface traps. In
   addition, the underlying physics are elucidated by the capacitance

Abstract = {{This paper describes a self-developed MATLAB program for achieving
   complex deformation properties and accurate elastic parameters of woven
   fabrics. Using this program, the response surface analyses of
   deformation and elastic parameters were conducted to reveal the
   variation and evolution in stiffness, Poisson's ratio, and orthotropy of
   the laminated woven fabric composite under different loading/unloading
   stages, cycles, stress levels and ratios, which is a further development
   of our prior work. Results show that elastic parameters and orthotropic
   characteristics of the material vary noticeably with the
   loading/unloading stages, cycles, stress levels, and ratios. As higher
   values are required to model the remarkable warp-weft interaction and
   large negative strains, Poisson's ratios in boundary regions with a
   maximum of 1.0 (loading) or 1.5 (unloading) are outside the bounds
   normally expected for these parameters. In addition, the proposed method
   is feasible to evaluate elastic parameters for any stress state, and
   thereby provides new insights into underlying deformation mechanisms of
   woven fabric composites.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson and negative binomial regression models are fundamental
   statistical analysis tools for traffic safety evaluation. The regression
   parameter estimation could suffer from the finite sample bias when event
   frequency is low, which is commonly observed in safety research as
   crashes are rare events. In this study, we apply a bias-correction
   procedure to the parameter estimation of Poisson and NB regression
   models. We provide a general bias-correction formulation and illustrate
   the finite sample bias through a special scenario with a single binary
   explanatory variable. Several factors affecting the magnitude of bias
   are identified, including the number of crashes and the balance of the
   crash counts within strata of a categorical explanatory variable.
   Simulations are conducted to examine the properties of the
   bias-corrected coefficient estimators. The results show that the
   bias-corrected estimators generally provide less bias and smaller
   variance. The effect is especially pronounced when the crash count in
   one stratum is between 5 and 50. We apply the proposed method to a case
   study of infrastructure safety evaluation. Three scenarios were
   evaluated, all crashes collected in three years, and two hypothetical
   situations, where crash information was collected for ``half-year{''}
   and ``quarter-year{''} periods. The case-study results confirm that the
   magnitude of bias correction is larger for smaller crash counts. This
   paper demonstrates the finite sample bias associated with the small
   number of crashes and suggests bias adjustment can provide more accurate
   estimation when evaluating the impacts of crash risk factors.}},

Title = {{Electroconductive Melt Electrowritten Patches Matching the Mechanical
   Anisotropy of Human Myocardium}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Cardiac patches represent a promising strategy for the treatment of
   myocardial infarction (MI). Here, an electroconductive cardiac patch
   that conforms to the mechanics of human myocardium is fabricated. By
   melt electrospinning writing (MEW), it is possible to fabricate an
   auxetic patch that can overcome the limited range of elasticity seen in
   conventional square patch designs. The auxetic patches can accommodate
   the strains and stresses exhibited by the human myocardium during
   diastole and systole. It is shown that the geometry of the auxetic
   patches can be fine-tuned to reflect anisotropic mechanical properties.
   The anisotropic ratio of effective stiffness (E-1/E-2) of the auxetic
   patches agrees with the directionally-dependent mechanics of the heart.
   Furthermore, in situ polymerization of doped-polypyrrole (PPy) on the
   auxetic patches confers electroconductive properties close to those
   reported of human myocardium. This approach demonstrates the potential
   use of a rational design of PPy-coated patches for their use as cardiac
   patches.}},

Title = {{Effect of Two-Dimensional Re-Entrant Honeycomb Configuration on
   Elastoplastic Performance of Perforated Steel Plate}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Perforated steel plates with regularly shaped holes are already widely
   employed as steel dampers, which dissipate seismic energy through
   plastic deformation of steel. As a typical auxetic structure,
   two-dimensional (2D) re-entrant honeycomb configurations have
   characteristics of large deformation and good energy absorption.
   However, research on the effects of these configurations on the
   mechanical performance of steel is limited. This paper investigated the
   auxetic properties of perforated steel plates with re-entrant hexagon
   holes. Repetitive units are controlled by three parameters, hole ratio,
   re-entrant angle, and chamfer radius. Elastoplastic behavior and damage
   under large deformation were studied via tension tests and finite
   element (FE) analysis based on a micromechanics-based ductile fracture
   model. The effects of different parameters on mechanical properties of
   configurations were analyzed and discussed. The static performance of
   the perforated steel plates obtained in this study provides a good basis
   for its further dynamic study under large deformation.}},

Abstract = {{To establish implant longevity of hip prosthesis in orthopedics, a new
   approach was proposed to improve dramatically the wear resistance and to
   reduce the surface friction of the acetabular cup as a bearing material
   in the femoral head. To do so, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene
   (UHMWPE) and hydroxyapatite (HA) composites with four amounts of HA
   content were prepared by a sol-gel process, and the four composites were
   hot-molded to make a composite with HA gradient content. When the
   resultant UHMWPE/HA agglomerates by the sol-gel method were molded in
   the narrow temperature range of 145-153 degrees C, the (110) planes with
   highest density of atoms in the PE crystal unit were oriented
   predominantly parallel to the resultant film surface. Such an unusual
   planar orientation contributed excellent wear resistance and low
   friction on the surface. Polarized light-scattering patterns, SEM
   images, and FTIR spectra of the specimens with such unusual planar
   orientation supported that the narrow molding temperature range achieves
   good dispersion of HA particles and high crystallinity of the UHMWPE
   matrix on the surface layer. Negative complex Poisson's ratio reduced
   from complex tensile and shear moduli was attributed to spongy-like
   tissue formation under crystallization of UHMWPE chains on the HA
   particle surface. The gradient composite molded maintained the
   spongy-like structure, which played an important role to avoid the
   cracking under bending stress.}},

Abstract = {{The aero-structural design of an adaptive vortex generator for
   repeatable, elastic, deployment and retraction from an aerodynamically
   clean surface is presented. A multidisciplinary objective function,
   containing geometrically nonlinear finite element analysis and large
   eddy simulation, is used to derive the optimal adaptive geometry for
   increasing the momentum of the near-wall fluid. It is found that the
   rapid increase of in-plane membrane stress with deflection is a
   significant limitation on achievable deformation of a continuous skin
   with uniform section. Use of a 2D auxetic lattice structure in place of
   the continuous skin allows for significantly larger deformations and
   thus a significant improvement in performance. The optimal deformed
   geometry is replicated statically and the effect on the boundary layer
   is validated in a wind tunnel experiment. The lattice structure is then
   manufactured and actuated. The deformed geometry is shown to compare
   well with the FEA predictions. The surface is re-examined post actuation
   and shown to return to the initial position, demonstrating the
   deformation is elastic and hence repeatable.}},

Title = {{Numerical Modelling of Rayleigh Wave in Homogeneous Soil Medium in
   Undamped Condition}},
Journal = {{INDIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the Rayleigh wave velocity, which is an important
   parameter in ground vibration analysis, is determined directly in an
   unbounded soil medium using numerical modelling with ABAQUS. The
   Rayleigh wave (R-wave) velocity is determined from the displacement time
   response of the finite element model at a single station for far-field
   condition. Using the results, a linear prediction equation is proposed
   to determine the R-wave velocity of the soil. For this a 2D finite
   element model coupled with infinite elements in the boundary is
   developed which is subjected to dynamic loading. After establishment of
   the presence of R wave in the soil medium using particle movement and
   validation of displacement time response with analytical models, the R
   wave velocity is determined using positive peak particle vertical
   displacement. The effect of material properties of soil medium, such as
   modulus of elasticity, density and Poisson ratio, on Rayleigh wave
   velocity are investigated using differential sensitivity analysis. The
   analysis shows that the modulus of elasticity has positive correlation
   with highest sensitivity coefficient whereas density and Poisson ratio
   have negative correlations with R wave velocity. A prediction equation
   is developed for R wave velocity for the input variables, the square
   root of specific modulus and Poisson ratio, using multiple linear
   regression in MATLAB. The accuracy and usefulness of the predictive
   equation is validated by comparing the predicted values of R wave
   velocity with values obtained from analytical model and field/lab
   measurements. Applying the predictive equation for the range of soil
   properties available in the literature, the R wave velocity of different
   soil types and conditions are evaluated, which can be used for the
   analysis and mitigation of ground vibration problems.}},

   ecological momentary assessment of smoking}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{883-899}},
Abstract = {{Ecological momentary assessment is an emerging method of data collection
   in behavioral research that may be used to capture the times of repeated
   behavioral events on electronic devices and information on subjects'
   psychological states through the electronic administration of
   questionnaires at times selected from a probability-based design as well
   as the event times. A method for fitting a mixed-Poisson point-process
   model is proposed for the impact of partially observed, time-varying
   covariates on the timing of repeated behavioral events. A random frailty
   is included in the point-process intensity to describe the variation in
   baseline rates of event occurrence among subjects. Covariate
   coefficients are estimated using estimating equations constructed by
   replacing the integrated intensity in the Poisson score equations with a
   design-unbiased estimator. An estimator is also proposed for the
   variance of the random frailties. Our estimators are robust in the sense
   that no model assumptions are made regarding the distribution of the
   time-varying covariates or the distribution of the random effects.
   However, subject effects are estimated under gamma frailties using an
   approximate hierarchical likelihood. The proposed approach is
   illustrated using smoking data.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency distributions of insect immatures per host are often fitted to
   contagious distributions, such as the negative binomial, to deduce
   oviposition pattern. However, different mechanisms can be involved for
   each theoretical distribution and additional biological information is
   needed to correctly interpret the fits. We chose the chestnut weevil
   Curculio elephas, a pest of the European chestnut Castanea sativa as a
   model to illustrate the difficulties of inferring oviposition pattern
   from fits to theoretical distributions and from the variance/mean ratio.
   From field studies over 13-16 years, we show that 20 out of the 31
   yearly distributions available Rt a negative binomial and 25 a
   zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP). No distribution fits a Poisson
   distribution. The ZIP distribution assumes heterogeneity within the
   fruit population. There are two categories of host: the first comprises
   chestnuts unsuitable for weevil oviposition or in excess relative to the
   number of weevil females, and the second comprises suitable fruits in
   which oviposition behavior is random. Our results confirm this host
   heterogeneity. According to the ZIP distribution, the first category of
   hosts includes on average 74\% of the chestnuts. A negative binomial
   distribution may be generated by either true or false contagion. We show
   that neither interference between weevil females, nor spatial variation
   in the infestation rate exist. Consequently, the observed distributions
   of immatures are not the result of false contagion. Nevertheless, we
   cannot totally exlude true contagion of immatures. In this paper we
   discuss the difficulty of testing true contagion in natural conditions.
   These results show that we cannot systematically conclude in favour of
   contagion when fitting a distribution such as the negative binomial or
   when a variance/mean ratio is higher than unity.}},

Abstract = {{Agarose hydrogels, which are composed of electrically neutral rigid

   describe some of the properties that the gels dispay upon deswelling:
   1 In conditions of uniaxial deswelling the gel undergoes a phase
   transition, which can be followed by analysing the concentration
   gradient generated in the sample.
   2 The mechanical properties of the deswollen gel are strongly
   anisotropic.
   3 The effective osmotic Poisson ratio sigma(os) = - (Delta
   lambda(perpendicular to)/Delta lambda(parallel to)) is negative, where
   Delta lambda(perpendicular to) and Delta lambda(parallel to) are the
   relative compressions of the sample in the directions perpendicular and

Abstract = {{A novel electro-active bushing (EAB) design is proposed based on the
   unique physical properties of dielectric elastomers. A dielectric
   elastomer is applied as the tendon layer to a circular two-dimensional
   double-V auxetic structure. When load and voltage excitation vary,
   mechanical performance and dimensions of dielectric elastomers change,
   which empowers EAB to realize an electrostrictive phenomenon and
   real-time variable stiffness under different voltages. An EAB structure
   can endure mechanical loads along all directions in a cross-sectional
   plane, which is more practical than our previous design which can only
   bear loads along one direction. A theoretical electromechanical model of
   an EAB unit cell was proposed based on the physics theory of dielectric
   elastomers. The influences of unit cell parameters on electromechanical
   responses were researched. Moreover, an EAB prototype was fabricated via
   the 3D printing method. The experiments using EAB prototype applied 3M
   VHB 4910 and 3M VHB 9473 acrylic membranes prestretched by 200\% and
   300\%, respectively, were conducted. The results indicated that the
   electrostrictive displacement increases as the load increases, and the
   stiffness decreases with the rise in voltage. Greater stiffness is
   obtained by higher original thickness and prestretch rates, but the
   electrostrictive displacement and stiffness variation under high
   excitation was dramatically affected.}},

Title = {{Association of the client-provider ratio with the risk of maternal
   mortality in referral hospitals: a multi-site study in Nigeria}},
Journal = {{REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: The paucity of human resources for health buoyed by
   excessive workloads has been identified as being responsible for poor
   quality obstetric care, which leads to high maternal mortality in
   Nigeria. While there is anecdotal and qualitative research to support
   this observation, limited quantitative studies have been conducted to
   test the association between the number and density of human resources
   and risk of maternal mortality. This study aims to investigate the
   association between client-provider ratios for antenatal and delivery
   care and the risk of maternal mortality in 8 referral hospitals in
   Nigeria.
   Methods: Client-provider ratios were calculated for antenatal and
   delivery care attendees during a 3-year period (2011-2013). The maternal
   mortality ratio (MMR) was calculated per 100,000 live births for the
   hospitals, while unadjusted Poisson regression analysis was used to
   examine the association between the number of maternal deaths and
   density of healthcare providers.
   Results: A total of 334,425 antenatal care attendees and 26,479 births
   were recorded during this period. The client-provider ratio in the
   maternity department for antenatal care attendees was 1343: 1 for
   doctors and 222: 1 for midwives. The ratio of births to one doctor in
   the maternity department was 106: 1 and 18: 1 for midwives. On average,
   there were 441 births per specialist obstetrician. The results of the
   regression analysis showed a significant negative association between
   the number of maternal deaths and client-provider ratios in all
   categories.
   Conclusion: We conclude that the maternal mortality ratios in Nigeria's
   referral hospitals are worsened by high client-provider ratios, with few
   providers attending a large number of pregnant women. Efforts to improve
   the density and quality of maternal healthcare providers, especially at
   the first referral level, would be a critical intervention for reducing
   the currently high rate of maternal mortality in Nigeria.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of multiple functions on the metamaterials can greatly
   broaden their potential application. Origami-based metamaterials, whose

   and experimentally investigates a multifunctional electromagnetic
   response with mechanically programmable characteristic based on an
   auxetic kirigami pattern in gigahertz frequency regime. The metamaterial
   unit cell has 2-dimensional (2D) five meta pixels. Each 2D meta-pixel
   can be transformed to the 3-dimensional (3D) meta-pixel and it is coded
   by ternary number (-1, 0, +1) for different folding levels. The kirigami
   pattern provides five transformable tessellations corresponding to five
   distinct functions of electromagnetic reflector, band-pass filter and
   polarization-selectable absorbers. The performance of the proposed
   programmable multifunctional metamaterial is numerically and

Abstract = {{The Hinde-Demtrio (HD) family of distributions, which are discrete
   exponential dispersion models with an additional real index parameter p,
   have been recently characterized from the unit variance function
   mu+mu(p). For p equals to 2, 3,..., the corresponding distributions are
   concentrated on non negative integers, overdispersed and zero-inflated
   with respect to a Poisson distribution having the same mean. The
   negative binomial (p=2) and strict arcsine (p=3) distributions are HD
   families; the limit case (p ->infinity) is associated to a suitable
   Poisson distribution. Apart from these count distributions, none of the
   HD distributions has explicit probability mass functions p(k). This
   article shows that the ratios r(k)=kp(k)/p(k-1), k=1,..., p-1, are equal
   and different from r(p). This new property allows, for a given count
   data set, to determine the integer p by some tests. The extreme
   situation of p=2 is of general interest for count data. Some examples
   are used for illustrations and discussions.}},

Abstract = {{Finite element models are developed for the in-plane linear elastic
   constants of a family of honeycombs comprising arrays of cylinders
   connected by ligaments. Honeycombs having cylinders with 3,4 and 6
   ligaments attached to them are considered, with two possible
   configurations explored for each of the 3-(trichiral and anti-trichiral)
   and 4- (tetrachiral and anti-tetrachiral) connected systems. Honeycombs
   for each configuration have been manufactured using rapid prototyping
   and subsequently characterised for mechanical properties through
   in-plane uniaxial loading to verify the models. An interesting
   consequence of the family of `chiral' honeycombs presented here is the
   ability to produce negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) response. The
   deformation mechanisms responsible for auxetic functionality in such
   honeycombs are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{By carrying out triaxial unloading test under different stress paths on
   rock, the complete stress-strain curves, deformation characteristics and
   its strength criterion are studied. The test results show that the
   relation between lateral strain and confining pressure firstly is
   linear, and then is nonlinear in the total stage of unloading confining
   pressure. And its growth rate is about 3 to 5 times the growth rate of
   the axial strain. It shows obvious lateral dilatancy, and the degree of
   dilatancy is related to the unloading path. According to the area that
   is enclosed by confining pressure and volumetric strain curve, it can be
   seen that the greater the confining pressure is before unloading, the
   more the energy releases. Deformation modulus decreases gradually with
   the unloading confining pressure, and increases with the initial
   confining pressure; the relation between deformation modulus and
   confining pressure shows negative exponential distribution overall. At
   the same unloading paths, the reduction of the deformation modulus
   increases with the increase of initial confining pressure. The Poisson's
   ratio rises up continually, and the variation law with the confining
   pressure can be well described by nonlinear. Failure characteristics of
   rock are mainly shear failure. The strength characteristics of rock can
   be well characterized by using the Mohr strength criterion of power
   function. These conclusions provide reliable theoretical reference and
   guiding significance for the deep mining of the underground metal mine.}},

Abstract = {{We present first-principles studies of structural, elastic, phonon,
   thermal and electronic properties of MnX. According to the calculated
   total energies, the predicted phase stability trends are consistent with
   previous experiments. For the L1(0) lattice, the calculated Mn-Mn
   exchange couplings J(Mn-Mns), depending on the valence electron
   concentration C-v, have been investigated. The dominant inter-layer
   nearest-neighbors coupling J(1L) and in-plane next-nearest-neighbor
   coupling J(2) are responsible for the differences in energy between the
   two structural phases (T=0 K). The negative shear modulus C' of the
   paramagnetic B2 (phase) triggers the cubic to tetragonal distortion. The
   calculated phonon dispersions indicate that the primary driving force
   for the paramagnetic L1(0) to antiferromagnetic L1(0) transition is the
   magnetic ordering energy, rather than some entropic contribution from
   thermal vibrations. The Debye temperatures, anisotropy and Poisson's
   ratio are also assessed. The calculated results show that the collinear
   antiferromagnetic CuAu-I type structures are mechanically and
   dynamically stable, and agree with the empirical ground states. (C) 2012

Title = {{Crustal structure and composition beneath the northeastern Tibetan
   plateau from receiver function analysis}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{249}},
Pages = {{51-58}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We analyzed hundreds of P-wave receiver function data recorded by 53
   portable seismic stations to investigate the crustal structure beneath
   the NE Tibetan plateau. The Moho depths identified by this study reveal
   that the crustal thickness decreases laterally from the Qilian Orogen
   (similar to 63 km) to east Kunlun fault (EKLF) area (similar to 44 km).
   The Moho depth becomes obviously deeper northeast of Songpan-Ganzi
   terrane and beneath the Qilian Orogen. A remarkable contrast is observed
   in the measured Poisson's ratio between the Qilian Orogen and EKLF area.
   The Qilian Orogen is characterized by lower Poisson's ratio. In general,
   the higher Poisson's ratios (v > 0.30) in the EKLF area can be
   considered as the evidence for dominantly mafic rocks in the crust. The
   measured low Poisson's ratio and the negative correlations between
   V-p/V-s and the crustal thickness beneath the Qilian Orogen suggest
   dominantly felsic crust beneath the Qilian Orogen, which is in contrast
   with the mid-to-lower low-velocity crustal model beneath the NE margin
   of the Tibetan plateau indicating that the low velocity zone terminates
   beneath the east Kunlun area. The seismic evidence suggests that the
   thickened crust is probably resulted from superposition of the
   successive intracrustal thrusts. Our results reveal the lateral
   inhomogeneity of crustal structure in this area and are inconsistent
   with the scenario of an inflated crust due to extrusion of lower crust
   material from the central Tibetan plateau. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials are man-made materials engineered to possess certain
   desired and often counterintuitive properties. It is well-known that
   elastic metamaterials may exhibit unusual bulk elastic properties when
   subject to dynamic loads at certain frequencies, such as negative
   Poisson's ratio, negative modulus, and/or negative mass density. This
   paper focuses on the modeling of a one-dimensional micropolar-type
   elastic metamaterial subject to transient dynamic loading. The
   metamaterial consists of unit cells that support both translational and
   rotational motion and can be modeled as a micropolar-type continuum.
   Interestingly, the equations governing the dynamics of the new
   micropolar-type continuum possess remarkable similitude with those
   governing the transient response of an elastic bar with elastic
   supports. The resulting governing equation is solved using the Fourier
   transform technique. The transient dynamic response of the metamaterial
   subject to an axial impact is then studied based on both the developed
   continuum model and the original discrete model. Finite element analysis
   of the equivalent bar model is also conducted. The results from the
   developed continuum model is compared with the discrete model and the
   finite element analysis to evaluate its suitability. This work presents
   a novel micropolar-type model for a specific metamaterial and
   investigates its transient response using both continuum modeling and
   discrete unit cell modeling. The results indicate that the
   micropolar-type model can accurately capture the transient behavior of
   the propagation of the strain pulse in the metamaterial}},

Abstract = {{The problem of linear elasticity for free harmonic (periodic) and
   solitary bell-shaped (nonperiodic) waves in an isotropic half-space with
   stress-free plane boundary is considered. The half-space is made of
   either conventional (classical structural) or nonconventional
   (nonclassical auxetic) material. Two cases of wave damping are studied:
   rapid (surface wave) and periodic (nonsurface wave). The following
   conclusions on a free harmonic wave are drawn: a surface wave exists in
   materials of both classes, but the ratio of the wave velocity to the
   velocity of a transverse plane wave in auxetic materials is somewhat
   lower than in conventional materials; a nonsurface wave cannot be
   described by the approach applied to conventional materials, but can
   theoretically exist in auxetic materials where there are two wave
   velocities. For a solitary (bell-shaped) wave, the assumption that the
   wave velocity depends on the wave phase is substantiated and some
   constraint is imposed on the time of travel of the wave and the way the
   wave velocity varies with time. The following conclusions are drawn: a
   rapidly damped bell-shaped wave cannot be described by the approach for
   both classes of materials, whereas a periodically damped bell-shaped
   wave can be described.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{24}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This work describes the behavior of a novel class of hierarchical
   slotted and asymmetrical edge cellular shapes honeycombs with auxetic
   and non-auxetic configurations subjected to edgewise compression.
   Hierarchical (slotted) and non-hierarchical specimens including
   hexagonal, re-entrant and asymmetric re-entrant have been 3D printed by
   using PLA plastic and tested under edgewise compression along the
   in-plane directions. The material properties of the PLA plastics have
   been determined via tensile tests, and Finite Element analyses have been
   performed using the LS-DYNA code to benchmark force-displacement curves
   with the experimental results. The numerical models were validated by
   comparing the load-displacement responses with the experimental results
   for each sample. Linear elastic properties, crashworthiness and energy
   absorption capability of the novel honeycomb structures are evaluated
   from the experimental and numerical standpoint. Specific metrics like
   compressive normalized modulus, compressive strength and specific energy
   absorption (SEA) are evaluated. The Poisson's ratio of the novel
   honeycomb configurations has been evaluated and the impact of the
   deformation mechanisms of the different cellular shapes during
   crashworthiness has been studied. The results show that the use of the
   slotted and asymmetric cells proposed in this work could increase
   strength, stiffness and energy absorption capacity and also increase the
   stability of the samples during deformation.}},

Abstract = {{The anisotropic mechanical properties of Tl4Ag18Te11 compound was
   investigated elaborately for the first time by using Density Functional
   Theory calculations with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package in this
   work. Tl4Ag18Te11 compound was optimized in the I4mm space group and the
   formation energy was determined as a negative value that is the
   indication of the experimental synthesizability of this compound. The
   optimized crystal structure was employed for the calculations of the
   elastic constants and the obtained values revealed the mechanical
   stability of Tl4Ag18Te11 compound. The polycrystalline properties were
   determined such as shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, etc. In addition, the
   anisotropic elastic properties were presented. The direction dependent
   sound waves velocities, polarization of the sound waves, enhancement
   factor and the power flow angle were determined. The thermal
   conductivity studies were performed and the minimum thermal conductivity
   (0.259 W m(-1)K(-1)) and the diffusion thermal conductivity (0.202 W
   m(-1)K(-1)) were calculated. This study illustrates the capability of

Abstract = {{The in-plane flexible shear property of hexagonal honeycombs may be
   useful for the compliant structural applications. In this paper,
   hyperelastic strain energy functions are developed for a finite in-plane
   shear deformation of hexagonal honeycombs over a constituent material's
   elastic range. Effective shear stress-strain curves of hexagonal
   structures and local cell wall deformation are investigated using the
   finite element based homogenization method. The hyperelastic models,
   which are only related to the effective properties of a honeycomb, may
   not be good enough to capture the nonlinear behavior at a high
   macroscopic shear strain level. The primary microscopic cell wall
   deformation mode under macroscopic in-plane shear loading was identified
   to be the bending of the vertical cell wall h, which is perpendicular to
   the macroscopic loading direction. The re-entrant hexagonal structures
   having a negative Poisson's ratio shows a high macroscopic shear
   flexible property associated with the high h when the honeycombs are
   designed to have the same macroscopic shear modulus. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{In this paper, an isogeometric density field method is proposed for the
   design of micro-architected materials with the specific mechanical
   properties, consisting of the maximum bulk and shear modulus and the
   Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). Firstly, the non-uniform rational
   B-splines (NURBS) basis functions are employed to construct the density
   field function (DFF), where the Shepard function is used to improve the
   smoothness of the nodal densities assigned to control points. The NURBS
   basis functions and the Shepard function can ensure the sufficient
   continuity and smoothness of the DFF, owing to their significant
   properties. The optimization formulation for micro-architected materials
   is developed using the DFF, where the isogeometric analysis (IGA) is
   applied to evaluate the unknown structural responses. Effective
   macroscopic properties of materials are predicted by the asymptotic
   homogenization method. The same NURBS basis functions used in the IGA
   and the DFF can keep the consistency of the geometric model and analysis
   model, which provides the unique benefits. Numerical examples are used
   to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed topology optimization
   approach for micro-architected materials.}},

Abstract = {{Penta-graphene has recently been proposed as a new allotrope of carbon
   composed of pure pentagons, and displays many novel properties going
   beyond graphene {[}Zhang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 2015,
   112, 2372]. To further explore the property modulations, we have carried
   out a theoretical investigation of the hydrogenated and fluorinated
   penta-graphene sheets. Our first-principles calculations reveal that
   hydrogenation and fluorination can effectively tune the electronic and
   mechanical properties of penta-graphene: turning the sheet from
   semiconducting to insulating; changing the Poisson's ratio from negative
   to positive, and reducing the Young's modulus. Moreover, the band gaps
   of the hydrogenated and fluorinated penta-graphene sheets are larger
   than those of fully hydrogenated and fluorinated graphene by 0.37 and
   0.04 eV, respectively. The phonon dispersions and ab initio molecular
   dynamics simulations confirm that the surface modified penta-graphene
   sheets are dynamically and thermally stable, and show that the
   hydrogenated penta-graphene has more Raman-active modes with higher
   frequencies as compared to the fluorinated penta-graphene.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive research is being devoted to the analysis and application of
   cellular solids for the design of structural components with superior
   mechanical properties and multifunctional characteristics. The chiral
   geometry in particular is an innovative configuration which features an
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio which leads to a very high shear
   modulus, while maintaining some degree of compliance. This unique
   mechanical behavior can be exploited for the design of sandwich
   structures with a core composed of a macroscopic chiral truss, laid out
   across the thickness. This concept, also denoted as ``truss-core{''}, is
   applied for the design of two-dimensional airfoils with both static and
   dynamic morphing capabilities. A coupled-physics model, comprising
   simultaneous CFD and elastic analyses, is developed to investigate the
   influence of the chiral core on the aerodynamic behavior of an airfoil.
   The model, in particular, predicts the static deflection of the airfoil
   as a result of given flow conditions. The morphing capabilities of the
   airfoil, here quantified as camber changes, are evaluated for various
   design configurations of the core.}},

   conduits (e.g., sewage pipelines, shafts, tunnels, or penstocks) to
   their surroundings. The liner is usually designed to resist buckling
   from external grout pressure during installation or from the external
   water pressure or internal negative pressure when the conduit is
   dewatered quickly for inspection and/or maintenance. This study uses the
   finite element method to investigate the inelastic stability of
   cylindrical liners with localized wavy imperfections. The liner's
   material is assumed to follow elastic-perfectly-plastic stress-strain
   relationship. The effects of the different geometrical parameters of the
   liner on its stability are studied. This is in addition to the effect of
   the liner's material properties (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and
   yield stress) on its buckling pressure. Results of the study are
   expected to contribute to the understanding of the mechanical behavior
   of locally imperfect cylindrical liners when subjected to external
   uniform pressure, and also in the improvement of the associated design
   standards. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Being one of new generation of composites, functionally graded materials
   (FGMs) possess gradually changed physical properties due to their
   compositional and/or microstructural gradients. In literature,
   exhaustive studies have been carried out in compositional modeling and
   design, while limited reports are available for microstructural
   optimization. This article presents an inverse homogenization method for
   the design of two-phase (solid/void) FGM microstructures, whose periodic
   base cells (PBCs) vary in a direction parallel to the property gradient
   but periodically repeat themselves in the perpendicular direction. The
   effective elasticity tensor at each PBC is estimated in terms of the
   homogenization theory. The overall difference between the effective
   tensor and their target is minimized by seeking for an optimal PBC
   material topology. To preserve the connectivity between adjacent PBCs,
   three methods, namely connective constraint, pseudo load, and unified
   formulation with nonlinear diffusion are proposed herein. A number of
   two-dimensional examples possessing graded volume fraction and Young's
   modulus but constant positive or negative Poisson's ratios are presented
   to demonstrate this computational design procedure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, series of full-scale cutting tests and cutting
   simulations are carried out to investigate the influence of installation
   parameter and geometry of the pick on cutting performance. The discrete
   element method is used to simulate the rock cutting process. A general
   process to calibrate macro properties of rock including uniaxial
   compressive strength (UCS), elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, cohesion
   and internal friction angle is proposed and used to complete the
   calibration of coal model. The cutting simulations are performed using
   picks with different tip angles and rake angles. The results show that
   the peak cutting force (PCF) decreases with the increase of rake angle
   following an inverse proportional function when the rake angle is
   positive, while it varies following a parabolic curve in the condition
   of negative rake angle. Moreover, the crack mode changes from primarily
   shear failure to primarily tensile failure with the increase of rake
   angle. Finally, a multiple-attribute index is proposed to evaluate the
   cutting performance and select the optimum cutting parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Elasticity tensor components, C-ij, the crystallographic dependence of
   Poisson's ratio, the phase stability, and vibrational spectra are
   computed for nonmagnetic and magnetic CeMg (1:1 Ce:Mg) structures using
   density functional theory. Results from both the generalized gradient
   approximation (GGA), and the GGA + U, based upon an effective on-site
   Coulomb potential, U-eff, are investigated. The GGA low energy
   structure, with wavevector along {[}110], disagrees with experiment,
   while the {[}100] structure from experiment is predicted as the 0 K
   structure in the GGA + U. Accurate estimation of the 20 K Neel
   temperature can only be achieved with small Ueff, which suggests that
   CeMg is not a strongly correlated system. For all CeMg structures
   investigated, we find C-11 approximate to C-44; this is consistent with
   the near equivalency of transverse and longitudinal sound speeds. The
   origin of this behavior is the negative stretching force constants for
   the interaction between the second- and third-nearest-neighbor Mg and Ce
   ions, respectively. Results are compared with neutron scattering
   experiments at 30 and 110 K.}},

Abstract = {{A new estimator for estimating the size of an elusive target population
   is presented using frequency counts from capture-recapture sampling. The
   proposed estimator is developed by extending the idea of Chaos estimator
   using monotonicity of ratios of neighbouring frequency counts under a
   specific Poisson mixture sampling framework, the Poisson-Gamma mixture
   or negative binomial. The new estimator is achieved using a simple
   linear model on the basis of the log-ratio of neighbouring frequency
   counts as dependent variable which is valid under the Poisson-Gamma
   mixture. A simulation study is provided to study the performance of the
   proposed estimator under a variety of heterogeneous Poisson capture
   probabilities. Confidence interval estimation is done by means of an
   approximating normal approach and a modified bootstrap method, and was
   found to perform well. A variety of real data sets were also examined in
   order to illustrate the use of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purpose: Highly skewed count data with excess zeros challenge the
   application of conventional statistical methods. Additional problems
   arise from repeated zero-inflated measures. Longitudinal zero-inflated
   Poisson (ZIP-mixed) models are mixtures of logistic and Poisson models
   that accommodate excess zeros and repeated counts. We compared a
   ZIP-mixed model with traditional Poisson and negative binomial models
   using data on problems with female condom use reported by women at high
   risk of sexually transmitted diseases.
   Methods: The follow-up experience of this cohort represents a mixture of
   ``perfect use{''} (no opportunity to report problems), represented by
   the structural zeros, and use experience that bears the risk of condom
   use problems, represented by a Poisson distribution.
   Results: The ZIP-mixed model provided better fit and richer results than
   other models. The odds of being in the zero problem category increased
   with age (odds ratio {[}OR] = 1.1 per additional year, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 1.0-1.3) and with follow-up (OR = 3.0 per additional
   month, 95\% CI: 1.4-6.0). The nonzero problem rate was lower among women
   who believed in the benefits of condom use (rate ratio {[}RR] = 0.9,
   95\% CI: 0.7-1.0) and had no sexually transmitted diseases at baseline
   (RR = 0.7, 95\% CI: 0.6-0.9), and it decreased during follow-up (RR =
   0.8 per additional month, 95\% CI: 0.7-0.9).
   Conclusions: Using ZIP-mixed model provided further insights into the
   determinants of condom failure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The entropy inequality, commonly taken as an axiom of continuum
   mechanics, is found to be spontaneously violated in macroscopic granular
   media undergoing collisional dynamics. The result falls within the
   fluctuation theorem of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, which is known to
   replace the Second Law for finite systems. This phenomenon amounts to
   the system stochastically displaying negative increments of entropy. The
   focus is on granular media in Couette flows, consisting of monosized
   circular disks (with 10 to 104 disks of diameters 0.01 m to 1 m) with
   frictional-Hookean contacts simulated by molecular dynamics accounting
   for micropolar effects. Overall, it is determined that the probability
   of negative entropy increments diminishes with the Eulerian velocity
   gradient increasing, while it tends to increase in a sigmoidal fashion
   with the Young modulus of disks increasing. This behavior is examined
   for a very wide range of known materials: from the softest polymers to
   the stiffest (i.e., carbyne). The disks' Poisson ratio is found to have
   a weak effect on the probability of occurrence of negative entropy
   increments.}},

Abstract = {{Micro/nano positioning stages play an essential role in micro/nano
   precision technology, so the design and development of a new six-axis
   micro positioning stage are presented in this research. Based on
   Steward's theory, the stage adopts negative Poisson's ratio with flexure
   hinges. Since each of the axes is a planar mechanism structure, the
   stage is fabricated out of aluminum with the micro machining - a simple
   and well - developed fabrication technique for cost down and batch
   production. The stage consists of a top plate and a base plate, two
   hexagons of which the diameters are respectively 22 mm and 95.2 mm with
   a distance of 21.6 mm in between, and six trapezoid amplifiers, each of
   which is connected to the base plate at an angle of 30 degrees. Each
   amplifier consists of three layers two inner layers of symmetrical
   flexure hinges and one outer layer of non-symmetrical flexure hinge.
   In this research, the stress, strain and amplification are calculated
   with the software of SolidWorks Ansys@. In experiment, each amplifier is
   driven by a piezoelectric transducer (PZT), and the displacements are
   measure wit a laser displacement sensor and recorded for comparison of
   the single-axis amplifier with the six-axis stage. The results show that
   the amplification of the displacement of a single-axis amplifier is 15
   times, that the horizon translation, the vertical translation, the tilt
   angle and the rotational angle are 50 Pm, 50 pm, 0.5 degrees and 0.5
   degrees respectively, and that the displacement resolution and the
   rotational resolution are 15.6 nm and 2.7 mu rad respectively. It is
   obvious that the six-axis stage of this research, indeed, retains the
   features of high amplification and minimization, and is a novel and
   low-cost six-axis micro positioning stage.

Title = {{Testing independence between discrete random variables}},
Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we develop a likelihood ratio test for independence
   between multivariate discrete random vectors whose components may be
   dependent or may have different marginal distributions. A special case
   that tests independence between two discrete random variables is also
   discussed. The model under the null hypothesis is constructed based on
   the marginal distributions of the random variables, while the model
   under the alternative is built by adding a common random effect which is
   not restricted to follow the same distribution as those of the other
   variables. The test statistic is shown to admit an asymptotic
   distribution of a weighted sum of chi-square random variables, each with
   one degree of freedom. In order to avoid the high computational cost of
   finding the parameters of the asymptotic distribution, a
   permutation-based procedure is introduced. It is shown in simulations
   that the permutation-based realization yields empirical level close to
   the nominal level, while achieving power comparable to or higher than
   that of existing competitors in the literature. The application of the
   test is illustrated with a real data set.}},

Title = {{In-plane compression behavior of hybrid honeycomb metastructures:
   Theoretical and experimental studies}},
Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{106}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic cellular structures with outstanding mechanical performance and
   unique deformation characteristics have a variety of potential
   applications in aerospace, as ultralight load-bearing structures and
   vibration isolation structures. Herein, the in-plane compression
   behaviors of hybrid honeycomb metastructures, comprised of conventional
   and auxetic honeycombs, are systematically studied by using theoretical
   calculations, experimental characterization and numerical simulations.
   The theoretical formulae of elastic modulus and ultimate strength of the
   architected metastructure are derived by establishing stress analysis
   models. Three types of hybrid honeycomb metastructures are manufactured
   by selective laser melting (SLM) with 304 stainless steel. Finite
   element analysis is performed to unveil the deformation mechanism and
   failure modes. The theoretical prediction results of elastic modulus and
   ultimate strength are consistent with simulations and experimental
   results. In addition, the influences of panel and layer numbers on the
   mechanical behavior of hybrid honeycomb metastructures are discussed in
   detail. The results reveal that a hybrid metallic honeycomb
   metastructure, with stable and superior compressive properties, can be
   obtained by combining two types of cellular cells, i.e., conventional
   and auxetic honeycombs. These results provide a baseline for further
   research and development of novel metastructure designs. (C) 2020

Title = {{On three-dimensional dilational elastic metamaterials}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{Dilational materials are stable, three-dimensional isotropic auxetics
   with an ultimate Poisson's ratio of -1. Inspired by previous theoretical
   work, we design a feasible blueprint for an artificial material, a
   metamaterial, which approaches the ideal of a dilational material. The
   main novelty of our work is that we also fabricate and characterize
   corresponding metamaterial samples. To reveal all modes in the design,
   we calculate the phonon band structures. On this basis, using cubic
   symmetry we can unambiguously retrieve all different non-zero elements
   of the rank-four effective metamaterial elasticity tensor from which all
   effective elastic metamaterial properties follow. While the elastic
   properties and the phase velocity remain anisotropic, the effective
   Poisson's ratio indeed becomes isotropic and approaches -1 in the limit
   of small internal connections. This finding is also supported by
   independent, static continuum-mechanics calculations. In static
   experiments on macroscopic polymer structures fabricated by
   three-dimensional printing, we measure Poisson's ratios as low as -0.8
   in good agreement with the theory. Microscopic samples are also
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To examine the utility of the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP)
   and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) modelling approaches for
   modelling four sets of dental caries data from the same cohort study
   {[}with particular attention to the influence of childhood socioeconomic
   status (SES)]: cross-sectional data on the deciduous dentition at age 5
   years; cross-sectional data on the permanent dentition at age 18 and 26
   years; and longitudinal data on caries increment between ages 18 and 26
   years. Methods: Data on dental caries occurrence at ages 5, 18 and 26
   years were obtained from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and
   Development Study (DMHDS). ZIP and ZINB models were fitted to the
   cross-sectional (n = 745) and longitudinal (n = 809) data sets using
   Stata (Intercooled Stata 7.0). The dependent variables for the three
   cross-sectional analyses were the DMFS indices at age 5, 18, and 26
   years, and net DFS increment (NETDFS) was the dependent variable for the
   longitudinal analysis. Results: The empty ZIP model was a poor fit for
   all four data sets, whereas the empty ZINB model showed good fit;
   consequently both the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were
   conducted using ZINB modelling. Being in the high-SES group during
   childhood was associated with a greater probability of being caries-free
   by age 18 years, over and above that which would be expected from the
   negative binomial process. Low childhood SES also had the largest
   coefficient in the modelling of the negative binomial process, but at
   age 5 years, where the adjusted mean dmfs score in the low-SES group was
   6.8 (compared with 4.7 and 2.9 in the medium- and high-SES groups,
   respectively). The substantial SES differences which existed at age 5
   years (in the deciduous dentition) had reduced somewhat by age 18 years,
   and had widened again by age 26 years. In the longitudinal analysis,
   `baseline' caries experience (age 18-year DMFS) was a predictor both of
   being an extra zero and of caries severity. Conclusion: This
   investigation of the utility of the zero-inflated approach for modelling
   both cross-sectional and longitudinal caries data has shown that
   ZIP/ZINB models can provide new insight into disease patterns. It is
   anticipated that they will become increasingly useful in epidemiological
   studies that use the DMF index as the outcome measure.}},

Abstract = {{Honeycombs, as cores in sandwich panels, are in wider use in transport
   applications where density-specific performance is critical. The ability
   of honeycombs to withstand through-thickness compression, and in
   particular resist buckling, is a key performance factor in many
   applications. However reports of the systematic study of buckling limits
   in such materials are scant. Honeycomb unit cells with a range of
   geometries, including conventional hexagonal, re-entrant hexagonal
   geometries, and modifications of both thereof, were tested mechanically
   and simulated via finite element modelling. The primary figure of merit
   was the density-specific peak compressive stress immediately prior to
   onset of buckling collapse. The conventional hexagonal honeycomb unit
   cell, as examined here, is not well optimised for density-specific peak
   stress; in comparison the re-entrant unit cell examined here had
   approximately 13\% higher density-specific peak stress. Modifications to
   these geometries, such as face stiffeners and fillets, increased
   absolute values of peak stress but in most cases were deleterious or at
   best neutral to density-specific peak stress due to the subsequent
   increase mass of the honeycombs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The pressure effects on the mechanical, optoelectronic and

   shifting from indirect to direct nature at the moderate pressure 15 GPa,
   due to which, phonon heating effects during the optical transitions can
   be avoided. Optical parameters such as dielectric constants, refraction
   etc., are discussed for the impinging energy range 0-30 eV. The external
   pressure dependent electrical and thermal conductivities, power factor,
   specific heat capacitance, Hall-coefficient etc. are also investigated
   for 0-800 K. The optoelectronic and thermoelectric natures demonstrate
   BaSiO3 suitability for the renewable energy device applications.}},

Abstract = {{The recently discovered tetragonal, monoclinic and orthorhombic
   polymorphs of M3N4 (M-C, Si, Sn) are investigated by using
   first-principles calculations. A set of anisotropic elastic quantities,
   i.e., the bulk and shear moduli, Young's modulus, Poisson ratio B/G
   ratio and Vickers hardness of M3N4 (M=C, Si, Sn) are predicted. The
   quasi-harmonic Debye model, assuming that the solids are isotopic, may
   lead to large errors for the non-cubic crystals. The thermal effects are
   obtained by the traditional quasi-harmonic approach. The dependences of
   heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient and Debye temperature on
   temperature and pressure are systematically discussed in the pressure
   range of 0-10 GPa and in the temperature range of 0-1100 K. More
   importantly, o-C3N4 is a negative thermal expansion material. Our
   results may have important consequences in shaping the understanding of
   the fundamental properties of these binary nitrides.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been growing interest in utilizing electrical fields
   to position and separate rod-shaped particles such as DNA molecules,
   actin filaments, microtubules, viruses, bacteria, nanotubes. and
   nanorods. The polarization of the electrical double layer, enveloping
   the rod, plays a critical role in determining the magnitude and
   direction of the rod's dipole moment. We consider noninteracting,
   rod-shaped (spherocylinder) particles and calculate the induced dipole
   moment as a function of the electrical field frequency, the rod's aspect
   ratio (length/radius), the rod's free surface charge, and the
   double-layer thickness. To this end, we solve the Poisson Nernst Planck
   (PNP) equations for the ions' migration, diffusion, and convection. When
   the surface charge is small and the rod is short, the dipole moment is
   negative. As the rod's length increases, the dipole moment increases and
   eventually changes sign from negative to positive. The dipole
   coefficient of a rod, whose length is greater than some critical value,
   increases linearly with length. This latter observation simplifies the
   estimation of the dipole moment of particles with large aspect ratios
   (length/radius). The theoretical predictions are compared and favorably
   agree with experimental data for double-stranded, short DNA molecules.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{322-330}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{First-principles calculations using density functional theory (DFT) were
   performed to explore the effect of common 3d elements M (M = Ti, V, Cr,
   Mn, Co, Ni and Cu) on the mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties
   of Fe2B. A formula of (Fe-0.875,M-0.125)(2)B was used. Firstly, the
   negative cohesive energy and formation enthalpy suggest that all the
   compounds are thermodynamically stable. With the knowledge of calculated
   elastic constants, the moduli, the Pugh's modulus ratio G/B, the
   Poisson's ratio v and the hardness of Fe2B and (Fe-0.875,M-0.125)(2)B
   were further predicted. Overall, with increasing atomic number, the
   moduli and hardness of the borides initially increase and then decrease.
   (Fe-0.875,Cr-0.125)(2)B possesses the largest bulk, shear and Young's
   modulus simultaneously, while (Fe0.875,Mn0.125)(2)B has the largest
   hardness. The G/B and v values indicate that all the alloying elements
   are able to enhance the ductility of the Fe2B except Mn, but they do not
   change the nature of intrinsic brittleness of the Fe2B. Combined with
   the electronic structures, we revealed that the mechanical properties of
   the borides are mostly determined by Fe-B and M-B bonds. Fe-Fe bonds in
   < 2 2 0 > and < 1 1 3 > orientations are both covalent bonding. It can
   also be predicted that all the alloying elements reduce the magnetic
   moments (Ms) of the Fe2B mainly because the Ms of the substituted M atom
   is smaller than that of Fe atom. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the multivariate Poisson Lognormal modeling of
   counts for different types of crashes. This multivariate model can
   account for the overdispersion as well as positive and/or negative
   association between counts. Approximate Bayesian inference via the
   Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations significantly decreases
   computational time which makes it attractive for researchers. The models
   are developed for single vehicle, same direction and opposite direction
   crash types using three years (2009-2011) of crash data on Connecticut
   divided limited access highway segments. Annual average daily traffic,
   segment length, and road specific covariates (median type, shoulder
   width, area type, and on-ramp indicator) are used as predictor
   variables. The results from the multivariate Poisson Lognormal model
   suggest that an increase in the annual average daily traffic, segment
   length, and shoulder width together with urban area type and presence of
   an on-ramp are associated with in an increase in crashes. The median
   type covariate has a mixed effect for different median types on
   different type of crashes. The multivariate Poisson Lognormal model
   results are compared with the results obtained from two univariate
   regression models, univariate Poisson Lognormal and univariate negative
   binomial, with respect to model implications and precision on analysis
   of crash counts. The results show that the coefficient estimates of
   predictors have almost similar effects across all three crash type count
   models; however, standard errors in the multivariate Poisson Lognormal
   model are smaller than standard errors from other two univariate models
   in most cases. Results on posterior means for the correlation
   coefficients between crash types indicate that there are significant
   correlations exist between the crash count vectors, which indicate that
   ignoring such a correlation could possibly lead to incorrect variance
   estimation for the parameters. Results on predicted mean absolute error
   (PMAE) indicate that Bayesian multivariate Poisson Lognormal model
   provides up to 33\% less prediction error compared to the univariate
   negative binomial model, although there are no significant difference of
   PMAE values between multivariate and univariate Poisson Lognormal models
   results. The analysis results demonstrated that the Bayesian
   multivariate Poisson Lognormal model provides correct estimates for
   parameters in predicting crash counts by accounting for correlations in
   the multivariate crash counts. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper extends the theory of a filtered Poisson process proposed by
   Snyder {[}Random Point Processes, Wiley New York, 1975]. The cumulants
   for the filtered Poisson process have been given by Snyder. The filtered
   Poisson process is a particular form of a filtered point process in
   which the point process is a compound Poisson process. In practice, the
   point process is not always Poissionian and it might be represented by
   the binomial or negative binomial distribution. Thus, it is advantageous
   to construct the statistical properties of a filtered point process on
   the basis that the occurrence counting process is of both the binomial
   and the negative binomial types. This paper derives the characteristic
   functional for a filtered point process where the point process is of
   both the binomial and the negative binomial types. The first four
   cumulants for these types are also deduced. From these cumulants, we can
   readily obtain the basic statistics (mean, variance, coefficient of
   skewness, coefficient of kurtosis, and correlation coefficient) of a
   random variable that can be modeled as a filtered point process. (C)

Abstract = {{This work presents the derivation of general streamflow cumulants from
   daily rainfall time series. The general streamflow cumulants can be used
   to compute basic streamflow statistics such as mean, variance,
   coefficient of skewness, and correlation coefficient. Streamflow is
   considered as a filtered point process where the input is a daily
   rainfall time series assumed to be a marked point process. The marks of
   the process are the daily rainfall amounts which are assumed independent
   and identically distributed. The number of rainfall occurrences is a
   counting process represented by either the binomial, the Poisson, or the
   negative binomial probability distribution depending on its ratio of
   mean to variance. The first three cumulants and the covariance function
   of J-day averaged streamflows are deduced based on the characteristic

   the stochastic properties of the daily rainfall process and the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we touch on the mechanical behavior of casing-infill
   composite tubes, as potential new lightweight structural elements. The
   axial and the torsional behavior of composite tubes of circular
   cross-section, comprising a casing and an infill, is addressed
   analytically, to develop physical insight into the mechanical
   interactions between these two components, in the linear range. The
   influence of the material parameters of the infill, relative to those of
   the casing, and of geometry - such as the ratio of wall-thickness to
   diameter of the casing - on the structural stiffness and capacity of the
   composite are revealed and presented in a novel graphical form. It is
   shown that significantly improved overall stiffness and capacity at
   yield can be obtained by bonding a moderately softer, but highly
   auxetic, infill to the casing, which highlights the need to develop new
   lightweight auxetic materials, without compromising their stiffness.
   These predictions are verified in torsion and confirmed in bending by
   means of suitable computational models based on the finite element
   method.}},

Journal = {{METALS}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the influence of substitutional elements (Ti and
   Al) on the structural stability, mechanical properties, electronic
   properties and Debye temperature of Ta5Si3 with a D8(m) structure were
   investigated by first principle calculations. The Ta5Si3 alloyed with Ti
   and Al shows negative values of formation enthalpies, indicating that
   these compounds are energetically stable. Based on the values of
   formation enthalpies, Ti exhibits a preferential occupying the Ta-4b
   site and Al has a strong site preference for the Si-8h site. From the
   values of the bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G) and Young's modulus
   (E), we determined that both Ti and Al additions decrease both the shear
   deformation resistance and the elastic stiffness of D8(m) structured
   Ta5Si3. Using the shear modulus/bulk modulus ratio (G/B), Poisson's
   ratio (upsilon) and Cauchy's pressure, the effect of Ti and Al additions
   on the ductility of D8(m)-structured Ta5Si3 are explored. The results
   show that Ti and Al additions reduce the hardness, resulting in solid
   solution softening, but improve the ductility of D8(m)-structured
   Ta5Si3. The electronic calculations reveal that Ti and Al additions
   change hybridization between Ta-Si and Si-Si atoms for the binary
   D8(m)-structured Ta5Si3. The new Ta-Al bond is weaker than the Ta-Si
   covalent bonds, reducing the covalent property of bonding in
   D8(m)-structured Ta5Si3, while the new strong Ti-4b-Ti-4b anti-bonding
   enhances the metallic behavior of the binary D8(m)-structured Ta5Si3.
   The change in the nature of bonding can well explain the improved
   ductility of D8(m)-structured Ta5Si3 doped by Ti and Al. Moreover, the
   Debye temperatures, (D), of D8(m)-structured Ta5Si3 alloying with Ti and
   Al are decreased as compared to the binary Ta5Si3.}},

Abstract = {{This paper looks into the effects of various porous structures used in
   the construction of the shell of a protective helmet on the energy
   absorption capacity and their efficacy in protecting the head/skull
   against impact force. It is well known that porous structures are very
   effective for energy absorption; hence, they have been widely used to
   reduce the negative effects of impact and explosion loads on the human
   skull. Porous shell structures, made from titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V)
   and, comprised of several periodic topological configurations, namely
   the more common rectangle and hexagonal honeycomb, as well as those
   having auxetic properties, namely the concave honeycomb and
   double-arrow, are studied by means of numerical modeling. The
   reliability of the numerical model is validated with the published
   experimental results. For the double-arrow configurations, the study
   involves three different densities, and the structural energy absorption
   capacity of the double-arrow shells increases with density. For the same
   density, the energy absorption capacity of the rectangular shell is the
   best, and that of the honeycomb is the worst. The superior performance
   of the rectangular configuration is partly derived from the fact that
   the orientation of the struts in this structure is aligned along the
   direction of the impact force. Further comparison of energy absorption
   capacity is made between the porous shell and a shell having a
   traditional titanium monolayer. The severe plastic deformation in the
   solid titanium shell (traditional monolayer shell) is detrimental to the
   overall effectiveness of head protection gear. Apart from this, compared
   with the Kevlar composite laminated shell of the same mass, both the
   solid and porous titanium shells provide considerable protection to the
   human head. The comprehensive comparisons show that the porous design on
   the titanium shell is beneficial for mitigating the risks of traumatic
   brain injuries (TBIs).}},

Abstract = {{Bayesian optimization (BO) is a global optimization method that has the
   potential for design optimization. However, in classical BO algorithm,
   the variables are considered as continuous. In real-world engineering
   problems, both continuous and discrete variables are present. In this
   work, an efficient approach to incorporate discrete variables to BO is
   proposed. In the proposed constrained mixed-integer BO method, the
   sample set is decomposed into smaller clusters during sequential
   sampling, where each cluster corresponds to a unique ordered set of
   discrete variables, and a Gaussian process regression (GP) metamodel is
   constructed for each cluster. The model prediction is formed as the
   Gaussian mixture model, where the weights are computed based on the
   pair-wise Wasserstein distance between clusters and gradually converge
   to an independent GP as the optimization process advances. The
   definition of neighborhood can be flexibly and manually defined to
   account for independence between clusters, such as in the case of
   categorical variables. Theoretical results are provided in concert with
   two numerical and engineering examples, and two examples for
   metamaterial developments, including one fractal and one auxetic
   metamaterials, where the effective properties depend on both the
   geometry and the bulk material properties.}},

Abstract = {{There are concerns that emerging resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQ) may
   be leading to increasing rates of gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia in
   hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. We set out to describe
   time trends in the incidence rates of GNR bacteremia and FQ-resistant
   GNR bacteremia in HCT recipients during an era of levofloxacin
   prophylaxis. We conducted a longitudinal retrospective study of adults
   undergoing allogeneic HCT between 2003 and 2012 at the Seattle Cancer
   Care Alliance (SCCA). Annual trends in the incidence rates of GNR
   bacteremia and FQ-resistant GNR bacteremia through 100 days after
   transplantation were assessed using Poisson regression. Cox proportional
   hazards regression was used to compare 30-day mortality between patients
   with FQ-resistant and those with FQ-sensitive GNR bacteremia. Of the
   2306 patients included in this cohort, 280 (12.1\%) had GNR bacteremia.
   The incidence rates of GNR bacteremia and FQ-resistant GNR bacteremia
   increased from 2003 to 2009 and decreased afterwards; however, the
   overall annual trends were not significant (incidence rate ratio
   {[}IRR], 1.01; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], .98 to 1.05; IRR, 1.01;
   95\% CI, .95 to 1.08, respectively). FQ-resistant GNR bacteremia was
   associated with increased mortality compared with FQ-sensitive GNR
   bacteremia, even after adjustment for underlying disease severity,
   conditioning regimen, and age at transplantation (hazard ratio, 2.11;
   95\% CI, 1.06 to 4.23). On average, rates of FQ-resistant GNR bacteremia
   have not significantly changed over 10 years of FQ prophylaxis, although
   FQ-resistant GNR bacteremia is associated with increased mortality
   compared with FQ-sensitive GNR bacteremia. (C) 2015 American Society for

Title = {{Is outdoor work associated with elevated rates of cerebrovascular
   disease mortality? A cohort study based on iron-ore mining}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE AND TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{AUG 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: A cohort study that examined iron ore mining found negative
   associations between cumulative working time employed underground and
   several outcomes, including mortality of cerebrovascular diseases. In
   this cohort study, and using the same group of miners, we examined
   whether work in an outdoor environment could explain elevated
   cerebrovascular disease rates.
   Methods: This study was based on a Swedish iron ore mining cohort
   consisting of 13,000 workers. Poisson regression models were used to
   generate smoothed estimates of standardized mortality ratios and
   adjusted rate ratios, both models by cumulative exposure time in outdoor
   work.
   Results: The adjusted rate ratio between employment classified as
   outdoor work >= 25 years and outdoor work 0-4 years was 1.62 (95 \% CI
   1.07-2.42). The subgroup underground work >= 15 years deviated most in
   occurrence of cerebrovascular disease mortality compared with the
   external reference population: SMR (0.70 (95 \% CI 0.56-0.85)).
   Conclusions: Employment in outdoor environments was associated with
   elevated rates of cerebrovascular disease mortality. In contrast, work
   in tempered underground employment was associated with a protecting
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{Shear band (SB), axial, lateral and volumetric strains as well as
   Poisson's ratio of anisotropic jointed rock specimen (JRS) were modeled
   by Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC). Failure criterion of
   rock was a composited Mohr-Coulomb criterion with tension cut-off. An
   inclined joint was treated as square elements of ideal plastic material
   beyond the peak strength. Several FISH functions were written to
   automatically find the addresses of elements in the joint and to
   calculate the entire deformational characteristics of plane strain JRS.
   The results show that for moderate joint inclination (JI), strain is
   only concentrated into the joint governing the behavior of JRS, leading
   to ideal plastic responses in axial and lateral directions. For higher
   JI, the post-peak stress-axial and lateral strain curves become steeper
   as JI increases owing to the increase of new SB's length. Lateral
   expansion and precursor to the unstable failure are the most apparent,
   resulting in the highest Poisson's ratio and even negative volumetric
   strain. For lower JI, the entire post-peak deformational characteristics
   are independent of JI. The lowest lateral expansion occurs, leading to
   the lowest Poisson's ratio and positive volumetric strain all along. The
   present prediction on anisotropic strength in plane strain compression
   qualitatively agrees with the results in triaxial tests of rocks. The JI
   calculated by Jaeger's formula overestimates that related to the minimum
   strength. Advantages of the present numerical model over the Jaeger's
   model are pointed out.}},

Abstract = {{Exact solution for long orthotropic tube under internal pressure and
   axial load suggests the existence of very dangerous combinations of
   elastic properties. We demonstrate that such elastic properties can be
   thermodynamically stable. Close to a dangerous combination, stress
   components change very rapidly in radial direction, resulting in huge
   peak stresses exceeding the membrane theory predictions by several
   orders of magnitude, even for relatively thin-walled tubes. Another
   manifestation of this effect is extreme sensitivity of peak stresses to
   variations in elastic properties. Away from the critical condition the
   anomaly in stress distribution disappears and this can be the key point
   in the design of related structures. The rapid change of stresses in
   thickness direction is attributed to the auxetic property (negative
   Poisson's ratio) of highly anisotropic material of the tube. As an
   example, we consider the filament wound tube with closed ends under
   internal pressure and demonstrate that, for highly anisotropic
   fiber-reinforced plastic, winding with angle close to 45A degrees is
   potentially dangerous.}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{This work aims to analyze the damping response of viscoelastic composite
   reinforced by elastic auxetic heterogeneities by means of
   micromechanical modeling. The linear viscoelastic problem can be
   transformed into the associated elastic one via the Carson-Laplace
   transform (C-LT). Loss factors are taken into account by the
   introduction of the frequency-dependent complex stiffness tensors of the
   viscoelastic phases. The micromechanical formalism, based on the
   kinematic integral equation, leads to the computation of effective
   storage modulus and its associated loss factor in the quasi-static
   domain. The possibility to enhance viscoelastic (VE) properties of a
   polymeric material such as PVB is examined through several mixing
   configurations. Thus, the use of elastic auxetic heterogeneities is
   analyzed in comparison with classical elastic and viscoelastic
   reinforcements. The model predictions for VE phases, confirm the
   possibility to improve the global material stiffness. Also, it is shown
   in the particular case of elastic and spherical heterogeneities, by a
   proper choice of phases' stiffness ratio Q, that auxetic reinforcements
   represent a good compromise to have simultaneously enhanced stiffness
   and loss factor response in composite materials. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Model based heritability scores for high-throughput sequencing data}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{MAR 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Heritability of a phenotypic or molecular trait measures the
   proportion of variance that is attributable to genotypic variance. It is
   an important concept in breeding and genetics. Few methods are available
   for calculating heritability for traits derived from high-throughput
   sequencing.
   Results: We propose several statistical models and different methods to
   compute and test a heritability measure for such data based on linear
   and generalized linear mixed effects models. We also provide methodology
   for hypothesis testing and interval estimation. Our analyses show that,
   among the methods, the negative binomial mixed model (NB-fit), compound
   Poisson mixed model (CP-fit), and the variance stabilizing transformed
   linear mixed model (VST) outperform the voom-transformed linear mixed
   model (voom). NB-fit and VST appear to be more robust than CP-fit for
   estimating and testing the heritability scores, while NB-fit is the most
   computationally expensive. CP-fit performed best in terms of the
   coverage of the confidence intervals. In addition, we applied the
   methods to both microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing
   datasets from a recombinant inbred mouse panel. We show that miRNA and
   mRNA expression can be a highly heritable molecular trait in mouse, and
   that some top heritable features coincide with expression quantitative
   trait loci.
   Conclusions: The models and methods we investigated in this manuscript
   is applicable and extendable to sequencing experiments where some
   biological replicates are available and the environmental variation is
   properly controlled. The CP-fit approach for assessing heritability was
   implemented for the first time to our knowledge. All the methods
   presented, as well as the generation of simulated sequencing data under
   either negative binomial or compound Poisson mixed models, are provided
   in the R package HeritSeq.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a comprehensive drain current model has been developed for
   long channel Negative Capacitance Germanium Double Gate p-type Field
   Effect Transistor (NCGe-DG-pFET) by using 1-D Poisson's equation and
   Landau-Khalatnikov equation. The model takes into account interface trap
   charges and by using the derived model various parameters such as
   surface potential, gain, gate capacitance, subthreshold swing, drain
   current, transconductance, output conductance and I-on/I-off ratio have
   been obtained and it is demonstrated that by incorporating ferroelectric
   material as gate insulator with Ge-channel, subthreshold swing values
   less than 60 mV/dec can be achieved along with improved gate
   controllability and current drivability. Further, to critically analyze
   the advantages offered by NCGe-DG-pFET, a detailed comparison has been
   done with Germanium Double Gate p-type Field Effect Transistor
   (Ge-DG-pFET) and it is shown that NCGe-DG-pFET exhibits high gain,
   enhanced transport efficiency in channel, very less or negligible
   degradation in device characteristics due to interface trap charges as
   compared to Ge-DG-pFET. The analytical results so obtained show good
   agreement with simulated results obtained from Silvaco ATLAS TCAD tool.

Abstract = {{A new two dimensional carbon allotrope TPDH-graphene
   (Tetra-Penta-Deca-Hexagonal-graphene) belonging to the
   tetragonal-pentagonal carbon ring family is proposed in this work using
   density-functional method. The allotrope satisfies all the conditions of
   structural stability. This allotrope has lower cohesive energy than many
   existing planar carbon allotropes. It can withstand temperature as high
   as 1000 K without loosing its structural integrity. However, its
   electronic structure reflects metallic character due to delocalised p,
   orbital near the Fermi level. Further, this mechanically stable
   elastically anisotropic structure shows directional variation of
   In-plane Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. It is stronger than
   graphene in a particular direction. Moreover, The material can be
   identified by four characteristic peaks in the electron energy loss
   spectra within 10 eV energy. It has optical reflectance peaks in the
   visible range at similar to 600 nm yellow colour. Interestingly, some
   nanoribbons of this material show semimetallic, semiconducting and
   metallic behaviour. Non-equilibrium Green's function method along with
   density-functional theory is employed to study the nanodevices made of
   these nanoribbons. Strong current regulation property and robust
   negative differential resistance effect with a peak-to-valley ratio 3.3
   are observed in two nanodevices making TPDH-graphene an attractive
   material for use in nanoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an empirical inquiry into the applicability of
   zero-altered counting processes to roadway section accident frequencies.
   The intent of such a counting process is to distinguish sections of
   roadway that are truly safe (near zero-accident likelihood) from those
   that are unsafe but happen to have zero accidents observed during the
   period of observation (e.g. one year). Traditional applications of
   Poisson and negative binomial accident frequency models do not account
   for this distinction and thus can produce biased coefficient estimates
   because of the preponderance of zero-accident observations. Zero-altered
   probability processes such as the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and
   zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distributions are examined and
   proposed for accident frequencies by roadway functional class and
   geographic location. The findings show that the ZIP structure models are
   promising and have great flexibility in uncovering processes affecting
   accident frequencies on roadway sections observed with zero accidents
   and those with observed accident occurrences. This flexibility allows
   highway engineers to better isolate design factors that contribute to
   accident occurrence and also provides additional insight into variables
   that determine the relative accident likelihoods of safe versus unsafe
   roadways. The generic nature of the models and the relatively good power
   of the Vuong specification test used in the non-nested hypotheses of
   model specifications offers roadway designers the potential to develop a
   global family of models for accident frequency prediction that can be
   embedded in a larger safety management system. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Cumulative sum control charts have been used for health surveillance due
   to its efficiency to detect soon small shifts in the monitored series.
   However, these charts may fail when data are autocorrelated. An
   alternative procedure is to build a control chart based on the residuals
   after fitting autoregressive moving average models, but these models
   usually assume Gaussian distribution for the residuals. In practical
   health surveillance, count series can be modeled by Poisson or Negative
   Binomial regression, this last to control overdispersion. To include
   serial correlations, generalized autoregressive moving average models
   are proposed. The main contribution of the current article is to measure
   the impact, in terms of average run length on the performance of
   cumulative sum charts when the serial correlation is neglected in the
   regression model. Different statistics based on transformations, the
   deviance residual, and the likelihood ratio are used to build cumulative
   sum control charts to monitor counts with time varying means, including
   trend and seasonal effects. The monitoring of the weekly number of
   hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases for people aged over 65
   years in the city SAo Paulo-Brazil is considered as an illustration of
   the current method.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structural materials show distinctive properties by exhibiting a
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). When these structures are subjected to
   uniaxial loading, they expand in tension and contract in compression in
   both loading and lateral directions. In this paper, two AlSi12
   re-entrant honeycomb samples were manufactured using direct metal
   printing (DMP). Quasi-static uniaxial tension was executed in both X and
   Y direction. A Digital VIC-2D Image Correlation System was used to
   record the deformation history. Force and displacement were measured by
   ZWICK machine. The results show that loading direction has a significant
   effect on the mechanical properties and auxeticity of the tested
   structure. Re-entrant honeycomb under X-loading withstand lower force
   and has smaller magnitude of Poisson's ratio compared with that under
   Y-loading.}},

   have been widely used in the design of mechanical metamaterials.
   Changing the geometrical parameters of these unit cell structures, their
   overall elastic properties (i.e., elastic stiffness and Poisson's
   ratio), can be simultaneously tuned. Therefore, different design
   strategies (e.g., functional gradient) can be implemented to design
   advanced engineering materials with unusual properties. Here, using the
   theory of elasticity and finite element modeling, we propose a fast and
   direct approach to effectively design the microarchitectures of
   mechanical metamaterials with re-entrant structures that allow
   predicting complex deformation shapes under uniaxial tensile loading. We
   also analyze the efficiency of this method by back calculating the
   microarchitectural designs of mechanical metamaterials to predict the
   complex 1-D external contour of objects (e.g., vase and foot). The
   proposed approach has several applications in creating programmable
   mechanical metamaterials with shape matching properties for exoskeletal
   and soft robotic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal design of porous and periodic microstructures through topology
   identification of the associated periodic unit cell (PUC) constitutes
   the topic of this work. Here, the attention is confined to two-phase
   heterogeneous materials in which the topology identification of
   manufacturable 3D-PUC is conducted by means of a topology optimization
   technique. The associated objective function is coupled with 3D
   numerical homogenization approach that connects the elastic properties
   of the 3D-PUC to the target product. The topology optimization
   methodology that is adopted in this study is the combination of solid
   isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method and optimality
   criteria algorithm (OCA), referred to as SIMP-OCA methodology. The
   fairly simple SIMP-OCA is then generalized to handle the topology design
   of 3D manufacturable microstructures of cubic and orthotropic symmetry.
   The performance of the presented methodology is experimentally validated
   by fabricating real prototypes of extremal elastic constants using
   additive manufacturing. Experimental evaluation is performed on two
   designed microstructures: an orthotropic sample with Young's moduli
   ratios E-2/E-1 = 2.5, E-3/E-1 = 2 and a cubic sample with negative
   Poisson's ratio of -0.19. In all practical examples studied, laboratory
   measurements are in reasonable agreement with the prescribed values;
   thus, corroborating the applicability of the proposed methodology.}},

   by spin-polarized Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) within
   Density Functional Theory (DFT). To make extensive study within ab
   initio methods, after the optimization process to get optimal structural
   parameters in most suitable magnetic phase, the electronic band
   structures with the total density of electronic states and second order
   elastic constants to predict some thermal and elastic features have been
   calculated. The calculated negative formation enthalpy values indicate
   that, our materials are thermodynamically stable and structurally
   synthesizable. The observed minority (down) band gaps in the calculated
   electronic band structures, E-g = 2.62 eV for Zn3VS4 and E-g = 1.75 eV
   for Zn3VTe4, show that our crystal systems have half-metallic character.
   Also, the calculated elastic constants prove that our compounds are
   mechanically stable due to satisfy the Born-Huang criteria. Moreover,
   the anisotropic elastic properties have been visualized in
   two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) surfaces for Young's

   structure-structure coupling. Based on the linear hygroelasticity
   theory, the governing state equations in terms of displacements and
   moisture concentration are acquired. At first, the Fickian equation is
   solved to compute the nonlinear distribution of moisture through the
   plate thickness, and then the state equations are semi-analytically
   solved using the state-space (SS) method and the differential quadrature
   (DQ) rule to predict the elastic field quantities. A comprehensive
   parametric analysis is accomplished to elucidate the effects of key
   parameters on the steady-state response of the plate under the

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials, which possess a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), have
   been a hot topic in materials science research. Through atomistic
   simulations, we theoretically rediscover a few novel two-dimensional
   (2D) V-A-nitride (V-A-N) binary compounds with delta-phosphorene-like
   structures. The structures in the delta-phase (except for delta-PN)
   exhibit better stability in terms of energy, thermodynamics, and
   mechanics with respect to their counterparts in the alpha- and
   beta-phases. The structures in the delta-phase show semiconducting
   behaviors with direct band gaps falling in the visible light region.
   Interestingly, most structures in the alpha- and delta-phases (except
   for delta-BiN) exhibit large in-plane NPRs and excellent mechanical
   properties. The maximum NPR occurs along the zigzag (x) direction for
   the delta-phases and along the diagonal direction for the alpha-phases.
   Particularly, for alpha- and delta-SbN, the NPRs are -0.628 and -0.296,
   respectively. delta-SbN can sustain tensile strains of up to 22\% and
   35\% with maximum stresses of 12.1 and 9.8 GPa in the zigzag and
   armchair directions, respectively. In addition, the transverse response
   can reach up to 6.6\% at a strain of similar to 18\% along the armchair
   (y) direction for delta-SbN, which is considerably higher than those of
   other 2D auxetic materials. Our results reveal that 2D V-A-N binary
   compounds have potential applications in designing 2D electromechanical
   and optoelectronic devices.}},

Title = {{Broadband radar absorption and mechanical behaviors of bendable

Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{162}},

Abstract = {{When over-expanded, the hexagonal honeycomb (HH) turns to bendable
   quadrilateral honeycomb. The ove-rexpanded honeycomb (OH) is
   anisotropic. In-plane crushing behaviors of the OH were revealed by
   experiments. Compressed along arm-chair direction, the OH has three
   deformation modes, turning from quadrilateral honeycomb, re-entrant
   hexagonal honeycomb to triangular honeycomb. The Poisson's ratio turns
   from zero, negative to positive. Compressed along the beeline direction,
   the OH is crushed at shear buckling band. The equivalent strength and
   modulus change with the compression direction and consistently predicted
   by structural models. Coated with carbon powder based absorbing
   material, the OH turns to a multifunctional material. The microwave
   absorbing behavior changes with the relative density and the thickness
   of the OH. Oblique incidence promotes the microwave absorption and it is
   suggested that the incident angle should not be larger than 45 degrees.
   Pasting GFRC skin, the OH-core sandwich panel still has excellent radar
   absorption but it will be decreased when the skin is thickening. Through
   the research, radar absorbing OH has the capabilities of load bearing
   and electromagnetic energy absorbing. Furthermore, the OH is bendable
   along arm-chair direction and convenient to make cylindrical sandwich
   shell.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials are complexes of elements that can create properties not
   found in naturally occurring materials, such as changing the direction
   of forces, creating negative stiffness, or altering vibration and impact
   properties. In the case of wood pile metamaterials that are easy to
   manufacture and have excellent performance in reducing vibration and
   shock in the vertical direction, basic research on variables affecting
   shock transmission is needed to reduce shock. Although research on
   impact reduction according to geometrical factors is being conducted
   recently, studies on the effect of material variables on impact
   reduction are insufficient. In this paper, finite element analysis was
   carried out by variablizing the geometrical properties (lamination
   angle, diameter, length) and material properties (modulus of elasticity,
   specific gravity, Poisson's ratio) of wood pile cylinders. Through
   finite element analysis, the shape of the wooden pile cylinder
   delivering impact was confirmed, and the effect of each variable on the
   reduction of impact force and energy was considered through main effect
   diagram analysis, and frequency band analysis was performed through fast
   Fourier transform. proceeded In order to reduce the impact force and
   vibration, it was found that the variables affecting the contact area
   oft he cylinder have a significant effect.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical solutions for the elastic properties of a variety of binary
   nanotubes with arbitrary chirality are obtained through the study of
   systematic molecular mechanics. This molecular mechanics model is first
   extended to chiral binary nanotubes by introducing an additional
   out-of-plane inversion term into the so-called stick-spiral model, which
   results from the polar bonds and the buckling of binary graphitic
   crystals. The closed-form expressions for the longitudinal and
   circumferential Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of chiral binary
   nanotubes are derived as functions of the tube diameter. The obtained
   inversion force constants are negative for all types of binary
   nanotubes, and the predicted tube stiffness is lower than that by the
   former stick-spiral model without consideration of the inversion term,
   reflecting the softening effect of the buckling on the elastic
   properties of binary nanotubes. The obtained properties are shown to be
   comparable to available density functional theory calculated results and
   to be chirality and size sensitive. The developed model and explicit
   solutions provide a systematic understanding of the mechanical
   performance of binary nanotubes consisting of III-V and II-VI group
   elements.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic study on the influence of the cell geometry of a
   cardiovascular stent on its radial compliance and longitudinal strain is
   presented. Eight stent cell geometries-based on common lattice cells-are
   compared using finite element analysis. It is found that, for a given
   strut thickness, the radial compliance depends on the shape of the cell
   and is intimately connected with the longitudinal strain through
   effective Poisson's ratio, which depends on the cell geometry. It is
   demonstrated experimentally that a hybrid stent containing both positive
   and negative Poisson's ratio cell lattice geometries exhibited very low
   values of longitudinal strain. This study indicates that cell geometries
   may be tailored to minimize longitudinal stresses imposed by the stent

Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior of electromagneic materials is usually sensitive
   to the electric, magnetic as well as temperature field. It is found by
   the experiments in this paper that the grads of the non-uniform electric
   field can increase or decrease the speed of the heat conduction in
   conductors, and the environment temperature and the varying-time
   excitation magnetic field have obvious influence on the strain of the
   giant magnetostrictive materials. Our theoretical prediction on the
   induced body and boundary forces in ferromagnetic materials and on the
   constitutive behavior of the giant magnetostrictive materials also
   exhibited a strong effect of multi-field coupling, which makes the
   mechanical responses of electromagnetic materials are very different
   from the uncoupling ones. Furthermore, our theoretical investigations
   show that the effect of the multi-field coupling is not only in
   macroscales but also in microscales. For the elastic properties of
   nanowires, it is found in this paper that the negative pressure on the
   surfaces stemmed from the transverse electric field modifies the Young's
   modulus and Poisson's ratio of nanowires significantly. The relative
   change of elastic properties is also strongly dependent on the diameter
   of nanowires.}},

Title = {{The impact of mandating a driving lesson for elderly drivers in Japan
   using count data models: Case study of Toyota City}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{153}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{As one crucial mobility problem for elderly drivers, vehicle crashes due
   to elderly drivers account for an increased ratio of total vehicle
   crashes in recent years in Japan. Mandating a driving lesson for elderly
   drivers was implemented and revised continuously to reduce the number of
   vehicle crashes. To perform a practical driving lesson for elderly
   drivers, it is essential to evaluate whether it can reduce vehicle
   crashes significantly or not. Most previous studies only investigated
   its effects on fatal or severe rates using rather simple methods,
   without consideration for the increasing number of elderly drivers and
   the variability of vehicle crashes in different months. To bridge these
   research gaps, this study examines the impact of mandating a driving
   lesson for elderly drivers by some advanced statistical methods based on
   a monthly level. Vehicle crash records from April 2005 to December 2019
   collected in Toyota City, Japan are used for empirical analysis. Three
   types of count data models, i.e., the Poisson regression model, the
   Negative Binomial regression model, and the Poisson Integer Valued
   Autoregressive (INAR) (1) model are proposed in this study. A comparison
   of three proposed models was implemented to indicate the similarity and
   distinction of estimation results. The significant findings of this
   study suggest that: 1) three proposed models have the same prediction
   accuracy referring to indexes of Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute
   Error, and Mean Squared Error; 2) all of them indicate that the revision
   of license renewal legislation for elderly drivers in March 2017 is a
   significant factor negatively affecting the number of vehicle crashes at
   a 10 \% significance level; 3) all of them indicate that the number of
   drivers aged 65 years or older and month-variability are significant
   factors affecting the number of vehicle crashes at least a 10 \%
   significance level; 4) the time-series nature of vehicle crashes due to
   elderly drivers was not existing indicated by the result of the Poisson
   INAR (1) model. Statistical methods proposed in this study can be
   referred by researchers and engineers to evaluate the effects of traffic
   safety measures in the research field of traffic and transportation
   engineering.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{292}},
Month = {{JUL 19}},
Abstract = {{Plastic due to its versatility, lighter weight and durability properties
   has become an essential part of human lives. The global plastic
   production is growing significantly every year; while the amount of
   plastic being effectively recycled is comparatively low, imposing
   negative impacts on the environment and sustainability. Recently many
   efforts have been made to develop effective means for the consumption of
   plastic waste to diminish its environmental impact. In this regard, the
   incorporation of plastic waste, as received or shredded plastic
   particles (direct) or plastic-based synthetic aggregates (indirect) in
   concrete as a replacement for natural aggregate has been studied
   extensively in last few decades.
   The current paper put forwards a comprehensive and detailed review of
   the previous studies conducted to evaluate the effect of sustainable
   synthetic aggregate replacement on the fresh, hardened, physical and
   durability related properties of the resulting concrete. The difference
   in the direct and indirect replacement of plastic on the workability,
   fresh and dry density, mechanical strengths, modulus of elasticity,
   Poisson's ratio, failure mechanism, abrasion resistance, micro structure
   analysis, drying shrinkage, creep, fire resistance, thermal
   conductivity, water absorption and chloride ion penetration are
   presented in the current paper.

Abstract = {{The selection of materials for semiconductor device passivation was
   investigated as regards the application of ZnO- and PbO-based glasses in
   MOS (metal, oxide, and silicon) devices. It was found that mechanisms
   affecting the application of these glasses to MOS devices were related
   to the molar polarizabilities and the OH radical contents in glasses.
   With regard to the recovery of C-V (capacitance-voltage) hysteresis
   loops in MOS capacitors, ZnO-based glasses were found to be superior to
   PbO-based glasses, since the molar polarizability of ZnO-based glasses
   was smaller than that of PbO-based glasses. The concentration of OH
   radicals depends on the composition of the glasses and had a negative
   effect on the recovery of C-V curve shifts in MOS capacitors passivated
   by these glasses. The glasses had low-temperature reflow below 800
   degrees C; PbO-based glasses had lower flow points than ZnO-based
   glasses. The possible mechanisms for the recovery of <Delta Vover
   bar(G)> shifts in C-V hysteresis loops were elucidated by the use of
   Poisson's equation and OH absorption coefficients. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{The present models used for the calculation of creep could not describe
   the behaviour of materials. Therefore a reliable, detailed and
   material-based simulation of the material behaviour under the load is
   not possible. In this article, some phenomenological models, which are
   based on the invariant theory and contain all three invariants of the
   stress tensor, for the description of 3D creep of non-reinforced
   thermoplastics are discussed.
   These models describe the combination of potentials depending on the
   sign of the first stress invariant. Depending on the selected model, the
   transition from negative to positive range could be continuous or
   continuously differentiable. For the negative first invariant range the
   material is assumed to be incompressible.
   The applicability of these models is studied by comparing the measured
   viscoelastic POISSON's ratio. It is shown that, for the application
   having at least two experimentally defined parameters, a wide range of
   material characteristics can be described.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Chiral honeycombs are one of the most important and oft studied classes
   of auxetic systems due to their vast number of potential applications
   which range from stent geometries to composites, sensors and satellite
   components. Despite numerous works on these systems, however, relatively
   few studies have investigated the effect of structural disorder on these
   structures. In view of this, in this study, the effect of translational
   disorder on hexachiral honeycombs were investigated through a Finite
   Element approach. It was found that this type of disorder has minimal
   effect on the Poisson's ratios of these systems provided that the
   ligament length to thickness ratio remains sufficiently large and the
   overall length to width ratio of the disordered system does not differ
   considerably from that of its ordered counterpart. This makes it ideal
   for use in various applications and products such as sandwich composites
   with an auxetic core. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Capability of achieving desired thermal expansions is critically
   important for various engineering applications. Inspired by the
   morphable kirigami patterns, three-dimensional (3D) mechanical
   metamaterials are designed and fabricated with their effective thermal
   expansion properties being coded within the fundamental
   thermo-mechanical coupled microstructures. With the concept of `bit'
   being introduced in the basic quarter unit, we construct ring-like unit
   cells which are assembled to form different 2D and 3D metamaterials with
   programmable elastic deformations upon changes in temperature. Both
   simulations and experiments are performed at different levels of the
   architectured materials indicating that the targeted isotropic and
   anisotropic deformations can be achieved in a large range (from -40\% to
   10\% strain). Finally, the positively correlated relation between
   thermal expansion property and Poisson's ratio is also discussed. This
   work opens up new avenues for potential mechanical metamaterial
   applications in deformable electronics, self-folding materials,

Abstract = {{We develop a fast proximal gradient scheme for reconstructing
   nonnegative signals that are sparse in a transform domain from
   underdetermined measurements. This signal model is motivated by
   tomographic applications where the signal of interest is known to be
   nonnegative because it represents a tissue or material density. We adopt
   the unconstrained regularization framework where the objective function
   to be minimized is a sum of a convex data fidelity (negative
   log-likelihood (NLL)) term and a regularization term that imposes signal
   nonnegativity and sparsity via an `1-norm constraint on the signal's
   transform coefficients. This objective function is minimized via
   Nesterov's proximal-gradient method with function restart, where the
   proximal mapping is computed via alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM). To accelerate the convergence, we develop an
   adaptive continuation scheme and a step-size selection scheme that
   accounts for varying local Lipschitz constant of the NLL. In the
   numerical examples, we consider Gaussian linear and Poisson generalized
   linear measurement models. We compare the proposed penalized NLL
   minimization approach and existing signal reconstruction methods via
   compressed sensing and tomographic reconstruction experiments and
   demonstrate that, by exploiting both the nonnegativity of the underlying
   signal and sparsity of its wavelet coefficients, we can achieve
   significantly better reconstruction performance than the existing
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms behind the load building capabilities of a hyperbranched
   polymer (HBP) in polyurethane (PU) foams have been investigated, using
   microscopy techniques and mechanical analyses. By broadening the
   traditional uniaxial compression characterization of PU foams to include
   combined shear deformations and compression behavior, an apparent
   Poisson ratio of the foam could be obtained in situ. The Poisson ratio
   as function of uniaxial compression ratio of the foam was thus studied
   for foams filled with Styrene Acrylonitrile (SAN) and foams containing
   HBP. Generally a window of deformation ratios could be defined in which
   the Poisson ratio was negative. The width of this window varied
   systematically with the SAN loading, where an increase in SAN particle
   loading resulted in a broadening of the negative Poisson ratio window.

Abstract = {{In this work, we report on the fabrication and characterization of a
   buckling system constituted by square array holes able to modify its
   structural configuration and its optical response as a function of the
   applied force. Herein, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) auxetic structures
   are fabricated by means of 3D printing mold and casting/peeling off
   steps. From a mechanical point of view, it has been demonstrated that
   the structure presents a transformation to a strikingly different
   pattern of alternating mutually orthogonal ellipses above a nominal
   force of 23 N, a clear signature of the auxetic structures behavior.
   This feature has been exploited to create a reversible and sensitive
   optical force sensor, that makes use of the variation on the light
   intensity or its optical rotation (theta) upon application of a force.
   In fact, it has been demonstrated that the application of the force
   induces a variation of the refractive index of the auxetic system,
   associated to the presence of stress. For the structure realized a
   sensitivity of about Delta(Delta theta)/Delta F = 0.033 rad/N in the
   range between 23 N and 28 N has been determined.
   Finally, the presented study suggests that it is possible to realize a
   sensitive and reversible optical force sensor taking advantages of the
   peculiar features of buckling periodic elastic materials.}},

Abstract = {{For many decades, it has been challenging to synthesize auxetic
   materials at the molecular level. Auxetic materials exhibit
   counterintuitive behavior; they expand perpendicularly to the direction
   in which they are stretched. An aromatic macrocycle containing a
   sequence of N-substituted and N-unsubstituted amides was designed to
   resemble the re-entrant structure found in macromolecular auxetic
   materials. Upon application of tensile force, bent cis amides change to
   linear trans amides. This was anticipated to trigger the expansion of
   the macrocycle perpendicular to the direction of the applied force. To
   investigate the proposed configurational change by atom force microscopy
   (AFM), we designed and prepared a cis-trans aramide motif incorporated
   into an end-functionalized polymer which ensured covalent attachment to
   the AFM tip. At large extensions, polymer chains were envisioned to
   unfold and induce cis-trans isomerization.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Thanks to the presence of a transverse magnetic flux density (B-x and
   B-y where z is the extraction axis), the undesired extraction of
   electrons from a negative ion source is reduced and it is due to
   collisions. The electron transport is studied with a kinetic model,
   including Vlasov-Poisson effects and atomic collisions. The
   integrodifferential equations (IDE) resulting from a reduction to a
   one-dimensional problem (1-D) by integration on characteristic orbits
   are strongly affected by the trapped orbits, as here evaluated; a kernel
   calculation with a partial wave approximation is introduced.
   Dependencies from the local drift velocity v(d) and effective Larmor
   radius L-e are found. Solutions are investigated in simple cases with a
   constant electron current (no additional electron production).
   Equilibrium solution and electron conductivity are analytically
   obtained. Presheath solutions are discussed; the approximated conversion
   to differential equations that are adequate for presheath only (with
   moderated electric field gradient E-z,E-z > -eB(x)(2)/m) and their
   numeric solutions coupled to Poisson equation are reported, and compared
   to iterative IDE solutions. Examples with different values of L-e and
   mean free path (mfp) ratio are described.}},

Title = {{On anisotropic versions of three-dimensional pentamode metamaterials}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Pentamode materials are artificial solids with elastic properties that
   approximate those of isotropic liquids. The corresponding
   three-dimensional mechanical metamaterials or `meta-liquids' have
   recently been fabricated. In contrast to normal liquids, anisotropic
   meta-liquids are also possible-a prerequisite for realizing many of the
   envisioned transformation-elastodynamics architectures. Here, we study
   several possibilities theoretically for introducing intentional
   anisotropy into three-dimensional pentamode metamaterials. In static
   continuum mechanics, the transition from anti-auxetic pentamode
   materials to auxetics is possible. Near this transition, in the dynamic
   case, approximately uniaxial versions of pentamode metamaterials deliver
   anisotropic longitudinal-wave phase velocities different by nearly a
   factor of 10 for realistically accessible microstructure parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The transport theory of ions and electrons in an oscillating electric
   field, typically at radio frequencies, is of interest both as a problem
   in basic physics and for its potential for application to modern
   technology, e.g., plasma processing. Our research has been motivated by
   both these considerations, but the present paper concerns theory and
   focuses on Boltzmann's kinetic equation in particular. We note that as
   far as kinetic theory is concerned, any substantial advances on the
   pioneering work of Margenau and Hartmann nearly fifty years ago have
   been remarkably limited in comparison with the extensive, systematic
   development of d.c. transport theory over the past two decades. Our goal
   has been to develop a comprehensive theory of a.c. charged particle
   transport, at a level of sophistication comparable with the d.c. theory,
   and the first steps are reported in the present paper, which deals with
   theoretical foundations and phenomenology. After examining the broader
   implications of space-time symmetries, namely, parity and phase-reversal
   invariance, we proceed through low-order moments of Boltzmann's
   equation, with collision terms approximated in the same way as for d.c.
   momentum-transfer theory, and look for relationships, however
   approximate, connecting experimentally measurable quantities, and
   otherwise attempt to shed light on transport phenomena peculiar to
   harmonically varying electric fields. In this way we obtain: (a) A full
   set of momentum-energy balance equations for both ions and electrons, to
   be solved simultaneously with Poisson's equation where appropriate; (b)
   A generalisation of Wannier's energy relation for ion swarms in an a.c.
   field; (c) Generalised Einstein relations for cycle-averaged electron
   swarm diffusion coefficients; (d) information about a.c. negative
   differential conductivity and the anomalous character of anisotropic
   diffusion in a.c. fields; (e) A procedure for adaptation of d.c.
   experimental swarm data to a.c. swarms and r.f discharges. The
   discussion is at the semiquantitative level, with emphasis on physical
   understanding. (C) 1997 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated pest management programs for soybean (Glycine max (L.)
   Merrill) must be based on efficient sampling plans for estimating the
   pest population. Based on the spatial distribution of the Neotropical
   brown stink bug Euschistus heros (Fabricius, 1794) found on soybean, it
   was possible to construct a sequential sampling plan for the survey of
   this insect found on soybean. The experiment was carried out during two
   growing seasons, 2010/2011 and 2011/2012, using the transgenic soybean
   cultivar M 7908 RR, in plots of 10,000 m(2) subdivided into 100 plots of
   100 m(2) (10 m x 10 m). Nymphs > 0.5 cm (4th and 5th instars) plus
   adults were counted weekly from five drop cloth technique samplings per
   plot. To evaluate insect dispersion in the area, the following indices
   were used: variance/mean ratio, Morisita's index, Green's coefficient,
   the k exponent of the negative binomial distribution, and estimation of
   the common exponent k (kc). To study probabilistic models to describe
   the spatial distribution of the insects, adjustments of the Poisson and
   negative binomial distributions were tested. Two sequential sampling
   plans for separate fields, one for grain production and the other for
   seed production, were prepared. The data fitted a negative binomial
   distribution and a sampling plan was drawn up using the sequential
   likelihood ratio test (SLRT). The maximum sampling unit number expected
   for control-related decision making was six in grain production fields,
   and nine in seed production fields.}},

Abstract = {{We combine 3D printing technique, numerical analysis, and experiments to
   design a new class of sandwich composites that exhibit various bending
   behaviors. These programmed sandwich structures contain 3D printed core
   materials with truss, conventional honeycomb, and re-entrant honeycomb
   topologies. Three-point bending tests are performed to investigate the
   bending behavior of these sandwich composites with two types of carbon
   fiber reinforced polymer face sheets. Under bending deformation,
   sandwich composites with truss core materials provide highest flexural
   stiffness and strength that are desirable in structural components. The
   sandwich composites with re-entrant honeycomb core exhibit a sequential
   snap-through instability which significantly enhances the energy
   absorption abilities. Our experimental and numerical results indicate
   that architected core structures can be utilized to tailor the bending
   properties as well as failure mechanisms. These findings offer new
   insights into the study of nonlinear mechanical response of sandwich
   structures, which can benefit a wide range of industries and

Title = {{Effects of morphology and orientation on the behavior of two-dimensional
   hexagonal foams and application in a re-entrant foam anchor model}},

Year = {{1998}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the elastic behavior of regular (equal strut
   lengths) hexagonal foams, both convex and non-convex (re-entrant).
   Explicit constitutive relations are given based on the unit cell
   geometry and strut material properties. Sensitivity studies show the
   effects of unit cell architecture and loading direction on the
   structural properties of the unit cell. The effect of cell strut angle
   on the structural properties is clarified by considering the change in
   relative density of the foam that is related to changes in the strut
   angles. It is shown that the density varies dramatically with strut
   angle for fixed strut lengths, which significantly effects the
   interpretation of results. An important conclusion regarding the effect
   of foam orientation (or loading direction) is that what has been
   referred to as a negative Poisson's ratio for re-entrant foams is
   actually a negative Poisson's ratio effect. This effect can in fact be
   reversed by simply rotating the foam; for intermediate rotation angles
   the foam may demonstrate a positive Poisson's ratio deformation
   behavior. Hexagonal re-entrant foams do not have a unique value of
   Poisson's ratio since they are anisotropic. For demonstration, the
   elastic re-entrant foam constitutive relations are embedded into a
   finite element model to study a foam anchor between rigid parallel
   walls. The effect of the cell strut angle on the anchoring effectiveness
   of the foam is discussed. Foams with strut angles of 100 degrees and 110
   degrees and equal relative densities are compared, and it is concluded
   that the foam with 100 degrees strut angle provides better anchoring.
   This conclusion is based on the finding that the 100 degrees foam is
   stiffer and has a stronger negative Poisson's ratio (lateral expansion
   under tension) effect than the 110 degrees foam having the same relative
   density. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   under Large Uniaxial Loading}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 4}},
Abstract = {{Anisotropic materials form inside living tissue and are widely applied
   in engineered structures, where sophisticated structural and functional
   design principles are essential to employing these materials. This paper
   presents a candidate laminated open-cell framework, which is an
   anisotropic material that shows remarkable mechanical performance. Using
   additive manufacturing, artificial frameworks are fabricated by
   lamination of in-plane orthotropic microstructures made of elbowed beam
   and column members; this fabricated structure features orthogonal
   anisotropy in three-dimensional space. Uniaxial loading tests reveal
   strong auxeticity (high negative Poisson's ratios) in the out-of-plane
   direction, which is retained reproducibly up to the nonlinear elastic
   region, and is equal under tensile and compressive loading. Finite
   element simulations support the observed auxetic behaviors for a unit
   cell in the periodic framework, which preserve the theoretical elastic
   properties of an orthogonal solid. These findings open the possibility
   of conceptual materials design based on geometry.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing number of protein-based metamaterials demands reliable
   and efficient theoretical and computational methods to study the
   physicochemical properties they may display. In this regard, we develop
   a simulation strategy based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) that addresses
   the geometric degrees of freedom of an auxetic two-dimensional protein
   crystal. This model consists of a network of impenetrable rigid squares
   linked through massless rigid rods. Our MD methodology extends the
   well-known protocols SHAKE and RATTLE to include highly non-linear
   holonomic and non-holonomic constraints, with an emphasis on collision
   detection and response between anisotropic rigid bodies. The presented
   method enables the simulation of long-time dynamics with reasonably
   large time steps. The data extracted from the simulations allow the
   characterization of the dynamical correlations featured by the protein
   subunits, which show a persistent motional interdependence across the
   array. On the other hand, non-holonomic constraints (collisions between
   subunits) increase the number of inhomogeneous deformations of the
   network, thus driving it away from an isotropic response. Our work
   provides the first long-timescale simulation of the dynamics of protein
   crystals and offers insights into promising mechanical properties
   afforded by these materials.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the mechanical behavior of isotropic fibrin networks at the
   macroscopic scale in terms of the nanoscale force response of fibrin
   molecules that are its basic building blocks. We show that the
   remarkable extensibility and compressibility of fibrin networks have
   their origins in the unfolding of fibrin molecules. The force-stretch
   behavior of a single fibrin fiber is described using a two-state model
   in which the fiber has a linear force-stretch relation in the folded
   phase and behaves like a worm-like-chain in the unfolded phase. The
   nanoscale force-stretch response is connected to the macro-scale
   stress-stretch response by means of the eight-chain model. This model is
   able to capture the macroscopic response of a fibrin network in uniaxial
   tension and appears remarkably simple given the molecular complexity. We
   use the eight-chain model to explain why fibrin networks have negative
   compressibility and Poisson's ratio greater than 1 due to unfolding of
   fibrin molecules. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The unique structure of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials
   provides a good energy absorption capacity that has found wide
   application in automotive and aeronautics industries. The present work
   proposes a novel NPR energy absorption structure installed between the
   bumper and anti-collision beam of automobiles for improving pedestrian
   lower leg protection. The performance of the proposed NPR structure
   based on tibia acceleration, knee bending angle, and knee shear
   displacement is evaluated by comparison with the performance of a
   conventional energy absorption structure. The performance of the
   proposed structure is further improved by conducting multi-objective
   design optimization with consideration for the perturbation induced by
   parameter uncertainties. For optimization, a parametric model of the NPR
   structure is first established based on the relationships between
   parameters. To promote computational efficiency, an optimal Latin
   hypercube sampling technique and the dual response surface method are
   combined to build surrogate models between responses and inputs. A
   multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and six sigma
   criteria are then applied to obtain the optimal design parameters of the
   structure. The optimization results are validated by comparisons with
   the results of multi-objective deterministic optimization. The
   comparison results show that the proposed NPR energy absorption
   structure improves pedestrian lower leg protection significantly, and
   its performance is further improved by the proposed multi-objective
   robust design optimization. This study serves as a good example of the
   safety promotion provided by applying NPR structures with enhanced
   energy absorption capacity in vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider interval estimation of the mean in the natural

   For the three discrete cases, the Wald confidence interval and three
   alternative intervals are examined by means of two term Edgeworth
   expansions of the coverage probability and a two term expansion of the
   expected length. The results and additional computation suggest that the
   equal tailed Jeffreys interval and the likelihood ratio interval are the
   best overall alternatives to the Wald interval. We also show that the
   poor performance of the Wald interval is not limited to the discrete
   cases, and a serious negative bias occurs in the nonnormal continuous
   cases as well. The results axe complemented by various illustrative

   increased from 0 to -300V) and the substrate heating (T-s increased from
   room temperature (RT) to 700 degrees C). All TiB2 coatings were measured
   using microhardness tester Fischerscope H100 equipped with Vickers and
   Berkovich diamond indenters and exhibited high values of hardness H-v up

Abstract = {{The thermodynamic, elastic, and electronic properties of D0(22)-type
   Al3V and Al3Nb intermetallics were studied using the first-principle
   method. The results showed the pressure has profound effects on the
   structural, mechanical and electronic properties in both Al3V and Al3Nb.
   Thermodynamically, the formation enthalpies for Al3V and Al3Nb were
   derived, which agreed well with available experimental and theoretical
   values. Comparably, Al3Nb was a more stable phase with the more negative
   H-f than Al3V. Mechanically, the calculated elastic constants showed
   linearly increasing tendencies, and satisfied the Born's criteria from
   0-20 GPa, indicating the mechanically stability of Al3V and Al3Nb under
   this pressure range. Further, the mechanical parameters (i.e., bulk
   modulus (B), shear modulus (G), and Young's modulus (E)) were derived
   using the Voigt-Reuss-Hill (VRH) method, and in good agreement with
   available experimental results at the ground state. All these parameters
   presented the linearly increasing dependences on the external pressure.
   The B/G ratios and Poisson's ratio indicated that the Al3V and Al3Nb
   crystals should exhibit brittle behavior at 0-20 GPa. Additionally, the
   bulk modulus can be obtained through fitting the Birch-Murnaghan
   equation (B-0), computing by VRH method (B-H), and deriving from the
   elastic theory (B-relax) in both intermetallics. The uniformity of these
   calculated bulk moduli in each compound exhibited the excellent
   reliability and self-consistency. In addition, Debye temperature was
   estimated from the average sound velocity. The Debye temperature showed
   an increasing dependence on the pressures. Finally, through density of
   states analysis, Al3V and Al3Nb were suggested to possess naturally
   metallic behavior. Under pressures, it was noted that the shapes of
   peaks and pseudogaps exhibited relative few changes, suggesting Al3V and
   Al3Nb has kept structurally stable up to 20 GPa. At zero pressure, Al3Nb
   was considered as a more structurally stable phase with the more number
   of bonding electrons per atom than Al3V. This conclusion was in
   consistent with the one drawn from the thermodynamic analysis. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Polymer-matrix composites are widely used in various industries due to
   their high specific strength and specific stiffness. However, the void
   formation is inevitable as a by-product during manufacturing processes,
   which may have negative effects on its mechanical properties. The
   purposes of this paper are to quantitatively evaluate the influence of
   voids on the anisotropic elastic properties of composites and to provide
   corresponding theoretical prediction models. Firstly, three-dimensional
   representative volume elements (RVE) of fiber-reinforced composite
   materials with different fiber contents (36.37\%, 45.47\%, 50.92\%) and
   different void contents (1\%, 3\%, 5\%, 7\%) are established. To obtain
   the elastic properties in different directions, various periodic
   boundary conditions are applied to the RVE models and corresponding
   subroutines are developed by ABAQUS-PYTHON. Secondly, a series of
   theoretical models are proposed to quickly predict the anisotropic
   elastic properties of unidirectional fiber/epoxy composites containing
   random-sized void defects, which agree well with the finite element
   simulation results. Especially, the proposed models have concise
   expressions, which require only a few parameters to be input, and hence
   they are convenient for engineering application. Both theoretical and
   numerical results show that void defects have an obvious influence on
   the transverse modulus, major Poisson's ratio, and the out-of-plane
   shear modulus. When the void volume reaches 7\%, all of the properties
   mentioned above decrease by more than 10\% for the FRPs studied.}},

   belt are located at the northeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau. They
   have been thought to play different roles in the eastward expanding of
   the Tibetan Plateau. Peking University deployed a linear seismic array
   across the western end of the Weihe Graben to investigate the crustal
   structures of the tectonic provinces of this structure. Receiver
   function analyses revealed low-to-moderate Poisson's ratios and
   anticorrelations between Poisson's ratios and topography beneath the
   Qinling Orogen. These features may indicate a tectonic thickening of the
   felsic upper crust by folding and thrusting within the Qinling Orogen.
   We observed a strong horizontal negative signal at the midcrust beneath
   the Ordos Plateau which may indicate a low-velocity zone. This
   observation would suggest the stable cratonic Ordos Plateau had been
   modified due to the compression between the Tibetan Plateau and the
   Ordos Plateau. We also observed an abrupt 4km Moho offset across the
   Weihe Fault, changing from similar to 44km beneath the Ordos Plateau to
   similar to 40km beneath the Qinling Orogen. We conclude that the Weihe
   Fault is a lithosphere-scale fault/shear zone, which extends into the
   upper mantle beneath the Weihe Graben. It acts as the major boundary
   separating the stable Ordos Plateau and the active Qinling Orogen.}},

Abstract = {{The present study experimentally investigates adiabatic film cooling
   effectiveness for high performance flow auxetic geometries (S-Slot and
   Ellipsoid). Both geometries are auxetic structures that were designed
   around a Negative Poisson Rao (NPR). Manufactured NPR combustion liners
   offer higher quality fracture resistance {[}1] and high energy
   absorption {[}2]. film cooling effectiveness results for test geometries
   were non-dimensionalized by a baseline case of circular inline orifices.
   Ton-intrusive pressure sensitive paint (PSP) technique was utilized to
   obtain local surface pressure gradients for each experimental geometry.
   Adiabatic film cooling effectiveness measurements were tested for
   multiple blowing ratios (BR) ranging between 0.05-1.15. Three plate
   configurations were studied with inclination angles of 0 degrees.
   Analyses demonstrate that lowing ratios of 0.5 and 0.75 are optimal for
   S-slot adiabatic effectiveness. Film cooling results for the Ellipse
   configuration how increasing effectiveness up to an optimal blowing
   ratio of 0.5, and decreases as BR is increased beyond that. Additional
   experiments were performed by keeping the differential pressure cross
   the plates constant. Results indicate that the S-slot pro ides optimum
   film cooling effectiveness while the differential pressure conserved in
   comparison to Ellipses and Circles.}},

Title = {{Nurse Dose Linking Staffing Variables to Adverse Patient Outcomes}},
Journal = {{NURSING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{214-220}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Inconsistent findings in more than 100 studies have made it
   difficult to explain how variation in nurse staffing affects patient
   outcomes. Nurse dose, defined as the level of nurses required to provide
   patient care in hospital settings, draws on variables used in staffing
   studies to describe the influence of many staffing variables on
   outcomes.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the construct validity
   of nurse dose by determining its association with methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections and reported patient falls on a
   sample of inpatient adult acute care units.
   Methods: Staffing data came from 26 units in Ontario, Canada, and
   Michigan. Financial and human resource data were data sources for
   staffing variables. Sources of data for MRSA came from infection control
   departments. Incident reports were the data source for patient falls.
   Data analysis consisted of bivariate correlations and Poisson
   regression.
   Results: Bivariate correlations revealed that nurse dose attributes
   (active ingredient and intensity) were associated significantly with
   both outcomes. Active ingredient (education, experience, skill mix) and
   intensity (full-time employees, registered nurse {[}RN]:patient ratio,
   RN hours per patient day) were significant predictors of MRSA.
   Coefficients for both attributes were negative and almost identical.
   Both attributes were significant predictors of reported patient falls,
   and coefficients were again negative, but coefficient sizes differed.
   Discussion: By conceptualizing nurse and staffing variables (education,
   experience, skill mix, full-time employees, RN:patient ratio, RN hours
   per patient day) as attributes of nurse dose and by including these in
   the same analysis, it is possible to determine their relative influence
   on MRSA infections and reported patient falls.}},

Abstract = {{A representative fabrication processing of SU-8 photoresist, Ultraviolet
   (UV) lithography is usually composed of spin coat, soft bake, UV
   exposure, post exposure bake (PEB), development and optional hard bake,
   etc. The exposed region of SU-8 is crosslinked during the PEB process
   and its physical properties highly depend on UV exposure and PEB
   condition. This work was initiated to investigate if thermal baking
   after fabrication can affect the mechanical properties of SU-8
   photoresist material because SU-8 is trying to be used as a structural
   material for MEMS operated at high temperature. Since a temperature of
   95 degrees C is normally recommended for PEB process, elevated
   temperatures up to 200 degrees C were considered for the optional hard
   bake process. The viscoelastic material properties were measured by
   dynamic mechanical analyses (DMA). Also, pulling tests were performed to
   obtain Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio as a function of strain rate
   in a wide temperature range. From this study, the effects of temperature
   on the elastic and viscoelastic material properties of SU-8 were
   obtained.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, NaXH3 (X = Mn, Fe, Co) perovskite type hydrides
   have been investigated by performing first-principles calculation. The
   results of the structural optimizations show that all these compounds
   have negative formation energy implying the thermodynamic stability and
   synthesisability. The mechanical stability of these compounds has been
   studied with the elastic constants. Moreover, the polycrystalline
   properties like bulk modulus, Poisson's ratio, etc. have been obtained
   using calculated elastic constants of interest compounds. The electronic
   properties have been studied and band structures have been drawn with
   the corresponding partial density of states. These plots indicated that
   NaXH3 hydrides show metallic characteristics. The charge transfer
   characteristics in these compounds have been studied with the Bader
   partial charge analysis. The phonon dispersion curves and corresponding
   density of states indicated that NaXH3 compounds are dynamically stable
   compounds. The investigation on hydrogen storage characteristics of
   NaXH3 compounds resulted in hydrogen storage capacities of 3.74, 3.70
   and 3.57 wt\% for X = Mn, Fe and Co, respectively. The present study is
   the first investigation of NaXH3 perovskite type hydrides as known up to

Abstract = {{Cross-shape piezoelectric patches were originally proposed to improve
   the band-gap properties of acoustic metamaterials with shunting
   circuits. The dispersion curves are characterized through the
   application of finite element method. Also, the theoretical band-gap
   predictions are verified by simulation results obtained from COMSOL. The
   investigation results show that the proposed scheme distinguishes itself
   from the conventional square patches by broader band gaps, whose
   bandwidth is almost doubled. The inherent capacitance of the
   piezoelectric patch is strongly related to the boundary conditions, so
   the local resonant band gap is strongly affected by the shape of
   piezoelectric patches as well. As a result, the band-gap width and
   location of metamaterials with different shape patches are rather
   different, even with the same size patches. Also, negative modulus (NM)
   and Poisson's ratio were observed around the resonant frequencies. The
   transmission properties of finite periods agree well with band-gap
   predictions. An obvious attenuation zone (AZ) is produced around the
   band-gap location, in which the wave propagation is decayed strongly.
   Similarly, the width of AZ of the proposed metamaterial is much larger
   than that of the conventional one. Hence, the proposed scheme
   demonstrates more advantages in the application to vibration isolation
   when compared with the conventional.}},

Abstract = {{The PSI-graphene, a two-dimensional structure, was a novel carbon
   allotrope. In this paper, based on molecular dynamics simulation, the
   effects of stretching direction, temperature and vacancy defects on the
   mechanical properties of PSI-graphene were studied. We found that when
   PSI-graphene was stretched along 0 degrees and 90 degrees at 300 K, the
   ultimate strength reached a maximum of about 65 GPa. And when stretched
   along 54.2 degrees and 155.2 degrees at 300 K, the Young's modulus had
   peaks, which were 1105 GPa and 2082 GPa, respectively. In addition, when
   the temperature was raised from 300 K to 900 K, the ultimate strength in
   all directions was reduced. The fracture morphology of PSI-graphene
   stretched at different angles was also shown in the text. In addition,
   the number of points removed from PSI-graphene sheet also seriously
   affected the tensile properties of the material. It was found that,
   compared with graphene, PSI-graphene didn't have the negative Poisson's
   ratio phenomenon when it was stretched along the direction of 0 degrees,
   11.2 degrees, 24.8 degrees and 34.7 degrees. Our results provided a

Abstract = {{The structural, mechanical and electronic properties of the MoSSe/WSSe
   van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure under various degrees of horizontal
   and vertical strain are systematically investigated based on
   first-principles methods. It is found that the MoSSe/WSSe vdW
   heterostructure of the most stable AB stacking is a direct band gap
   semiconductor and exhibits a type-II band alignment, which demonstrates
   an effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and
   increases their lifetime accordingly. The high angle-dependent Young's
   modulus and normal Poisson's ratios show the mechanical stability and
   anisotropy. It is found that the band gap of the heterostructure can be
   modulated effectively by applying strain, exhibiting a decreasing trend
   with increasing strain, and even lead to an intriguing
   semiconductor-metal transition under a certain large tensile strain. In
   particular, a negative correlation between the band gap and structure
   pressure provides a theoretical basis for experimentally regulating the
   electronic properties. Moreover, different strains can induce two
   different conditions of direct-indirect transition or can maintain the
   characteristics of the direct-band-gap. All these interesting results
   provide a detailed understanding of the MoSSe/WSSe vdW heterostructure
   under strain and indicate that it is a good candidate for
   low-dimensional electronic, nano-electronic and optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{A field study was carried out during 2003-04 at Ladakh at to study the
   spatial distribution of onion thrips (Thrips tabaci Lindeman) in `Brown
   Spanish' onion (Allium cepa L.). The various indices of dispersion, viz
   variance mean ratio, exponent k and common k (Kc), Lloyd's indices of
   mean crowding (x{*}) and patchiness index (x{*}root x) and Taylor's
   power law revealed that the onion thrips exhibited aggregated or
   contagious pattern of distribution in the field. The value of Taylor's
   aggregation index (b) was 1.3778 and 1.4186 during 2003 and 2004
   respectively. In study of Iwao's m{*} - m relationship it was found that
   contagiousness coefficient value (a = 1.002 and 1.038 respectively) was
   > 1. This also indicated that thrips population followed negative
   binomial distribution pattern as an alternative of poisson or random
   distribution. The intercept also justified that the distribution of
   thrips was contagion in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Natural acquisition of small amounts of foreign cells or DNA, referred
   to as microchimerism, occurs primarily through maternal-fetal exchange
   during pregnancy. Microchimerism can persist long-term and has been
   associated with both beneficial and adverse human health outcomes.
   Quantitative microchimerism data present challenges for statistical
   analysis, including a skewed distribution, excess zero values, and
   occasional large values. Methods for comparing microchimerism levels
   across groups while controlling for covariates are not well established.
   We compared statistical models for quantitative microchimerism values,
   applied to simulated data sets and 2 observed data sets, to make
   recommendations for analytic practice. Modeling the level of
   quantitative microchimerism as a rate via Poisson or negative binomial
   model with the rate of detection defined as a count of microchimerism
   genome equivalents per total cell equivalents tested utilizes all
   available data and facilitates a comparison of rates between groups. We
   found that both the marginalized zero-inflated Poisson model and the
   negative binomial model can provide unbiased and consistent estimates of
   the overall association of exposure or study group with microchimerism
   detection rates. The negative binomial model remains the more accessible
   of these 2 approaches; thus, we conclude that the negative binomial
   model may be most appropriate for analyzing quantitative microchimerism
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective was to construct textile braiding manufacturing methods to
   facilitate high precision and accurate measurements using optical fiber
   Bragg grating sensors for various structures. We aimed to combine
   three-dimensional (3D) braiding processing with the optical Bragg
   grating sensor's accurate metrology. Outside the limits of the sensor's
   epoxy attachment methods, the textile braiding method can diversify the
   scope of application. The braiding process can be used to design a 3D
   fabric module process for multiple objective mechanical fiber
   arrangements and material characteristics. Optical stress-strain
   response conditions were explored through the optimization of design
   elements between the Bragg grating sensor and the braiding. Here, Bragg
   grating sensors were located 75\% away from the fiber center. The sensor
   core structure was helical with a 1.54 cm pitch, and a polyurethane
   synthetic yarn was braided together with the sensor using a weaving
   machine. From the prototype results, a negative Poisson's ratio resulted
   in a curled braided Bragg grating sensor. The number of polyurethane
   strands was studied to determine the role of wrap angle in the braiding.
   The 12-strands condition showed an increase in double stress-strain
   response rate at a Poisson's ratio of 1.3\%, and the 16-strands
   condition was found to have noise affecting the sensor at a Poisson's
   ratio of 1.5\%. The findings suggested the application of braiding
   fabrication to the Bragg grating sensor could help to develop a new
   monitoring sensor.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this investigation was to adopt an analytical approach to
   analyse stresses at the restoration-dentine interface caused by
   polymerization shrinkage, occlusal and thermal loading with the primary
   focus on evaluating the effect of the material properties of the
   composite restoration on the strength of the interface. Some essential
   simplifications were employed to derive an explicit analytical solution.
   The results confirm previous findings that interfacial stresses due to
   polymerization shrinkage are increased with the higher modulus of
   elasticity of the restoration, while Poisson's ratio of the restorative
   material has a very small influence on these stresses. Occlusal loading
   resulted in much lower interfacial stresses when compared to shrinkage
   and thermal loads. The obtained results were in a good agreement with
   other numerical and clinical studies. From the modelling analysis it was
   found that the majority of commercially available composite restorative
   materials are expected to create significant interfacial stresses when
   subjected to cold temperatures. In addition, it was shown that there is
   a considerable potential for interfacial stresses to be minimised by an
   appropriate selection of thermo-mechanical properties of the restorative
   material especially with the new finding on the negative temperature
   variation effect. (c) 2006 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{By means of molecular dynamics technique, the dynamic process of
   nucleation and motion of a partial dislocation is carefully investigated
   in a nanoscopic specimen of single crystalline nickel under {[}001]
   tension. The mechanism and mechanics are discussed in a new light of the
   two successive unstable behaviors of local lattices observed in the
   homogeneously deformed body; the first unstable behavior is the collapse
   of local lattices that breaks the homogeneous Poisson's contraction,
   leading to the deformation concentration. The second is the unstable
   shear of lattices on a slip plane in the deformation concentrated
   region. The nucleation and glide of dislocation can be observed as the
   migration of atoms on the slip plane as a result of these unstable
   behaviors. The criteria of the onset of the unstable behaviors axe
   evaluated based on the elastic stiffness coefficients, B-ijkl. That is,
   the instability criteria proposed by Wang et al. {[}Wang, J. et al.,
   Phys. Rev, Lett. 71-25 (1993) 4182-4185] are adopted to evaluate local
   instability. The results show that the elastic stiffness of the first
   and second unstable behaviors becomes negative at each onset. Thus, the
   local lattice instabilities cause the dislocation nucleation and motion
   and can be quantitatively evaluated by the negativeness of local B-ijkl.}},

Abstract = {{The field equations of a small-scale point-plane negative DC corona
   discharge in air have been solved in a particular case by the authors.
   The technique was to use a finite-element method for solving Poisson's
   equation, and an algorithm for finding the charge density from a
   current-continuity relation. A single mobility coefficient was adopted
   and the methods were used alternately until convergence was obtained.
   Boundary conditions for this technique are the potentials of the
   electrodes and the measured current distribution. Geometric convergence
   occurs before arithmetic convergence, with the accuracy of the latter
   being better than 1\% for the electric field (typically 0.5\% everywhere
   except at the tip of the active electrode). The uncertainty in the
   solution because of the unknown charge distributions in the small glow
   region has been accurately quantified by using two extreme models.
   Geometrical and numerical differences between these models have been
   shown to be very small. The known accuracy of the solution has allowed a
   thorough appraisal of the Deutsch assumption which forms the basis of
   many approximate methods. The assumption is shown to be unfounded, and
   we conclude that it should be avoided if accurate numerical solutions
   are being sought for general electrode geometries.}},

Abstract = {{Decades of intensive anthelmintic treatment has caused equine large
   strongyles to become quite rare, while the cyathostomins have developed
   resistance to several drug classes. The larval culture has been
   associated with low to moderate negative predictive values for detecting
   Strongylus vulgaris infection. It is unknown whether detection of other
   large strongyle species can be statistically associated with presence of
   S. vulgaris. This remains a statistical challenge because of the rare
   occurrence of large strongyle species. This study used a modified
   Poisson regression to analyse a dataset for associations between S.
   vulgaris infection and simultaneous occurrence of Strongylus edentatus
   and Triodontophorus spp. In 663 horses on 42 Danish farms, the
   individual prevalences of S. vulgaris, S. edentatus and Triodontophorus
   spp. were 12\%, 3\% and 12\%, respectively. Both S. edentatus and
   Triodontophorus spp. were significantly associated with S. vulgaris
   infection with relative risks above 1. Further, S. edentatus was
   associated with use of selective therapy on the farms, as well as
   negatively associated with anthelmintic treatment carried out within 6
   months prior to the study. The findings illustrate that occurrence of S.
   vulgaris in larval cultures can be interpreted as indicative of other
   large strongyles being likely to be present.}},

Title = {{The effect of variations in spatial units on unobserved heterogeneity in
   macroscopic crash models}},
Journal = {{ANALYTIC METHODS IN ACCIDENT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{28-51}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Macroscopic safety models establish a relationship between crashes and
   the contributing factors in a defined spatial unit. Negative binomial
   (NB) and Bayesian negative binomial models with conditional
   autoregressive prior (CAR) are techniques widely used to establish this
   relationship. However, these models do not account for unobserved
   heterogeneity and their output is global and fixed irrespective of the
   spatial unit of the analysis. There is a timely need to understand how
   variations in spatial units affect unobserved heterogeneity. This study
   uses two advanced modeling techniques, the random parameter negative
   binomial (RPNB) and the semi-parametric geographically weighted Poisson
   regression (S-GWPR), to investigate whether explanatory variables found
   to be significant and random in one spatial aggregation will remain
   significant and random when another spatial aggregation is used. The key
   finding is that variations in spatial units do have an impact on
   unobserved heterogeneity. We also found that variations in spatial units
   have a greater impact on unobserved heterogeneity in the RPNB models
   compared to the S-GWPR models. We found that the S-GWPR model performs
   better than the RPNB model with the lowest value of mean absolute
   deviation (MAD) and Akaiki information criterion (AIC) but the two
   modeling techniques produce similar results in terms of the sign of the
   coefficients across the selected spatial units of analysis. Overall, the
   study provides a methodological basis for assessing the impact of
   spatial units on unobserved heterogeneity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   arrivals processes that may be under-, equi- or overdispersed. The first
   is based on the Katz family which includes Poisson, binomial and
   negative binomial distributions as special cases. The second uses the
   generalized Poisson which includes the Poisson distribution as a special
   case and can also cater for under- and over- dispersion. The null
   distribution of the tests is provided and consistency is discussed. Size
   and power properties are investigated under different model assumptions

   investigated as a benchmark for comparison.}},

Abstract = {{The literature lacks comparisons of analytical and numerical
   calculations that have been verified experimentally for elastic
   constants of auxetic cells in cores manufactured from wood materials.
   The aim of this study was to determine the effect of auxetic cell
   geometry and the type of material used in their manufacture on elastic
   properties of the honeycomb panel core. This paper describes properties
   of the materials, from which core cells were modeled and presents
   mathematical models of cell properties. The method of numerical
   optimization of cell shape was specified, and the numerical calculations
   concerning modeled cells are given along with the course and results of
   experimental tests. Additionally, the results of analytical, numerical,
   and experimental tests were compared. Cell geometry had a considerable
   effect on elastic properties of honeycomb panel cores, particularly the
   angle of the cell wall. Moreover, geometric imperfections had a
   significant effect on the results of analytical calculations. Based on
   numerical calculations, satisfactory consistency between these results
   and experimental tests was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{The ridge estimator has been consistently demonstrated to be an
   attractive shrinkage method to reduce the effects of multicollinearity.
   The negative binomial regression model is a well-known model in
   application when the response variable is count data. However, it is
   known that multicollinearity negatively affects the variance of maximum
   likelihood estimator of the negative binomial regression coefficients.
   To address this problem, a negative binomial ridge estimator has been
   proposed by numerous researchers. In this paper, a new negative binomial
   ridge estimator (NNBRE) is proposed and derived. The idea behind the
   NNBRE is to get diagonal matrix with small values of diagonal elements
   that leading to decrease the shrinkage parameter and, therefore, the
   resultant estimator can be better with small amount of bias. Our Monte
   Carlo simulation results suggest that the NNBRE estimator can bring
   significant improvement relative to other existing estimators. In
   addition, the real application results demonstrate that the NNBRE
   estimator outperforms both negative binomial ridge regression and
   maximum likelihood estimators in terms of predictive performance.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic behaviour of a beam subjected to a random train of moving SDOF
   oscillators is investigated. The train of oscillators idealizes the
   stream of vehicles moving over a bridge. The arrivals of the vehicles
   are assumed to be governed by a Poisson counting process and the
   vehicles are assumed to travel at the same constant speed. The
   deflection function of the beam is expanded in terms of approximating
   functions, thus the multi-degree-of-freedom model is obtained. Due to
   the interactions between the motion of the beam and vertical motions of
   the oscillators the resulting ordinary differential equations of motion
   have time-varying coefficients. The number of equations equals n+m,
   where n is the number of degrees of freedom for the beam and m is the
   random number of oscillators, which are simultaneously on the beam; in
   other words the total number of equations varies randomly with time. A
   Monte Carlo simulation method is used to find the mean value and the
   variance of the beam deflection. A sample train of oscillators is
   obtained by sampling the interarrival times from the
   negative-exponential distribution. The equations of motion for each
   sample train of oscillators are solved numerically, using Matlab's ODE
   solvers. The computations have been performed for equal masses of the
   oscillators. The results obtained for a moderately short bridge and
   typical mean arrival rates of vehicles reveal that the transient maxima
   of the mean response occur within first few passage times and the
   response variance becomes then essentially steady. Based on the analysis
   of vehicle occurrence probabilities a simplified simulation technique is
   proposed where the train consists of first few oscillators only. The
   numerical results show that the proposed simplified technique allows the
   prediction of the maximum transient response accurately enough.}},

Title = {{Developing a Random Parameters Negative Binomial-Lindley Model to
   analyze highly over-dispersed crash count data}},
Journal = {{ANALYTIC METHODS IN ACCIDENT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{33-44}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The existence of preponderant zero crash sites and/or sites with large
   crash counts can present challenges during the statistical analysis of
   crash count data. Additionally, unobserved heterogeneity in crash data
   due to the absence of important variables could negatively impact the
   estimated model parameters. The traditional negative binomial (NB) model
   with fixed parameters might not adequately handle highly over-dispersed
   data or unobserved heterogeneity. Many research efforts that have
   involved the negative binomial-Lindley (NB-L) model or the random
   parameters negative binomial (RPNB) model, for example, have attempted
   to improve the inference of estimated coefficients by explicitly
   accounting for extra variation in crash data. The NB-L is a mixed
   modeling approach which provides flexibility to account for additional
   dispersion in data. The RP modeling approach accommodates the effect of
   unobserved variables by allowing the model parameters to vary from one
   observation to another. The following study proposes a combination of
   these models - the random parameters NB-L (RPNB-L) generalized linear
   model (GLM) - to account for underlying heterogeneity and address excess
   over-dispersion. The results show that the RPNB-L model not only
   provides a superior goodness-of-fit (GOF) with the sample data, but also
   offers a better understanding about the effects of potential
   contributing factors. The paper uses the Bayesian framework to provide a
   strategy for eliminating the potential for poor mixing in the Markov
   Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains during the estimation of the RPNB-L
   model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hip fracture is one of the most serious and common health problems among
   elderly which may lead to permanent disability or death. Hip fracture
   commonly occurs in the femoral bone, the major bone in the hip joint.
   Microscopic age related changes in the structure of cortical bone is one
   of the factors that is considered to be partially responsible for the
   increase of fracture risk in elderly. It is of great interest to develop
   a predictable model of such fractures for the aging population in
   preparation of a suitable therapy. These micro structural changes
   influence mechanical properties and, therefore, behavior of bone and are
   critical to understand risk and mechanics of fracture of bone.
   Correlation between cortical bone strength and porosity, as a
   microscopic structural factor, has been examined frequently as a
   function of age and/or porosity. These studies have investigated the
   effect of porosity experimentally and have not studied the effect of
   porosity independently from other structural factors such as bone
   mineral density. In this study effect of porosity on elastic properties
   of human femoral cortical bone was studied independently using finite
   element analysis assuming transversely isotropic behavior in terms of
   elastic properties with the axis of elastic properties along the
   longitudinal axis of femur shaft. In this study, published standard
   mechanical tests for transversely isotropic materials were simulated
   using finite element computer simulation on models with different
   porosities. The developed finite element model utilized material
   properties based on the best fit regression in previously published
   articles. Pores' size, shape and distribution were also modeled based on
   previous experimental studies. The finite element model, in general,
   predicted behavior of five independent elastic mechanical properties,
   namely, longitudinal Young's modulus, transverse poisson's ratio,
   transverse shear modulus, transverse Young's modulus and longitudinal
   poisson's ratio, as a function of porosity. Furthermore, effect of
   porosity on the elastic properties across various age groups was
   investigated using published data on age-related changes in bone
   porosity. Mathematical models based on Finite Element Analysis results
   have been developed using linear least square regression. These models
   show negative linear relationship between studied elastic properties of
   human femoral cortical bone and porosity. The Finite Element Analysis
   results compared well with the previously published experimental data.
   Furthermore, the results obtained show the elastic properties as
   functions of age for females and males. The predicted values for elastic
   properties are lower for men compared to women of age 20 to 40 years
   old. However; after the age of 44, elastic properties of femoral
   cortical bone for men are higher than women. The Finite Element Model
   developed in this study will help to create a clinical bone model for
   the prediction of fracture risk or the selection of suitable therapy in
   orthopedic surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Cristobalite and tridymite are the main SiO2 phases in silica bricks, a
   widespread refractory product. The elastic properties of cristobalite at
   room temperature have been extensively studied, because it is known for
   auxetic behavior, i.e. negative Poisson ratios, whereas the elastic
   properties of tridymite are essentially unknown. Here we show that
   silica brick materials, consisting almost entirely of tridymite and
   cristobalite, exhibit remarkable anomalies in the temperature dependence
   of the Young modulus: in the intermediate temperature range between
   approximately 50 and 250 degrees C these materials become very
   compliant, with stiffness minima of around 60\% of the room temperature
   values, with a broad transition region at the low-temperature end, a
   sharp transition at the high-temperature end and a precisely
   reproducible hysteresis during heating and cooling. Furthermore, it is
   shown that Young's moduli at around 800 degrees C can be more than three
   times as high as the room temperature values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {{Two flood analysis estimation schemes, based on, respectively, partial
   duration series (PDS) and annual maximum series (AMS), are compared. The
   PDS model assumes a Generalized Pareto (GP) distribution for modeling
   the flood exceedances above threshold corresponding to a generalized
   extreme value (GEV) distribution for annual maxima. As a generalization
   of the common assumption of the Poisson distribution (PD) to count the
   occurrences of peaks over threshold in the PDS models, the advantage of
   negative binomial (NB) distribution is explored in this study. The
   T-year event estimator for the annual maximum distribution corresponding
   to the parent PDS model is formulated for producing AMS samples
   consistent with PDS samples which are used in simulations. The
   performance of the two models in terms of the uncertainty of the T-year
   event estimator is evaluated in the cases of estimation with the method
   of probability weighted moments (PWM). In a similar way, the performance
   of the derived PDS/NB-GP model is compared with the existing PDS/PD-GP
   model in terms of uncertainty of T-year event estimator using simulation
   and field data. The results show the T-year event estimate using
   PDS/NB-GP model yields lower variance compared to PDS/PD-GP models for
   most cases. However both the models perform similarly at higher return
   periods more than 300 years, using the ratios of the variance of T-years
   estimate as an index, and the ratio decreases with an increase in mean
   number of annual exceedances above threshold (mu). From the results it
   is observed that both AMS and PDS models yield the same variance when mu
   varies from 1.4 to 1.65. However, in case of NB distribution the PDS and
   AMS models gives the same variance of q(T) when variance (sigma(2)) is
   1.5 times the mean number of annual exceedance above threshold. The
   performance of the PDS models and the corresponding AMS models using the
   available data of Dee (at Cairnton) shows the PDS/NB-GP model to be
   marginally better at return periods lower than 50 years. (C) 2013

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Uniaxial compressive tests were carried out to investigate the
   dilatation behaviour of phyllite samples under different loading
   azimuths. There were four types of samples taken from the
   Chengdu-Lanzhou railway. The results showed that the samples generally
   expanded before the peak stress reached, and the dilatation behaviour
   was influenced by the loading azimuth and degree of anisotropy. The
   vertical strain rate was greater than the horizontal one before the
   dilatation occurred, and vice versa after expansion. When the volumetric
   strain of phyllite samples converted from a positive value to a negative
   one, three conditions existed: pre-peak stress, post-peak stress and
   not-converted. Besides, the probability of the conversion was related to
   the participation degree, the form, and the failure mode of the original
   cracks during the loading process. The maximum dilatation rate appeared
   at the moment when the axial strain reached its maximum value, and the
   high azimuth angle was more sensitive to the dilatation capacity. The
   initiation stress of the dilatation was usually low, and the difference
   between the loading azimuth and lithology was large. The deformation and
   failure process of phyllite under loading was significantly reflected by
   the elastic modulus and Poisson ratio which were greatly affected by the
   dilatancy.}},

   Using the Marginalized Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Model}},
Journal = {{CARIES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{53}},

Pages = {{541-546}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to identify risk factors for decayed,
   missing, and filled permanent teeth (DMFT) in a population of
   12-15-year-old schoolchildren and to apply the marginalized
   zero-inflated negative binomial (MZINB) model for determination and
   estimation of the overall effects of the risk factors. A cross-sectional
   survey comprising 764 students aged between 12 and 15 years was used to
   analyze the association between caries in children and some background
   characteristics in children and their parents. Information on the
   samples' social, behavioral, and demographic status was obtained through
   a series of closed questions. The incidence rate ratios (IRR) were used
   to associate some risk factors with caries. In the entire sample, the
   frequency of zero was 194 (25.4\%). The result of the shared-parameter
   marginalized zero-inflated negative binomial (SP-MZINB) model showed
   that being a girl (IRR = 1.18; p value = 0.021), higher dental visits
   frequency (IRR = 1.20; p value <0.001), lower tooth brushing frequency
   (IRR = 0.91; p value = 0.019), higher flossing frequency (IRR = 1.11; p
   value = 0.001), and lower mothers' education (IRR = 0.89; p value =
   0.042) are associated with DMFT. Our results may provide better insights
   of the factors associated with DMFT, and health programs should focus
   their efforts on healthcare services, for both preventive and curative
   purposes. This regression model provides an appropriate fit and
   meaningful interpretation to handling zero-inflated count outcomes.
   Also, it provides direct estimates of the effects of risk factors on the
   overall mean that does not require postmodeling computations.}},

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to introduce dual-material auxetic
   meta-sandwiches by four-dimensional (4D) printing technology for
   reversible energy absorption applications. The meta-sandwiches are
   developed based on an understanding of hyper-elastic feature of soft
   polymers and elasto-plastic behaviors of shape memory polymers and cold
   programming derived from theory and experiments. Dual-material
   lattice-based meta-structures with different combinations of soft and
   hard components are fabricated by 4D printing fused deposition modelling
   technology. The feasibility and performance of reversible dual-material
   meta-structures are assessed experimentally and numerically.
   Computational models for the meta-structures are developed and verified
   by the experiments. Research trials show that the dual-material auxetic
   designs are capable of generating a range of non-linear stiffness as per
   the requirement of energy absorbing applications. It is found that the
   meta-structures with hyper-elastic and/or elasto-plastic features
   dissipate energy and exhibit mechanical hysteresis characterized by
   non-coincident compressive loading-unloading curves. Mechanical
   hysteresis can be achieved by leveraging elasto-plasticity and
   snap-through-like mechanical instability through compression.
   Experiments also reveal that the mechanically induced plastic
   deformation and dissipation processes are fully reversible by simply
   heating. The material-structural model, concepts and results provided in
   this paper are expected to be instrumental towards 4D printing tunable
   meta-sandwiches for reversible energy absorption applications.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{461-476}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{The homogenization of periodic hexachiral and tetrachiral honeycombs is
   dealt with two different techniques. The first is based on a micropolar
   homogenization. The second approach, developed to analyse
   two-dimensional periodic cells consisting of deformable portions such as
   the ring, the ligaments and possibly a filling material, is based on a
   second gradient homogenization developed by the authors. The obtained
   elastic moduli depend on the parameter of chirality, namely the angle of
   inclination of the ligaments with respect to the grid of lines
   connecting the centers of the rings. For hexachiral cells the auxetic
   property of the lattice together with the elastic coupling modulus
   between the normal and the asymmetric strains is obtained; a property
   that has been confirmed here for the tetrachiral lattice. Unlike the
   hexagonal lattice, the classical constitutive equations of the
   tetragonal lattice turns out to be characterized by the coupling between
   the normal and shear strains through an elastic modulus that is an odd
   function of the parameter of chirality. Moreover, this lattice is found
   to exhibit a remarkable variability of the Young's modulus and of the
   Poisson's ratio with the direction of the applied uniaxial stress.
   Finally, a simulation of experimental results is carried out. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The study of chiral materials is important for the investigation of
   carbon nanotubes, auxetic materials and bones. The chiral effects cannot
   be described within classical elasticity. In this paper, the problem of
   the circular tube under internal and external pressure is solved in the
   context of the linear theory of chiral Cosserat elasticity. The work is
   motivated by the recent interest in the using Cosserat elastic solid as
   model for auxetic materials, bones and chiral carbon nanotubes. First,
   the generalized plane strain of an isotropic chiral elastic material is
   investigated. Then, the solution of the pressure vessel problem is
   established. The salient feature of the solution is that, in the absence
   of body and surface moments, a pressure acting on the surface of a
   chiral tube produces a microrotation of the material particles. It is
   shown that the radial displacement and the radial stress are modified
   from the values predicted by the theory of achiral materials. (C) 2011

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Hierarchically structuring materials open the door to a wide range of
   unexpected and uniquely designed properties. This work presents a novel
   mechanical metamaterial unit cell with strain-dependent solid-solid
   phase changes resultant from hierarchically structured ``mechanisms{''}
   built into an auxetic unit cell, and further presents a realization of
   this kind. The interaction of auxetic structure and mechanism allows
   stable or metastable elastic energy states to be reached as a result of
   mechanical deformation. The result is a principally elastic analog to a
   shape memory material with a functional dependency on its negative
   Poisson's ratio. Prototypes are additively manufactured using direct
   laser writing, and are subsequently subjected to uniaxial compression
   with a customized micromechanical test set up. Experimental results
   depict reversible states initially triggered by deformation; the unit
   cell is a building block for a programmable material with a nonlinear
   ``if horizontal ellipsis then horizontal ellipsis `` relationship.
   Implementing interior mechanisms as a hierarchical level unlocks new
   directions for mechanical metamaterials research, and the authors see
   potential impacts or applications in multi-scale modeling, medicine,
   micro-actuation and -gripping, programmable matter/materials.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the infection heterogeneity of different types of edges
   (lines and edges in the triangle in a network), we formulate and analyze
   an novel SIS model with cluster based mean-field approach for a network.
   We mainly focus on how network clustering influences network structure
   and the disease spreading over the network. In networks with double
   poisson distributions, power law-poisson distribution, poisson-power law
   distributions and double power law distributions, we find that cluster
   is positive(the clustering coefficient is increasing on the expected
   number of triangles) when the average degree of lines is fixed and the
   moment of triangles is less than some threshold. Once the moment of
   triangles exceeds that threshold, cluster will become negative(the
   clustering coefficient is decreasing on the expected number of
   triangles). For the disease, clustering always increases the basic
   reproduction number of the disease in networks with whether positive
   cluster or negative cluster. It is different from existing results that
   cluster always promotes the disease spread in the homogeneous or
   heterogeneous network.}},

Abstract = {{According to feature integration theory, conjunction search is conducted
   via a serial self-terminating search. However, effects attributed to
   search processes operating on the entire display may actually reflect
   search restricted to elements defined by a single feature. In experiment
   1 this question is addressed in a reaction-time (RT) paradigm by varying
   distractor ratios within an array of fixed size. For trials in which the
   target was present in the array, RT functions were roughly symmetric,
   the shortest RTs being for extreme distractor ratios, and the longest
   RTs being for arrays in which there were an equal number of each
   distractor type. This result is superficially consistent with Zohary and
   Hochstein's interpretation that subjects search for only one distractor
   type and are able to switch search strategy from trial to trial.
   However, negative-trial data from experiment 1 cast doubt on this
   interpretation. In experiment 2 the possible role of `pop out' and of
   distractor grouping in visual conjunction search is investigated.
   Results of experiment 2 suggest that grouping may play a more important
   role than does distractor ratio, and point to the importance of the
   spatial layout of the target and of the distractor elements in visual
   conjunction search. Results of experiment 2 also provide clear evidence
   that groups of spatially adjacent homogeneous elements may be processed
   as a unit.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new type of a truly three-dimensional cubic negative
   stiffness lattice structure that can achieve energy absorption and
   recover its original configuration under cyclic loading in excess of a
   strain of approximately 20\%. This structure was composed of multiple
   unit cells exploiting negative stiffness from controlled elastic
   buckling. Structural properties were designed to be tuned by adjusting
   geometry. The effective Poisson's ratio was equal to zero regardless of
   the constituent material. Geometric parameters that can lead to the
   desired energy absorption without yielding the structure were determined
   by finite element analysis. We then fabricated samples representing the
   lattice structure with different sizes through additive manufacturing
   and performed cyclic loading experiments to capture stress-strain
   hysteresis loops. Results clearly showed that the designed structure was
   capable of absorbing mechanical energy effectively with a full recovery
   of geometry in three principal directions and that the amount of energy
   absorbed during cyclic loading increases with its size. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{By using the hydrodynamic equations of positive and two negative ions,
   Boltzmann electron density distribution, and Poisson equation with
   immobile positive/negative dust particles, a cylindrical Korteweg-de
   Vries (CKdV) equation is derived for small but finite amplitude
   ion-acoustic waves. At the critical total negative ion concentration
   and/or the critical density rate of the second-negative ions, the pulses
   collapse at this limit as nonlinearity fails to balance dispersion. Then
   the CKdV equation is not appropriate to describe the system. Therefore,
   the modified CKdV (MCKdV) and extended CKdV (ECKdV) equations are
   derived at the critical plasma compositions and in the vicinity of the
   critical plasma compositions, respectively. The physical parameters of
   two plasma environments (e.g., Xe+-F--SF6- and Ar+-F--SF6- plasmas) are
   examined on the wave phase velocity and the nonlinear localized pulse
   profile. The latter should satisfy necessary condition to exist. The
   localized pulse of Ar+-F--SF6- plasma is much spiky than Xe+-F--SF6-
   plasma. Thus, the mass ratio of the negative-to-positive ions is focused
   upon and it emphasizes to play an important role on the pulse profile.
   Dependence of the geometrical divergence on the pulse profile is also
   investigated, which indicates that the localized pulse damps with time.
   The implications of our results agrees with the experimental
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate whether long-term glucose control,
   as assessed by fasting plasma glucose determinations during 3 years, is
   a predictor of all-cause mortality in elderly NIDDM patients. Five
   hundred and sixty-six NIDDM patients attending the Verona Diabetes
   Clinic, aged 75 years and over, were followed-up from 1 January 1987 to
   31 December 1991 to assess all-cause mortality. From their clinical
   records all fasting plasma glucose determinations available for the
   years 1984 to 1986 were collected and analysed. Patients were grouped in
   tertiles according to mean (M-FPG), coefficient of variation (CV-FPG)
   and trend over time (slope, S-FPG) of fasting plasma glucose during the
   period of retrospective evaluation, Mortality was assessed by
   observed/expected ratios, univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and
   multivariate Poisson regression model. By 31 December 1991, 61 men and
   127 women had died. Increased observed/expected ratios were found in
   women from the top M-FPG tertile, in patients (men and women) from the
   top CV-FPG tertile and in patients with a S-FPG less than -0.30 mmol/l
   per year (lowest tertile). Patients in the lowest tertile of CV-FPG and
   in the middle tertile of S-FPG had a reduced mortality risk.
   Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that patients with high CV-FPG
   as well as those in tertiles I and III of S-FPG (i.e., those with a

Abstract = {{Tolerance intervals for discrete variables are widely used, especially
   in industrial applications. However, there is no thorough treatment of
   tolerance intervals when sampling without replacement. This paper
   proposes methods for constructing one-sided tolerance limits and
   two-sided tolerance intervals for hypergeometric and negative
   hypergeometric variables. Equal-tailed tolerance intervals (i.e.,
   tolerance intervals that control the percentages in both tails) are
   studied followed by a small adjustment to the nominal coverage level to
   obtain tolerance intervals that control a specified inner percentage of
   the sampled distribution. The tolerance interval calculations implicitly
   use confidence bounds for M, the unknown number of elements possessing a
   certain attribute in the finite population of size N. Three different
   methods for obtaining such confidence bounds are suggested: a large
   sample approach, an approach with a continuity correction, and an exact
   method based on nonrandomization. The intervals are examined for
   desirable coverage probabilities and expected widths. The methods are
   also illustrated using some examples.}},

Abstract = {{Many methods have previously been devised to estimate the relative
   amounts of chemicals present in a measured Raman spectrum. However,
   relatively little work has been done on developing physics-based
   probabilistic models for the measurement system. Drawing from previous
   work in astronomical image restoration, we model the acquired data based
   on the physics of two key components in our Raman instrumentation: the
   spectrometer and the charge-coupled device detector. Under this model,
   we derive Cramer-Rao lower bounds for the mixing coefficients of the
   target spectra. This bound is compared against the performance of
   several classification algorithms. The non-negative iteratively
   reweighted least-squares algorithm is seen to give performance that is
   nearly identical to the more computationally demanding
   expectation-maximization approach; this is true even at weak signal
   levels. (C) 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

Abstract = {{As a new class of two-dimensional (2D) materials, 2D covalent organic
   frameworks (COFs) are proven to possess remarkable electronic and
   magnetic properties. However, their mechanical behaviours remain almost
   unexplored. In this work, taking the recently synthesised
   dimethylmethylene-bridged triphenylamine (DTPA) sheet as an example, we
   investigate the mechanical behaviours of 2D COFs based on molecular
   dynamics simulations together with density functional theory
   calculations. A novel phase transformation is observed in DTPA sheets
   when a relatively large in-plane compressive strain is applied to them.
   Specifically, the crystal structures of the transformed phases are
   topographically different when the compressive loading is applied in
   different directions. The compression-induced phase transformation in
   DTPA sheets is attributed to the buckling of their kagome lattice
   structures and is found to have significant impacts on their material
   properties. After the phase transformation, Young's modulus, band gap
   and thermal conductivity of DTPA sheets are greatly reduced and become
   strongly anisotropic. Moreover, a large in-plane negative Poisson's
   ratio is found in the transformed phases of DTPA sheets. It is expected
   that the results of the compression-induced phase transformation and its
   influence on the material properties observed in the present DTPA sheets
   can be further extended to other 2D COFs, since most 2D COFs are found
   to possess a similar kagome lattice structure.}},

Abstract = {{The structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of perovskite
   molybdates are a topic of frequent study in materials science. In this
   study, the influence of Mg doping on the physical metallurgy of
   perovskite molybdates is investigated using first-principles
   calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulation. Our calculated optimized lattice parameters
   (3.9945, 3.8964, 3.8634, 3.8440, and 3.7952 angstrom {[}mentioned only
   DFT data, MD data listed in Table 2] for x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4
   respectively) of SrMo1-xMgxO3 are highly consistent with other
   experimental results (3.9762, 3.9695, and 3.9649 angstrom for x = 0,
   0.1, and 0.2 respectively) and some available theoretical results
   (3.9720 angstrom for x = 0, no previous data available for Mg-doped
   systems). The calculated elastic constants satisfied the Born stability
   criteria, indicating that our studied materials are mechanically stable
   at all doping concentrations, which was also confirmed by the calculated
   negative values of Cohesive energy. The mechanical behaviors of
   perovskite, including elastic constants, elastic moduli, ductility, and
   elastic anisotropy, were investigated and discussed. Our computed
   results suggest that Mg doping can increase elastic moduli. The
   calculated Pugh's ratio increased from 0.42 to 0.71 {[}DFT] and from
   0.47 to 0.75 {[}MD] as well as the Poisson's ratio decreased from 0.31
   to 0.21 {[}DFT] and from 0.30 to 0.21 {[}MD] which transformed the
   compound from ductile to brittle due to the addition of Mg at Mo-site.
   The band structures, density of states, and charge density
   redistributions of the undoped and Mg-doped materials were predicted.
   Our simulation outputs clearly illustrated the importance of accounting
   for Mg doping's influence in theoretical simulations of the physical
   properties of the presently studied perovskite material.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Chiral and reentrant metastructures with auxetic deformation abilities
   can serve as the building blocks in many industrial applications because
   of their light weight, high specific strength, energy absorption
   properties. In this paper, we report an innovative tubular-like
   structure by a combined mechanical effect of antichiral and reentrant.
   2D antichiral-reentrant hybrid structures consisting of circular nodes
   and tangentially-connected ligaments are predesigned and fabricated
   using laser cutting technology with high-resolution. The elastic
   properties and auxeticity of the plane structure are analyzed and
   compared based on finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental
   results. For the first time, the antichiral-reentrant hybrid
   intravascular stents with the auxetic feature are proposed and
   parametric models are devised with good geometrical structure
   demonstrated. A series of large-scale stents are manufactured with
   stereolithography apparatus (SLA) additive manufacturing technique, and
   their mechanical behaviors are investigated in both experimental tests
   and FEA. As the selected antichiral-reentrant hybrid stents with
   tailored expansion ability are subjected to radial loading by the
   dilation of the balloon, stents undergo identifiable deformation
   mechanism due to the beam-like ligaments and circular node elements in
   the varied geometrical design, resulting in the distinct stress outcomes
   in plaque. It is also demonstrated that the antichiral-reentrant hybrid
   stents with tunable auxeticity possess robust mechanical properties
   through implantation inside the obstructed lesion.}},

Abstract = {{The A. N. Stavrogin's experimental data are observed during triaxial
   compression of sandstone samples under proportional loading according to
   T. Karman's scheme. Sandstones have a sufficiently high porosity in the
   initial state, so their deformation within elasticity has the following
   peculiar properties. When the cylindrical sample is uniaxially
   compressed at small initial stresses (of the order of 0.05 divided by
   0.15 of the elastic limit), a nonlinear part is observed on the
   longitudinal strain diagram, which is associated with the material
   densification occurring on this section. This circumstance causes a
   certain difficulty in determining the modulus of elasticity. An
   elaboration of the method for determination the elastic constants
   (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) are proposed taking into account
   the initial deformation diagram's special feature, which was mentioned.
   Earlier A. N. Stavrogin proposed to consider on the longitudinal strain
   diagram a linear part from the indicated initial stress to the
   conditional elastic limit. The elastic modulus is determined by this
   part of the diagram. Linear extrapolation of this segment to zero stress
   level provides a virtually new point of origin for the longitudinal
   strain under consideration. In this paper, it is shown that under
   triaxial compression of a cylindrical specimen, the longitudinal strain
   (satisfying Hooke's law) can be measured from the same new point of
   origin, which is established under uniaxial compression. In this case,
   the lateral strain of the sample is considered in the such range of
   stress variation, at which the increment of the axial stress causes a
   negative increment in the lateral strain. Based on the initial
   experimental values of longitudinal and lateral strain, which were
   adjusted by this method, the conditional elastic limit was determined.}},

Abstract = {{A low-density polymorph of silica, alpha-cristobalite, has been observed
   to have a negative Poisson ratio, i.e., when subjected to a uniaxial
   compression, this crystal contracts in the transverse direction. This
   behavior is uncommon. Other low-density polymorphs of silica, which have
   a similar chemical environment, have been reported to have positive
   Poisson ratios. We have investigated the elastic behavior of several
   silica phases: alpha-quartz, beta-quartz and alpha-cristobalite, with
   first-principles quantum-mechanical calculations, and with interatomic
   potentials. Our calculations confirm a negative Poisson ratio in
   alpha-cristobalite. We predict that a-quartz will have a negative
   Poisson ratio at high tensile strains, and that beta-quartz will never
   assume a negative ratio. We compute the second-order elastic constants
   of alpha-quartz and alpha-cristobalite using interatomic potentials and
   apply them in discussing the anisotropy of Poisson ratios in these
   materials. We demonstrate that the rigidity of the SiO4 tetrahedral
   units is intimately related to the occurrence of negative Poisson ratios
   in crystalline forms of silica.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of atomically thin boron sheets on a silver substrate
   opened a new area in the field of two-dimensional systems. Similar to
   hydrogenated and halogenated graphene, the uniform coating of borophene
   with fluorine atoms can lead to new derivatives of borophene with novel
   properties. In this respect, we explore the possible structures of
   fluorinated borophene for varying levels of coverage (BnF) by using
   first-principles methods. Following the structural optimizations, phonon
   spectrum analysis and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are
   performed to reveal the stability of the obtained structures. Our
   results indicate that while fully fluorinated borophene (BF) cannot be
   obtained, stable configurations with lower coverage levels (B4F and B2F)
   can be attained. Unveiling the stable structures, we explore the
   mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties of (BnF). Fluorination
   significantly alters the mechanical properties of the system, and
   remarkable results, including direction-dependent variation of Young's
   modulus and a switch from a negative to positive Poisson's ratio, are
   obtained. However, the metallic character is preserved for low coverage
   levels, and metal to semiconductor transition is obtained for B2F. The
   heat capacity at a low temperature increases with an increasing F atom
   amount but converges to the same limiting value at high temperatures.
   The enhanced stability and unique properties of fluorinated borophene
   make it a promising material for various high-technology applications in
   reduced dimensions.}},

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{218}},

Abstract = {{The mathematical formalism of the steady-state Poisson equation is
   applied to a variant of Freeman Dyson's ``Toy Model{''} for a first
   origin. Our kinetic approach allows for an examination of the requisite
   conditions under which metabolism is quantized into discrete eigenstates
   (e.g. Dyson's disordered, saddle point, and metabolically active toy
   cell states). The surface reaction machinery additionally allows for
   more realistic modeling, whence the crucial role of sticking
   coefficients (catalyst precursors) as prebiotic selectors emerges. In
   our interior source model, a steady influx of vent nutrients fuels the
   intracellular synthesis of (impermeable) monomers within a
   rock-encradled cavity. Random adsorptions and desorptions occur at
   inactive ``cell{''} wall sites (where the inert monomers remain
   impermeable until their eventual return to the intracellular metabolite
   pool). Occasionally, metabolizing reactions also occur due to
   endogeneous source monomers adsorbing at their ``active{''} sites.
   Dyson's mean field approach is used to simplify the species-specific
   sticking coefficients at empty active (substrate) sites to functions of
   the fraction x of sites occupied by (catalytically) active monomers. In
   short, our work suggests that disorder-order transition models based on
   random drift between discrete metabolic eigenstates (Dyson's Toy Model)
   do not, in general, extend to more realistic metabolisms. From a
   perspective based on quasi-random feedback kinetics, the
   contraindication for discretization (spontaneous generation) in
   non-autocatalytic metabolisms is consistent with the emergence of
   ordered metabolism under hydrothermal driving forces, a provisio the
   occurrence of each period of vent dormancy coincides with a discrete
   zero-source (dormant) metabolic state. Cell drift to higher order is
   induced by the random reactions which happen to enhance the substrate
   specificity (chemical selectivity) of the sticking coefficients for
   active monomers. The result is stronger sink effects for metabolizing
   species, whence active adsorptions are promoted in favor of inactive
   adsorptions at substrate sites. Positive feedback plays a crucial role
   in preserving ({''}propagating{''}) order in the cell wall reaction
   kinetics and is held in check by negative feedback inhibition of
   excessive cell growth. Finally, the eventual desorption of randomly
   growing dysfunctional proteins is postulated as a deterrent to
   deterioration catastrophes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to develop a proposal for Neohydatothrips

   distribution, the ratio test V-2/mu and the negative binomial
   distribution. Temperature is the only climatic variable that
   significantly correlated with the mean density of the thrips. There were
   higher incidence and population density of the insects at the vegetative
   terminal buds, in comparison to the flower buds. The spatial
   distribution pattern for this insect, along all phenological stages of
   the plant, was aggregated. Using the aggregation index and the average
   population, a sample of 22 new vegetative terminal buds per hectare was

Title = {{The roles of auxeticity and volume fraction on gamma ` precipitate
   microstructures in nickel-base alloys}},
Journal = {{PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},

Pages = {{35-42}},
Abstract = {{New correlations are found between the elastic constants and late-stage
   precipitate microstructures in Ni-Al, Ni-Ga, Ni-Ge and Ni-Si alloys. The
   auxetic behaviour of Poisson's ratio, v, measured parallel to {[}001] or
   {[}1 (1) over bar0] in response to {[}110] loading, favours the
   amalgamation of Ni3Al and Ni3Ga precipitates into non-equilibrium shapes
   along cube directions when delta v = (v(v') - v(v'))/v(v')> 0, the
   superscripts referring to the gamma' (Ni3X) and. (Ni-X) phases,
   respectively. When delta v < 0 amalgamation of Ni3Ge and Ni3Si
   precipitates does not occur and the particles retain cuboidal shapes.
   When delta v > 0 amalgamation of Ni3Al and Ni3Ge occurs readily,
   primarily producing laths of both phases. The gamma' volume fraction, f,
   is also shown to play a role in the late-stage microstructures of Ni-Al
   alloys, with an increasing tendency to form Ni3Al laths, rather than
   plates, as f increases. The shapes of elastically soft. precipitates in
   inverse Ni-Al and Ni-Ge alloys are different; Ni-Al precipitates are
   lath shaped, but Ni-Ge precipitates are plate shaped. The Ni-Ge plate
   shape, in a non-auxetic Ni3Ge matrix (Ni3Ge being the sole non-auxetic
   Ni3X phase of the four studied), is the only example of persistent
   plates in any of the Ni-base alloys investigated to date. The
   combination of an elastically soft precipitate (Ni-Ge) in a non-auxetic
   matrix suggests a connection between auxeticity and shape.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Titanium alloys are great implant materials due to their mechanical
   properties and biocompatibility. However, a large difference in Young's
   modulus between bone (similar to 10-40 GPa) and common implant materials
   (ie. Ti-6Al-4V alloy similar to 110 GPa) leads to stress shielding and
   possible implant failure. The present work predicts the single crystal
   elastic stiffness coefficients (c(ij)'s) for five binary systems with
   the body centered cubic lattice of Ti-X (X = Mo, Nb, Ta, Zr, Sn) using
   first-principles calculations based on Density Functional Theory. In
   addition, the polycrystalline aggregate properties of bulk modulus,
   shear modulus, Young's modulus, and Poisson ratio are calculated. It is
   shown that the lower Young's modulus of these Ti-alloys stems from the
   unstable bcc Ti with a negative value of (c(11)-c(12)). The data
   gathered from these efforts are compared with available experimental and
   other first-principles results in the literature, which set a foundation
   to design biocompatible Ti alloys for desired elastic properties. (C)

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of the deltic, squaric, and croconic acids
   were determined in a previous work by using rigorous theoretical
   solid-state methods based in Density Functional Theory using plane waves
   and pseudopotentials using a high-quality setup. These three materials
   were shown to display small negative Poisson ratios (NPR). Croconic acid
   was also shown to exhibit the phenomenon of negative linear
   compressibility (NLC) for applied pressures larger than similar to 0.4
   GPa directed along the direction of minimum Poisson ratio. The main
   purpose of this communication is to show that the croconic acid also
   exhibits the NLC phenomenon when submitted to isotropic pressures. The a
   lattice parameter of croconic acid increases for applied isotropic
   pressures in the range from 0.41 GPa to 0.46 GPa. The computed
   compressibility along a direction at the pressure of P = 0.44 GPa is

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The possibility of designing metamaterials with ad hoc designed
   elasticity tensors or counter-intuitive mechanical properties, such as a
   negative Poisson ratio (auxetics), a negative effective bulk modulus or
   even a negative effective density, has led to the concept of `mechanical
   metamaterials'. Due to their special structures, their mechanical
   properties can be designed to have values that cannot be found in nature
   which are and adapted for specific applications. A very recent and
   interesting set of mechanical metamaterials are pentamodes, materials in
   which five out of six components of the diagonalized elasticity tensor
   tend to zero, hence somehow imitating the behavior of liquids but being
   solid.
   Most studies on pentamodal metamaterials and their applications have
   been linked to the structure proposed by Milton and Cherkaev in their
   pioneering work. Here we present the development of a computer-aided
   design library of potential pentamodal metamaterials, inspired by
   Bravais lattices, together with a comparative study of their mechanical
   properties and the eventual verification of pentamodal behavior as a
   result of simulations based on finite-element methods. We hope this may
   provide useful information for future designs of devices based on these
   interesting structures.}},

   and IRR 1.32, 95\% CI 0.67-2.61 for HIV-negative current smokers).
   Comorbid diseases were also significantly increased according to smoking

   even lower levels of exposure appear to be detrimental in HIV-infected

Abstract = {{Due to the noticeable structural similarity and being neighborhood in
   periodic table of group-IV and -V elemental monolayers, whether the
   combination of group-IV and -V elements could have stable nanosheet
   structures with optimistic properties has attracted great research
   interest. In this work, we performed first-principles simulations to
   investigate the elastic, vibrational and electronic properties of the
   carbon nitride (CN) nanosheet in the puckered honeycomb structure with
   covalent interlayer bonding. It has been demonstrated that the
   structural stability of CN nanosheet is essentially maintained by the
   strong interlayer sigma bonding between adjacent carbon atoms in the
   opposite atomic layers. A negative Poisson's ratio in the out-of-plane
   direction under biaxial deformation, and the extreme in-plane stiffness
   of CN nanosheet, only slightly inferior to the monolayer graphene, are
   revealed. Moreover, the highly anisotropic mechanical and electronic
   response of CN nanosheet to tensile strain have been explored.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the noticeable structural similarity and being neighborhood in
   periodic table of group-IV and -V elemental monolayers, whether the
   combination of group-IV and -V elements could have stable nanosheet
   structures with optimistic properties has attracted great research
   interest. In this work, we performed first-principles simulations to
   investigate the elastic, vibrational and electronic properties of the
   carbon nitride (CN) nanosheet in the puckered honeycomb structure with
   covalent interlayer bonding. It has been demonstrated that the
   structural stability of CN nanosheet is essentially maintained by the
   strong interlayer sigma bonding between adjacent carbon atoms in the
   opposite atomic layers. A negative Poisson's ratio in the out-of-plane
   direction under biaxial deformation, and the extreme in-plane stiffness
   of CN nanosheet, only slightly inferior to the monolayer graphene, are
   revealed. Moreover, the highly anisotropic mechanical and electronic
   response of CN nanosheet to tensile strain have been explored.}},

Abstract = {{The response of epitaxial CoFe2O4 thin films to biaxial compressive
   stress imposed by MgAl2O4 and SrTiO3 single crystalline substrates is
   studied using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. It is found that
   the Poisson ratio ? signals a non-auxetic behavior and depends on the
   substrate used. The Raman modes show an increase in frequency when
   increasing compressive strain by reducing film thickness; this is due to
   the shrinking of the unit cell volume. Such behavior is in qualitative
   agreement with recent ab initio calculations, although the measured
   values are significantly smaller than predictions. In contrast, the
   measured Poisson ratio is found to be in good agreement with
   expectations based on general arguments of atomic packing density.
   Possible guidelines for searching auxetic response in materials with

Abstract = {{In many biomedical applications, covariates are naturally grouped, with
   variables in the same group being systematically related or
   statistically correlated. Under such settings, variable selection must
   be conducted at both group and individual variable levels. Motivated by
   the widespread availability of zero-inflated count outcomes and grouped
   covariates in many practical applications, we consider group
   regularization for zero-inflated negative binomial regression models.
   Using a least squares approximation of the mixture likelihood and a
   variety of group-wise penalties on the coefficients, we propose a
   unified algorithm (Gooogle: Group Regularization for Zero-inflated Count
   Regression Models) to efficiently compute the entire regularization path
   of the estimators. We investigate the finite sample performance of these
   methods through extensive simulation experiments and the analysis of a
   German health care demand dataset. Finally, we derive theoretical
   properties of these methods under reasonable assumptions, which further
   provides deeper insight into the asymptotic behavior of these
   approaches. The open source software implementation of this method is
   publicly available at: .}},

   compared to those of the logrank test, the negative binomial test, and
   the test proposed by Dunson et al. (Toxicol. Sci. 55 (2000) 293). A

Title = {{High Adherence to Iron/Folic Acid Supplementation during Pregnancy Time
   among Antenatal and Postnatal Care Attendant Mothers in Governmental

   Hierarchical Negative Binomial Poisson Regression}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Iron deficiency during pregnancy is a risk factor for anemia, preterm
   delivery, and low birth weight. Iron/Folic Acid supplementation with
   optimal adherence can effectively prevent anemia in pregnancy. However,
   studies that address this area of adherence are very limited. Therefore,
   the current study was conducted to assess the adherence and to identify
   factors associated with a number of Iron/Folic Acid uptake during
   pregnancy time among mothers attending antenatal and postnatal care
   follow up in Akaki kality sub city.
   Methods
   Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of
   557 pregnant women attending antenatal and postnatal care service.
   Systematic random sampling was used to select study subjects. The
   mothers were interviewed and the collected data was cleaned and entered
   into Epi Info 3.5.1 and analyzed by R version 3.2.0. Hierarchical
   Negative Binomial Poisson Regression Model was fitted to identify the
   factors associated with a number of Iron/Folic Acid uptake. Adjusted
   Incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) was
   computed to assess the strength and significance of the association.
   Result
   More than 90\% of the mothers were supplemented with at least one
   Iron/Folic Acid supplement from pill per week during their pregnancy
   time. Sixty percent of the mothers adhered (took four or more tablets
   per week) (95\% CI, 56\%-64.1\%). Higher IRR of Iron/Folic Acid
   supplementation was observed among women: who received health education;
   which were privately employed; who achieved secondary education; and who
   believed that Iron/Folic Acid supplements increase blood, whereas
   mothers who reported a side effect, who were from families with
   relatively better monthly income, and who took the supplement when sick
   were more likely to adhere.
   Conclusion
   Adherence to Iron/Folic Acid supplement during their pregnancy time
   among mothers attending antenatal and postnatal care was found to be
   high. Activities that would address the above mentioned factors were
   highly recommended to ensure the sustainability of mothers' adherence to
   the supplement.}},

Abstract = {{Blackman's diagram of two dimensionless ratios of elastic constants is
   frequently used to correlate elastic properties of cubic crystals with
   interatomic bondings. Every's diagram of a different set of two
   dimensionless variables was used by us for classification of various
   properties of such crystals. We compare these two ways of
   characterization of elastic properties of cubic materials and consider
   the description of various groups of materials, e.g. simple metals,
   oxides, and alkali halides. With exception of intermediate valent
   compounds, the correlation coefficients for Every's diagrams of various
   groups of materials are greater than for Blackaman's diagrams, revealing
   the existence of a linear relationship between two dimensionless Every's
   variables. Alignment of elements and compounds along lines of constant
   Poisson's ratio nu((100), m), (m arbitrary perpendicular to < 100 >) is
   observed. Division of the stability region in Blackman's diagram into
   region of complete auxetics, auxetics and non-auxetics is introduced.
   Correlations of a scaling and an acoustic anisotropy parameter are
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There are conflicting reports of postoperative efficacy of
   negative pressure wound therapy in patients with obesity after cesarean
   delivery. Methods: Retrospective cohort study for patients with obesity
   and negative pressure wound therapy or abdominal dressing after cesarean
   delivery between April 1, 2014 and January 31, 2018. Postoperative
   surgical site infection was defined from medical record charting or
   positive wound culture and confirmed by the hospital's Infection
   Prevention team. Multivariable logistic regression model for surgical
   site infection was conducted including additional potential confounding
   variables. Mantel-Haenszel tests were conducted to stratify by body mass
   index class and operative time, and we performed quasi-Poisson
   regression to determine which factors were associated with an increased
   operative time. Results: We included 4,391 Black or White patients with
   obesity, 696 (15.9\%) underwent negative pressure wound therapy and
   3,695 (84.1\%) abdominal dressing after cesarean delivery. Incidence of
   surgical site infection after negative pressure wound therapy and
   abdominal dressing were 6.1\% and 3.4\%, respectively (2-sample test of
   proportions P < .001). The multivariable logistic regression
   (covariates: race, diabetes, body mass index category, insurance,
   scheduled/emergency, artificial rupture, previous c-section, operative
   time, age, closure type) found negative pressure wound therapy dressing
   was associated with an increased risk of surgical site infection
   (adjusted odds ratio 1.54; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01-2.34), as did
   a Mantel-Haenszel test which was stratified by body mass index (odds
   ratio 1.62; 95\% confidence interval, 1.08-2.43) and a Mantel-Haenszel
   test stratified by operative time (odds ratio 1.85; 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.28-2.65). Negative pressure wound therapy dressing also led
   to an increase in operative time in the Quasi-Poisson regression, which
   was the primary predictor of infection. Conclusion: Negative pressure
   wound therapy was associated with an increased the risk of postoperative
   surgical site infection after cesarean delivery in our obstetric
   patients with obesity. Future prospective studies are needed to
   determine a dressing type and other intervention to decrease
   postoperative cesarean surgical site infection in women with obesity.

Abstract = {{Objectives: Data collected within the German nosocomial infection
   surveillance system KISS are recommended as reference data for judging
   flosocomial infection rates in German intensive care units (ICUS). It is
   unknown whether the KISS data tend to under- or overestimate the true
   infection incidence rates. In this article, methodological aspects of
   the SIR1 study on the incidence of nosocomial infections are discussed,
   with the aim of estimating unbiased incidence rates of nosocomial
   infections in interdisciplinary German ICUs and examining whether the
   KISS data are representative.
   Methods. We discuss the following methodological issues: 1) Sample size
   estimation. 2) Stratified random sampling of German ICUs. 3)
   Investigation of seasonal effects. 4) Statistical modeling of incidence
   rates using a negative binomial regression model. 5) Comparison of
   weighted incidence rates with the standardized rate ratio (SRR).
   Results. Random sampling proved difficult to realize in practice since
   many ICUs refused to participate, particularly those in small hospitals.
   Analysis was adjusted for hospital size. No seasonal trends were found
   in the KISS data. Due to marked differences between ICUs, the number of
   infections is over-dispersed compared to a Poisson model, so negative
   binomial regression was used. Fifty ICUs were observed for two
   consecutive months each, corresponding to 21,832 patient days, during
   which 262 infections occurred. Infections were more frequent in large
   hospitals. The incidence rates provided by the SIR study are on average
   (SRR) 1.89 (1.63-2.20) times as large as those estimated by the KISS
   system.
   Conclusion: For estimating nosocomial infection incidence rates, `random
   sampling and statistical modeling of over-dispersion were successfully
   performed. The study provides evidence that the KISS surveillance system
   tends to underestimate the true incidence rates of nosocomial infections
   in German ICUs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Two phenomenological forms proposed to take into account the
   generation-recombination phenomenon of ions are investigated. The first
   form models the phenomenon as a chemical reaction, containing two
   coefficients describing the dissociation of neutral particles in ions,
   and the recombination of ions to give neutral particles. The second form
   is based on the assumption that in thermodynamical equilibrium, a
   well-defined density of ions is stable. Any deviation from the
   equilibrium density gives rise to a source term proportional to the
   deviation, whose phenomenological coefficient plays the role of a life
   time. The analysis is performed by evaluating the electrical response of
   an electrolytic cell to an external stimulus for both forms. For
   simplicity we assume that the electrodes are blocking, that there is
   only a group of negative and positive ions, and that the negative ions
   are immobile. For the second form, two cases are considered: (i) the
   generation-recombination phenomenon is due to an intrinsic mechanism,
   and (ii) the production of ions is triggered by an external source of
   energy, as in a solar cell. We show that the predictions of the two
   models are different at the impedance as well as at the admittance
   level. In particular, the first model predicts the existence of two
   plateaux for the real part of the impedance, whereas the second one
   predicts just one. It follows that impedance spectroscopy measurements
   could give information on the model valid for the
   generation-recombination of ions. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Damping performance of the free-layer damping structure mainly depends
   on the damping material layout and its material physical properties.
   This paper proposes a concurrent topology optimization method for the
   design of the multi-scale free-layer damping structures with damping
   composite materials. In order to maximize the structural damping
   performance, the density-based topology optimization method is adopted
   to find the optimal layout on both macro and micro scales. For this
   coupled system, the macrostructure is composed of periodic damping
   composite materials, a stiff damping material which is designed for
   maintaining the structural stiffness and a soft damping material which
   is used for improving structural damping. The homogenized effective
   complex elastic matrix is obtained by considering the two damping
   materials layout in the microstructure. Mathematical model is
   established and sensitivity analysis is deduced. Several numerical
   examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   multi-scale optimization method. In-depth discussions are given for the
   effects of the volume fraction of soft damping material in the micro
   scale on the design results. The results show that there is an optimal
   volume ratio of the stiff and soft damping material to make the
   structure reach optimal vibration performance due to the effective
   competition of soft and stiff characteristics of different damping
   materials. The optimal microstructure has relatively great loss moduli
   and high material loss factor, and it also presents a negative Poisson's
   ratio. The structural vibration performance of the optimal multi-scale
   layer damping structure with damping composite materials is
   significantly improved.}},

Abstract = {{Crumpled thin foils as exemplified by crumpled paper balls are complex
   fractal structures that belong to the class of auxetic materials, i.e.
   materials with negative Poisson coefficient. Here we report evidence
   that the unpacking of a crumpled surface is controlled asymptotically by
   a strain-strain relation similar in form to the Richardson scaling which
   describes the diffusion of particles in a turbulent fluid. This
   relationship was found using several photographs that recorded the
   expansion of the transverse deformation of the crumpled paper balls.
   Through an image analysis program we show that the average transversal
   expansion Delta(sigma) over bar - (or the maximum transverse distance
   Delta sigma') exhibits an asymptotic power law scaling with the pull
   strain Delta x. The analysis of the photographs of transverse dilatation
   also showed some aspects similar to those found in Levy's walking

Abstract = {{This study was concerned with the interaction between the cationic
   antimicrobial peptide, protamine (Ptm) and the cytoplasmic membranes of
   the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The objective of the study was to explain the
   observed paradox of internalization without permanent disruption of the
   cell envelope. We carried out Monte Carlo computer simulation of Ptm in
   an aqueous environment in the presence of similar to 100mM NaCl and
   model membranes consisting of either (65:35) or (75:25) PE:PG molar
   ratios. The (75:25) model, representative of the gram-negative
   cytoplasmic membrane, showed that the Ptm center of mass remained at
   least 7nm from the membrane surface leading to the prediction that Ptm
   would not internalize via disruption of the inner membrane.
   By using immunoelectron microscopy of Ptm-treated cells, we showed that
   Ptm internalization to the cytoplasm took place rapidly in the presence
   or absence of the outer envelope. Ultrastructural examination revealed
   no obvious morphological changes to cells that were treated with
   subinhibitory or bactericidal levels of Ptm. Reconstituted phospholipid
   bilayers were constructed and were unperturbed by Ptm treatment over a
   wide range of concentrations and applied transmembrane voltages. We
   conclude that in the cases of the cell envelopes of E.coli,
   S.typhimurium and P.aeruginosa, Ptm internalized by means independent of
   the phospholipid bilayer, most likely mediated by one or more membrane
   proteins such as cation-selective barrel-like proteins. Work is
   currently underway to test this hypothesis. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Title = {{Comprehensive crustal structure and seismological evidence for lower
   crustal flow in the southeastern margin of Tibet revealed by receiver
   functions}},
Journal = {{GONDWANA RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The lower crustal flow model has become an interesting proposal to
   describe the growth and expansion of eastern Tibet. To date, however,
   the geophysical results are not definitive due to the non-uniqueness of
   the solutions found through data inversion and the resolution
   limitations. In this study the polarity of P-to-S converted phases at
   intra-crustal interfaces are analyzed in order to reveal evidence for
   low seismic velocity and lower-crustal flow in southeastern Tibet. We
   are interested in a joint study that is both a mapping of the crustal
   structure (Moho topography and Poisson's ratio) and an attempt to
   constrain an ICLVZ. We have determined the crustal thickness and
   Poisson's ratio from P (PRFs) and S (SRFs) receiver functions acquired
   in 108 permanent seismic stations deployed in the Sichuan and Yunnan
   areas. Also, we have obtained 98 measurements of Pms-phase splitting
   parameters at the array stations. The crustal thickness provided by PREs
   is consistent with that given by SRFs. It varies from similar to 60 km
   in the Songpan-Ganzi (SG) fold system and the northern part of the
   Sichuan-Yunnan diamond shaped block (SYDSB), near the Eastern Himalayan
   Syntaxis, to similar to 33 km in southern Yunnan. The Poisson's ratio
   varies mostly from 0.24 to 0.32; the highest values 0.28-0.32 are found
   along the axis formed by the Longmenshan fault, the Lijiang-Jinhe fault
   and in the Tengchong volcano area. The value of similar to 0.28 observed
   in SYDSB and the SG fold system is attributed to the presence of a
   low-velocity zone in the lower crust, and partly to the great sediment
   thickness in Sichuan Basin. The crust is clearly anisotropic in the
   southeastern margin of Tibet: the fast-wave polarization direction
   exhibits a NW-SE regional bias, while the time delay varies between 0.07
   s and 1.27 s, being the average 0.54 s +/- 0.12 s, implying the
   existence a strong shear zone in the lower crust. Based on the negative
   polarity observed after the direct P-wave in teleseismic receiver
   functions, we have detected an intra-crustal low-velocity zone (ICLVZ)
   in a wide region including east and southeast of Tibet and southern
   Yunnan, so both the shear zone and ICLVZ suggest the existence of lower
   crustal flow. The reverberation PpPs and PsPs + PpSs phases at the Moho
   are clearly weaker in SYDSB and the SG fold system than in the Indochina
   Block and eastern Yunnan, implying that SYDSB has a structure and
   tectonic history different from Indochina on its west side and eastern
   Yunnan on its east side. The above results provide seismological
   evidence for a lower crustal flow spreading from the eastern Tibet and
   that in its advance southward has invaded SYDSB widely, crossed the
   Lijiang-Jinhe fault and reached southern Yunnan. (C) 2017 International

Journal = {{BIOMETRICS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{106-115}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{As a major analytical method for outbreak detection, Kulldorff's
   space-time scan statistic (2001, Journal of the Royal Statistical
   Society, Series A 164, 61-72) has been implemented in many syndromic
   surveillance systems. Since, however, it is based on circular windows in
   space, it has difficulty correctly detecting actual noncircular
   clusters. Takahashi et al. (2008, International Journal of Health
   Geographics 7, 14) proposed a flexible space-time scan statistic with
   the capability of detecting noncircular areas. It seems to us, however,
   that the detection of the most likely cluster defined in these
   space-time scan statistics is not the same as the detection of localized
   emerging disease outbreaks because the former compares the observed
   number of cases with the conditional expected number of cases. In this
   article, we propose a new space-time scan statistic which compares the
   observed number of cases with the unconditional expected number of
   cases, takes a time-to-time variation of Poisson mean into account, and
   implements an outbreak model to capture localized emerging disease
   outbreaks more timely and correctly. The proposed models are illustrated
   with data from weekly surveillance of the number of absentees in primary
   schools in Kitakyushu-shi, Japan, 2006.}},

   state-of-the-art review}},
Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{161}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Vibration and sound control is critical to many practical engineering
   systems in order to minimise the detrimental effects caused by
   unavoidable vibrations and noises. Metamaterials and origami-based
   structures, which have attracted increasing interests in
   interdisciplinary research fields, possess many peculiar physical
   properties, including negative Poisson's ratios, bi- or multi-stable
   states, nonlinear and tuneable stiffness features, and thus offer
   promising applications for vibration and sound control. This paper
   presents a review of metamaterials and origami-based structures as well
   as their applications to vibration and sound control. Metamaterials are
   artificially engineered materials having extremal properties which are
   not found in conventional materials. Metamaterials with abnormal
   features are firstly discussed on the basis of the unusual values of
   their elastic constants. Recent advances of auxetic, band gap and
   pentamode metamaterials are reviewed together with their applications to
   vibration and sound mitigations. Origami, as the ancient Japanese art of
   paper folding, has emerged as a new design paradigm for different
   applications. Origami-based structures can be adopted for vibration
   isolation by using their multi-stable states and desirable stiffness
   characteristics. Different origami patterns are reviewed to show their
   configurations and base structures. Special features, such as bi- or
   multi-stable states, dynamic Poisson's ratios, and nonlinear
   force-displacement relationships are discussed for their applications
   for vibration control. Finally, possible future research directions are
   elaborated for this emerging and promising interdisciplinary research
   field. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Fracture Hits in Unconventional Reservoirs: A Critical Review}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{412-434}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{``Fracture hit{''} was initially coined to refer to the phenomenon of an
   infill-well fracture interacting with an adjacent well during the
   hydraulic-fracturing process. However, over time, its use has been
   extended to any type of well interference or interaction in
   unconventional reservoirs. In this study, an exhaustive literature
   survey was performed on fracture hits to identify key factors affecting
   the fracture hits and suggest different strategies to manage fracture
   hits. The impact of fracture hits is dictated by a complex interplay of
   petrophysical properties (high-permeability streaks, mineralogy, matrix
   permeability, natural fractures), geomechanical properties (near-field
   and far-field stresses, tensile strength, Young's modulus, Poisson's
   ratio), completion parameters (stage length, cluster spacing, pumping
   rate, fluid and proppant amount), and development decisions (well
   spacing, well scheduling, fracture sequencing). It is difficult to
   predict the impact of fracture hits, and they affect both parent and
   child wells. The impact on the child wells is predominantly negative,
   whereas the effect on parent wells can be either positive or negative.
   The ``child wells{''} in this context refer to the wells drilled with
   pre-existing active/inactive well(s) around. The ``parent well{''}
   refers to any well drilled without any pre-existing well around.
   Overall, fracture hits tend to negatively affect both the production and
   economics of lease development. The optimal approach rests in
   identifying the reservoir properties and accordingly making
   field-development decisions that minimize the negative impact of
   fracture hits. The different strategies proposed to minimize the
   negative impact of fracture hits are simultaneous lease development,
   thus avoiding parent/child wells (i.e., rolling-, tank-, and
   cube-development methods); repressuring or refracturing parent wells;
   using far-field diverters and high-permeability plugging agents in the
   child-well fracturing fluid; and optimizing stage and cluster spacing
   through modeling studies and field tests. Finally, the study concludes
   with a recommended approach to manage fracture hits. There is no silver
   bullet, and the problem of fracture hits in each shale play is unique,
   but by using the available data and published knowledge to understand
   how fractures propagate downhole, measures can be taken to minimize or
   even completely avoid fracture hits.}},

Abstract = {{The dominant physical properties of SF6 are reviewed, and it is shown
   that the very high electron attachment coefficient in SF6 leads to a
   very different form of electrical corona in SF6, compared to that in
   air. The key to understanding these differences is the characteristic
   attachment time, tau, for the formation of negative ions which is 0.06
   ns for typical SF6 conditions, and 143 ns for typical conditions in air.
   As a consequence of the short attachment time, the field in an SF6
   streamer channel is limited to E greater than or equal to E{*}, greatly
   limiting the range of the streamers. (E is the electric field, and E{*}
   is the field for which the ionisation equals attachment.) In air such
   restrictions do not apply, due to the slower attachment rate, and
   streamers have a much greater range. The development of discharges (from
   the first electron through to fully developed discharges) is outlined
   for parallel plate electrodes, and point-plane electrodes in SF6 at
   atmospheric pressure with dc and impulse applied voltages. The theories
   are developed by solving the simultaneous continuity equations for
   electrons, positive ions, and negative ions, coupled with Poisson's
   equation which describes the space-charge dominated electric field. The
   effects of ionisation, attachment, recombination and photoionisation are
   included. The occurrence of stepped leaders in SF6 (similar to those
   occurring during lightning) is discussed, and preliminary results are
   presented which reveal a likely mechanism for streamer channel heating
   which causes leader formation in SF6. Results for the effects of
   pressure and of additives on corona formation in SF6 are also discussed.
   Finally, a practical solution is proposed for the problem of the failure
   of the corona fine tuning of the accelerator voltage in contaminated
   SF6.}},

Abstract = {{Burr is an important character of the surface quality for machined
   parts, and it is even more severe in micro cutting. Due to the uncut
   chip thickness and the cutting edge radius at the same range in micro
   cutting process, the tool extrudes the workpiece with negative rake
   angle. The workpiece flows along the direction of minimum resistance,
   and Poisson burr is formed. Based on the deformation analysis and
   experiment observations of micro cutting process, the factor for Poisson
   burr formation is analyzed. It is demonstrated that the ratio of the
   uncut chip thickness to the cutting edge radius plays an important role
   on the height of Poisson burr. Increasing the uncut chip thickness or
   decreasing the cutting edge radius makes the height of exit burr reduce.
   A new model of micro exit burr is established in this paper. Due to the
   size effect of specific cutting energy, the exit burr height increases.
   The minimum exit burr height will be obtained when the ratio of uncut
   the chip thickness to the cutting edge radius reaches 1. It is found
   that the curled radius of the exit burr plays an important role on the
   burr height.}},

Abstract = {{The role of 5-fold twin boundary on the structural and mechanical
   properties of fcc Fe nanowire under tension is explored by classical
   molecular dynamics. Twin-stabilized fcc nanowire with various diameters
   (6-24 nm) are examined by tension tests at several temperatures ranging
   from 0.01 to 1100 K. Significant increase in the Young's modulus of the
   smaller nanowires is revealed to originate from the central area of
   quinquefoliolate-like stress-distribution over the 5-fold twin, rather
   than from the surface tension that is often considered as the main
   source of such size-effects found in nanostructures. Because of the
   excess compressive stress caused by crossing twin-boundaries, the atoms
   in the center behave stiffer than those in bulk and even expand
   laterally under axial tension, providing locally negative Poisson's
   ratio. The yield strength of nanowire is also enhanced by the twin
   boundary that suppresses dislocation nucleation within a fcc
   twin-domain; therefore, the plasticity of nanowire is initiated by
   strain-induced fcc -> bcc phase transformation that destroys the twin
   structure. After the yield, the nucleated bcc phase immediately spreads
   to the entire area, and forms a multigrain structure to realize ductile
   deformation followed by necking. As temperature elevated close to the
   critical temperature between bcc and fcc phases, the increased stability
   of fcc phase competes with the phase transformation under tension, and
   hence dislocation nucleations in fcc phase are observed exclusively at
   the highest temperature in our study.}},

Title = {{Mechanics of penta-graphene with vacancy defects under large amplitude
   tensile and shear loading}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{27}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{Penta-graphene is a new two-dimensional metastable carbon allotrope
   composed entirely of carbon pentagons with unique electronic and
   mechanical properties. In this work we evaluate the mechanical
   properties of new classes of defective penta-graphene (DPG) subjected to
   tensile and shear loading by using molecular dynamics simulations. The
   types of defects considered here are monovacancy at either 4-coordinated
   C1 site or 3-coordinated C2 site, and double vacancy (DV). We focus in
   particular on the effects of the different topologies of defects and
   their concentrations on the elastic constants and the nonlinear
   mechanics of this allotropic form of carbon. The results indicate that
   DPG has a plastic behavior similar to pristine penta-graphene, which is
   caused by the irreversible pentagon-to-polygon structural transformation
   occurring during tensile and shear loading. The tensile and shear moduli
   decrease linearly with the concentration of defects. Monotonic
   reductions of the tensile yield and shear stresses are also present but
   less pronounced, while the yield strains are unaffected. Penta-graphene
   with 4-coordinated and DVs feature a change of the Poisson's ratio from
   negative to positive when the defect concentration rises to about 3\%
   and 6\%. Temperature can trigger structural reconstruction for
   free-standing DPG. The critical transition temperature increases due to
   the vacancy defects and the defects can delay the structure transition.
   These findings are expected to provide important guidelines for the
   practical applications of penta-graphene based micro/nano
   electromechanical systems.}},

Abstract = {{The machinery degradation process is described by a random process in
   which failures occur with constant intensity, and with each failure the
   rate of benefits generated by the machinery item reduces by a random
   amount. If the machinery item begins to generate negative benefits, it
   is subject to decommissioning. We get explicit expressions for the
   average life of the machinery items and the coefficient of variation of
   the service life. Machine's value is determined by discounting the flow
   of benefits from its future use. This allows to link this value with the
   rate of benefits that the machinery item brings. In cases where there is
   no information on the amount of such benefits, appraisers rely on the
   machine's age. However, different machinery items of the same age may be
   found in a different condition and therefore are characterized by
   different values. We offer formulas for calculating the percent good
   factors reflecting the average decrease in the equipment's value with
   age. To take into account the effects of income tax, property tax and
   inflation, it suffices to adjust the discount rate in the constructed
   model. It has been verified that the proposed dependencies are in a
   fairly good agreement with market price data for two different types of

Abstract = {{The presence of anisotropy in earth materials has been widely accepted.
   Due to its high symmetry and relative simplicity in mathematical
   formulae, transversely isotropic (TI) medium has become one of the most
   important anisotropic media in seismology. In theoretical and practical
   studies, anisotropic parameters expressed in terms of elastic constants
   proposed by Thomsen in 1986 are widely adopted. Values of elastic
   constants and Thomsen's anisotropic parameters cannot be chosen freely.
   There are some constraints among those parameters. Unfortunately, such
   constraints were ignored by some authors. Sometimes improper parameters
   were selected and consequently physically meaningless and misleading
   results were generated. In this study, we proposed a set of simple
   inequalities for constraining the values of Thomsen's anisotropic
   parameters. The inequalities, given by 1/4 < f =1 -
   beta(2)(0)/alpha(2)(0)< 1, epsilon > - f/2, 1/2f-1 <delta < 2 (1/f - 1),
   and -1/2 <gamma < (1+ 2 epsilon)/4 (1 - f) - 1/2, were developed based
   upon the stability condition of material as well as theoretical and
   experimental investigations on anisotropic parameters. It was shown that
   epsilon, delta and gamma can be either positive or negative, and their
   ranges are mainly constrained by P-to-S velocity ratio beta(0)/alpha(o);
   delta, gamma and beta(0)/alpha(0) are bounded, while epsilon has no
   upper limit; gamma and epsilon are positively correlated, and the upper
   limit of gamma is related to epsilon; the links between epsilon and
   delta, and between gamma and delta are weak. It was also proved in this
   paper that the inequalities about five independent elastic constants of
   TI media derived from the stability condition are sufficient to
   guarantee that all the phase velocities of three body waves are
   non-negative. Constraints for some special TI media and physical
   phenomena were reviewed. For elliptical anisotropy, epsilon equals to
   delta and thus 1/2 f - 1 <epsilon < 2 (1/f - 1). For equivalent TI
   medium arising from periodic isotropic thin layers, we have epsilon >=
   max(0, delta) and gamma >= 0. For some directions called longitudinal
   directions, at which phase velocity of P waves reaches an extremum, the
   direction of P polarization is coincident with wavenormal and ray
   direction. The sufficient and necessary condition for the presence of
   longitudinal direction is given by epsilon/delta(L)< 1/2, where delta(L)
   = C-13 + 2C(55) - C-33)/C-33 is the linear definition of Thomsen's delta
   and C-ij, elastic constants. For the presence of SV triplications, the
   inequality delta - epsilon/f > (1- f)/2 is the condition for basal
   triplication, and delta - epsilon >(1 - f)/2 for axial triplication,
   (epsilon-delta)/(1+delta)> 2(1 - f)/3 for oblique triplication. The
   inequality for oblique triplication is simplified from the inequality
   proposed by Thomsen and Dellinger (2003). We also extend the constraints
   on elastic constants and anisotropic parameters of TI media to those of
   orthorhombic media.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical instabilities are traditionally regarded as a route toward
   failure. However, they can also be exploited to design architected
   cellular materials with tunable functionality. In this review, we focus
   on three examples and show that mechanical instabilities in architected
   cellular materials can be harnessed (a) to design auxetic materials, (b)
   to control the propagation of elastic waves, and (c) to realize reusable
   energy-absorbing materials. Together, these examples highlight a new
   strategy to design tunable systems across a wide range of length scales.}},

Abstract = {{On a Lie group S=NA, that is a split extension of a nilpotent Lie group
   N by a one-parameter group of automorphisms A, a probability measure mu
   is considered and treated as a distribution according to which
   transformations s is an element of S acting on N=S/A are sampled. Under
   natural conditions, formulated some over thirty years ago, there is a
   mu-invariant measure < i > m </i > on < i > N </i >. Properties of < i >
   m </i > have been intensively studied by a number of authors. The
   present article deals with the situation when mu(A) = P(s(t) is an
   element of A), where R+ is an element of t -> s(t) is an element of S is
   the diffusion on S generated by a second order subelliptic,
   hypoelliptic, left-invariant operator on S. In this article the most
   general operators of this kind are considered. Precise asymptotic for m
   at infinity and for the Green function of the operator are given. To
   achieve this goal a pseudodifferential calculus for operators with
   coefficients of finite smoothness is formulated and applied.}},

Abstract = {{With a continuous expansion of the number and activity of wild animals

Abstract = {{A theory is presented for the development of streamers from a positive
   point in atmospheric air. The continuity equations for electrons,
   positive ions, and negative ions are solved simultaneously with
   Poisson's equation. For an applied voltage of 20 kV across a 20 mm gap,
   streamers are predicted to cross the gap in 26 ns, and the calculated
   streamer velocities are in fair-agreement with experiment. When the gap
   is increased to 50 mm for the same voltage, the streamer is predicted
   not to reach the cathode. In this case an intense electric field front
   rapidly propagates about 35 mm into the gap in 200 ns. For a further 9.5
   mu s the streamer slowly moves into the gap, until the electric field at
   the head of the streamer collapses, and the streamer front stops moving.
   Finally, only positive space-charge remains; this moves away from the
   point, allowing the field near the point to recover, giving rise to a
   secondary discharge near the anode. The electric field distribution is
   shown to be quite different from that found previously for SF6; this is
   explained by the much lower attachment coefficient in air compared with
   that in SF6. These results show that streamers in air have a far greater
   range than streamers in SF6. This greater range cannot be explained by
   comparison of the values of E{*}, the electric field at which ionisation
   equals attachment.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular mechanics simulations were used to analyse the on-axis
   mechanical properties of a series of nanonetworks. These consisted of
   naphthacene-like units linked together through acetylene chains, and
   designed to mimic the geometry of a winerack-like structure in one of
   the major planes, a geometry which is closely associated with negative
   linear compressibility. It was found that these networks have a
   potential to exhibit a negative linear compressibility in one of the
   major axis. An analysis of the deformation mechanism as well as the
   magnitudes of the compressibility in the major directions suggest that
   this effect arises from relative rotations of the rigid polyphenyl
   chains and is comparable to that predicted by an idealised winerack
   model deforming through hinging. This confirms that there is a very
   strong link between negative linear compressibility and geometry, as is
   the case with auxetic materials. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Abstract = {{Ratio estimation of the parametric mean for a characteristic measured on
   plants sampled by a line intercept method is presented and evaluated via
   simulation using different plant dispersion patterns (Poisson, regular
   cluster, and Poisson cluster), plant width variances, and numbers of
   lines. The results indicate that on average the estimates are close to
   the parametric mean under all three dispersion patterns. Given a fixed
   number of lines, variability of the estimates is similar across
   dispersion patterns with variability under the Poisson pattern slightly
   smaller than variability under the cluster patterns. No variance
   estimates were negative under the Poisson pattern, but some estimates
   were negative under the cluster patterns for smaller numbers of lines.
   Variance estimates become closer to zero similarly for all spatial
   patterns as the number of lines increases. Ratio estimation of the
   parametric mean in line intercept sampling works better, from the
   viewpoint of approximate unbiasedness and variability of estimates,
   under the Poisson pattern with larger numbers of lines than other
   combinations of spatial patterns, plant width variances and numbers of

   performed on chiral lattices and chiral lattices filled composite tubes.
   For the different cases, the load-displacements curves were analyzed and
   the specific energy absorption (SEA) values were compared. The SEA
   capability for the axial quasi-static crushing of the chiral lattices
   filled composite tubes decreased in comparison with the hollow composite
   design. However, the most significant result was that the average SEA

Abstract = {{Recently, two-dimensional (2D) transition metal nitrides have triggered
   an enormous interest for their tunable mechanical, optoelectronic, and
   magnetic properties, significantly enriching the family of 2D materials.
   Here, by using a broad range of first-principles calculations, we report
   a systematic study of 2D rectangular materials of titanium mononitride
   (TiN), exhibiting high energetic and thermal stability due to in-plane
   d-p orbital hybridization and synergetic out-of-plane electronic
   delocalization. The rectangular TiN monolayer also possesses enhanced
   auxeticity and ferroelasticity with an alternating order of Possion's
   Ratios, stemming from the competitive interactions of intra- and
   inter-Ti-N chains. Such TiN nanosystem is a n-type metallic conductor
   with specific tunable pseudogaps. Halogenation of TiN monolayer
   downshifts the Fermi level, achieving the optical energy gap up to 1.85
   eV for TiNCl(Br) sheet. Overall, observed electronic features suggest
   that the two materials are potential photocatalysts for water splitting
   application. These results extend emerging phenomena in a rich family 2D
   transition-metal-based materials and hint for a new platform for the
   next-generation functional nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Even with two doses of an experimental drug in Phase III studies, with
   the commonly used approach for assessing treatment effects of individual
   doses, it may still be difficult to determine the final commercial dose.
   In such a scenario, with plasma concentration data collected in the
   studies, a modeling approach can be applied to predict treatment effects
   at different plasma concentration levels. Through an established
   relationship between plasma concentration and dose, the treatment
   effects of doses not studied in the Phase III studies can then be
   predicted. The results can further be applied to justify the final dose
   confirmation or selection. In this article, a Phase III program example
   with count data as the primary endpoint in the multiple sclerosis area
   is used to illustrate the application of such a technique for dose
   confirmation. Several models, such as the overdispersion Poisson model,
   negative binomial model, and recurrent event models, are considered. The
   negative binomial model is preferable due to better data fitting and the
   capability of within-treatment assessment and between-treatment

Title = {{Rock Physical Model and AVO Patterns for the Mud-Rich Source Rock}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Rock physical model and amplitude variation with offset (AVO) patterns
   considering the content of organic matter and the composition of
   minerals have a wider significance for guiding the identification and
   prediction of the mud-rich source rock. A rock physical model is
   proposed for describing the elastic properties of kerogen in different
   maturity stages. The proposed rock physical model builds an intrinsic
   connection between the elastic properties and physical parameters of the
   mud-rich source rock, thereby providing a theoretical basis for a
   seismic inversion and a seismic forward modeling. To overcome the
   limitations of laboratory measurement, a combination-four-parameter
   regression (CFPR) method is further proposed to estimate the continuous
   total organic carbon (TOC) values for the verification and analysis of
   the rock physical model. The modeling results reveal that the P-wave
   velocity and P-wave impedance will decrease with an increase in TOC, and
   the Poisson ratio and Poisson impedance will increase as the mud content
   increases, which are consistent with the conclusions of the cross plot
   using the actual well data. Based on the proposed rock physical model,
   the seismic responses of the mud-rich source rock are further modeled.
   The synthetic seismic records are consistent with the well-side seismic
   records, the top reflection of the mud-rich source rock behaves as a
   stronger negative event dimming with an incident angle corresponding to
   a class IV AVO pattern, and the bottom reflection exhibits a class I AVO
   anomaly. In addition, a two-layer model is constructed to analyze an
   effect of the TOC content and mud content on the AVO characteristics.
   The results indicate that increasing the TOC content and mud content
   will significantly increase the interceptions and slightly change the
   gradients of the P-P reflection coefficients. These results help to
   guide the identification and evaluation of the mud-rich source rock.}},

Abstract = {{One- and two-dimensional linear and nonlinear creep models for
   predicting the time-dependent behavior of a concrete composite under
   compression are proposed. These models use the analytical and iterative
   solutions of the Volterra integral equation. The analytical approach is
   based on the age-adjusted effective modulus method, and the nonlinear
   technique applies an iterative approach to the system of non-linear
   equations, implying a generalization of the principle of superposition.
   Both models are validated in this study.
   It has been recently found that negative Values of the aging coefficient
   can emerge in early age multi-layered composites when the stress
   redistribution between the layers is governed by the combination of
   considerably different creep strains and aging of the layers.
   In the plane-strain state, the two-dimensional creep analysis of
   multi-layered composites yields the same vertical stress-time history as
   that in a one-dimensional case if the Poisson ratios of the layers are
   equal. This is valid even though the average value of the vertical
   stress used to calculate the Volterra integral term is dependent on the
   Poisson ratio of the layers. In particular, the evolution of vertical
   stress with time is dependent only on the vertical strain and
   compatibility conditions in a direction parallel to the lamination.
   A fracture mechanics approach is also introduced to predict the gradual
   degradation of long-term strength for a multi-layered composite under a
   sustained compressive load. The results show that the stress
   redistribution near the crack-tip under the final period of a high level
   of sustained loading may lead to an additional required compressive
   stress for complete failure of the composite. Long-term failure
   primarily begins with the less deformable (stiffer) layers because the
   more-deformable layers can relieve the initial stresses. Thus, the
   long-term strength of the composite can exceed its instantaneous
   strength for early age composites or for composites composed of layers
   that possess considerably different creep and aging properties. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae), is one of the most important pests of cotton production
   worldwide. The objective of this work was to develop a sequential
   sampling plan for the boll weevil. The studies were conducted in
   Maracaju, MS, Brazil, in two seasons with cotton cultivar FM 993.A
   10,000-m(2) area of cotton was subdivided into 100 of 10- by 10-m plots,
   and five plants per plot were evaluated weekly, recording the number of
   squares with feeding + oviposition punctures of A. grandis in each
   plant. A sequential sampling plan by the maximum likelihood ratio test
   was developed, using a 10\% threshold level of squares attacked. A 5\%
   security level was adopted for the elaboration of the sequential
   sampling plan. The type I and type II error used was 0.05, recommended
   for studies with insects. The adjustment of the frequency distributions
   used were divided into two phases, so that the model that best fit to
   the data was the negative binomial distribution up to 85 DAE (Phase I),
   and from there the best fit was Poisson distribution (Phase II). The
   equations that define the decision-making for Phase I are S-0 = -5.1743
   + 0.5730N and S-1 - 5.1743 + 0.5730N, and for the Phase II are S-0 =
   -4.2479 + 0.5771N and S-1 = 4.2479 + 0.5771N. The sequential sampling
   plan developed indicated the maximum number of sample units expected for
   decision-making is similar to 39 and 31 samples for Phases I and II,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive field surveys were conducted in eastern Nebraska to determine
   the frequency distribution model and associated parameters of broadleaf
   and grass weed seedling populations, The negative binomial distribution
   consistently fit the data over time (1992 to 1993) and space (fields)
   for both the inter and intrarow broadleaf and grass weed seedling
   populations, The other distributions tested (Poisson with zeros, Neyman
   type A, logarithmic with zeros, and Poisson-binomial) did not fit the
   data as consistently as the negative binomial distribution, Associated
   with the negative binomial distribution is a k parameter, k is a
   nonspatial aggregation parameter related to the variance at a given mean
   value, The k parameter of the negative binomial distribution was
   consistent across weed density for individual weed species in a given
   field except for foxtail spp, populations, Stability of the k parameter
   across field sites was assessed using the likelihood ratio test, There
   was no stable or common k value across held sites and years for all weed
   species populations, The lack of stability in k across field sites is of
   concern, because this parameter is used extensively in the development
   of parametric sequential sampling procedures, Because k is not stable
   across field sites, k must be estimated at the time of sampling,
   Understanding the variability in k is critical to the development of
   parametric sequential sampling strategies and understanding the dynamics
   of weed species in the field.}},

Title = {{Measurement of the impedance of aqueous solutions of KCl: An analysis
   using an extension of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the frequency dependence of the real and imaginary parts
   of the electric impedance of a cell with titanium electrodes, filled
   with aqueous solution of KCl in different concentrations. Our
   experimental data are interpreted by means of an extension of the
   Poisson-Nernst-Planck model, assuming that the electrodes are not
   blocking and well described by Ohmic boundary conditions, and that two
   groups of ions are responsible for the electric conduction. One group is
   due to the dissociation of KCl in water (majority carriers), the other
   to the impurities dissolved in water or present in KCl (minority
   carriers), whose bulk density is very small with respect to first group.
   The agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical
   predictions is good, taking into account the small number of free
   parameters entering in the model. In particular, the diffusion
   coefficient for the potassium and chloride ions well comparer with those
   reported in literature. According to our analysis, the role of the
   carriers related to the impurities present in the solution play a
   fundamental role in the fit of the experimental data in the low
   frequency region. The presented model where two groups of ions are
   present, with the assumption of equal mobilities for positive and
   negative charges in a group, is motivated by the experimental evidence
   that in aqueous solution of KCl, K+, and Cl- have approximately the same
   mobilities. Since the PNP model for an electrolytic solution of the case
   considered by us predicts an electric response similar to that of an
   electrolytic solution where the positive and negative ions have
   different mobility, a comparison with the results reported recently by
   Macdonald is presented {[}J. R. Macdonald, Electrochim. Acta, 123, 535
   (2014)]. Alternative interpretation of our experimental results related
   to the assumption of non-blocking electrodes is also discussed. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The data analyzed in this paper are part of the results described in
   Bueno et al. (2000). Three cytogenetics endpoints were analyzed in three
   populations of a species of wild rodent - Akodon montensis - living in
   an industrial, an agricultural, and a preservation area at the Itajai
   Valley, State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The
   polychromatic/normochromatic ratio, the mitotic index, and the frequency
   of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocites were used in an attempt to
   establish a genotoxic profile of each area. It was assumed that the
   three populations were in the same conditions with respect to the
   influence of confounding factors such as animal age, health, nutrition
   status, presence of pathogens, and intra- and inter-populational genetic
   variability. Therefore, any differences found in the endpoints analyzed
   could be attributed to the external agents present in each area. The
   statistical models used in this paper are mixtures of negative-binomials
   and Poisson variables. The Poisson variables are used as approximations
   of binomials for rare events. The mixing distributions are beta
   densities. The statistical analyzes are under the bayesian perspective,
   as opposed to the frequentist ones often considered in the literature,
   as for instance in Bueno et al. (2000).}},

Title = {{Mechanical properties of hierarchical anti-tetrachiral metastructures}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{18-32}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Chiral structures consisting of circular ring nodes and tangentially
   connected ligaments are engineered systems that exhibit excellent
   flexibility, vibration attenuation, impact resistance performance, etc.
   In this paper, we proposed an innovative hierarchical anti-tetrachiral
   structures based on the auxetic deformation behaviors of
   anti-tetrachiral unit cell at different structural hierarchical levels.
   The in-plane mechanical properties of hierarchical anti-tetrachiral
   metastructures are deduced from strain energy analysis, experimental and
   finite element analysis (FEA) comparisons are employed for verification.
   The in-plane mechanical properties of hierarchical anti-tetrachiral
   metastructures can be remarkably enhanced and manipulated through
   combining the auxetic deformation behaviors of chiral structures and the
   mechanical benefits of structural hierarchy, and its tunable mechanical
   properties can be designed within very large range of modulus and
   Poisson's ratio value. Finally, an innovative hierarchical
   anti-tetrachiral stent is proposed, and the interaction between stent
   and artery vessel are studied, demonstrating the promising industrial
   application potential of hierarchical chiral metastructures. The
   proposed chiral geometry represents a new family of chiral hierarchical
   structures, and the extent of auxeticity and its in-plane mechanical
   properties can be tuned through manipulating node ring size and shape,
   length and thickness, and the hierarchy level, thus achieving desired
   extreme mechanical properties. It is believed that this work can greatly
   expand the potential applications of chiral metamaterials in conformable
   and stretchable electronics, biomedical devices, electronic skin,
   stents, and reconfigurable soft robotics, etc. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The effects of clustered line patterns of hydroxyl functionalization and
   percent surface coverage along the armchair and zigzag directions of the
   graphene lattice on the mechanical response of graphene sheets (GS)
   under tension loading, in zigzag and armchair directions, and under
   shear loading in the zigzag direction were studied. The initial,
   functionalization induced bending deformation, caused by clustered line
   pattern arrangements, led to strong elastic anisotropy of graphene with
   an increased linear compressibility in the direction perpendicular to
   the line patterns and increased stiffness in the direction parallel to
   the line patterns. The line pattern functionalized graphene acted
   similar to a nanoscale mechanical spring. It is shown that clustered
   line pattern functionalization along the zigzag direction can increase
   the stiffness of the GS along the zigzag direction and stretchability
   along the armchair direction without significantly stretching the carbon
   bonds and can enhance the toughness of the GS relative to random
   functionalization. It was also found that the Poisson's ratio can be
   tuned from positive to negative through line pattern arrangements,
   reaching a minimum of -0.287 at an -OH percentage of 75\% for stretching
   along the zigzag direction, thus indicating auxetic behavior. (c) 2019

Abstract = {{Upon strain, most materials shrink normal to the direction of applied
   strain. Similarly, if a material is compressed, it will expand in the
   direction orthogonal to the pressure. Few materials, those of negative
   Poisson ratio, show the opposite behavior. Here, we show an
   unprecedented feature, a material that expands normal to the direction
   of stress, regardless if it is strained or compressed. Such behavior,
   namely, half-auxeticity, is demonstrated for a borophene sheet
   stabilized by decorating Pd atoms. We explore Pd-decorated borophene,
   identify three stable phases of which one has this peculiar property of
   half auxeticity. After carefully analyzing stability and mechanical and
   electronic properties we explore the origin of this very uncommon
   behavior and identify it as a structural feature that may also be
   employed to design further 2D nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are under great attention of researchers due to their
   excellent mechanical response under certain conditions. Previous works
   have been carried out in knitted or uni-stretch woven fabrics. In the
   present study, three-dimensional (3D) woven structures were produced and
   the effect of float length of ground weave and binding yarn on
   auxeticity of the fabric was investigated. Eight different 3D orthogonal
   woven structures/reinforcements were produced on rapier dobby loom by
   changing the float length in ground weave and binding yarns. Hand layup
   technique was used for composite fabrication, while green epoxy resin
   was used as a matrix. For investigating the auxeticity, 3D reinforcement
   samples were subjected to tensile loading and change in their thickness
   was measured. The results showed that 3D woven reinforcements with equal
   and maximum float length of ground weave and binding yarn showed greater
   auxetic behavior, because both weaves support each other and room for
   opening of structure increases. As the difference between the float
   length of ground weave and binding yarns increases, the auxeticity of
   reinforcement decreases because the ground weave and binding yarn cancel
   out the effect of each other. Moreover, the impact energy absorption of
   the developed composites was found to increase with the increase in
   float length, justifying that the structures are auxetic in nature.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{178-186}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials usually refer to artificial composite materials consisting
   of an array of periodically arranged microstructures, engineered to
   provide unusual material properties that may not be easily found in
   nature. This paper proposes a new topological shape optimization method
   for systematic computational design of a type of mechanical
   metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic materials), which
   integrates the numerical homogenization approach into a powerful
   parametric level set method (PLSM). The homogenization method is used to
   obtain the effective properties of the periodic microstructure, while
   the PLSM is applied to achieve shape evolutions and topological changes
   of the microstructure, until the desired material properties are
   achieved. The key concept of the PLSM is the interpolation of the
   implicit level set surface by using a given set of compactly supported
   radial basis functions (CSRBF), which are positioned at a number of
   given and fixed knots inside the design domain. Several typical
   numerical examples are used to demonstrate the favorable characteristics
   of the proposed method in the design of micro-structured metamaterials.

Abstract = {{In this report, we investigate the physical and dynamical properties of
   model fluids whose constituent particles have their softness varied in a
   systematic manner. Molecular dynamics ( MD) computer simulation is
   applied to inverse power or soft-sphere fluids, in which the particles
   interact through the pair potential, phi(r) = epsilon(sigma/r)(n) where
   n measures the steepness or stiffness of the potential. We have
   investigated the properties of model fluids with 4 <= n <= n 1152 over a
   wide density range. Attention is paid to local structural properties,
   the elastic moduli and the transport coefficients ( principally the
   shear viscosity, eta(s) and self-diffusion coefficient, D). We note that
   this is the first time mechanical and transport coefficient data have
   been reported for n = 4: It was found that the Batschinski - Hildebrand
   expressions, in which D and eta(-1)(s) are assumed to have a linear
   dependence on the molar volume, represent the data quite well for all n.
   The density for which, on extrapolation, each of these quantities are
   zero, increases with the softness of the interaction (or similar to
   n(-1)), suggesting that the effective hard sphere diameter decreases
   with increasing softness in the small n limit. This treatment leads to
   simple empirical formulas for the effect of density ( in an intermediate
   range) and n on the two transport coefficients of these fluids. As n
   decreases so do the relative fluctuations in the pressure and force on a
   particle. The local coordination number as measured up to the first
   minimum in the radial distribution function does not increase
   significantly above similar or equal to 13 up to the co-existence
   packing fluid, even for the softest of particles (i:e: n = 4). If we
   assume that the effective hard sphere diameter is approximately the
   position of the first peak in the radial distribution function, the
   Stokes - Einstein expression reproduces the simulation data reasonably
   well, with the boundary condition being typically between the stick and
   slip limits, and approaching the latter with increasing density. For the
   softer particles and with increasing packing fraction, the shear
   viscosity increases more rapidly than the self-diffusion coefficient
   decreases. For the softer systems, the bulk viscosity is relatively low
   compared to the shear viscosity, in contrast to the trend for the
   corresponding infinite frequency moduli. The softer particles are more
   ``rubbery{''} in their response ( relatively high bulk modulus compared
   to the shear modulus), which leads us to conclude that auxetic behaviour
   is more likely to arise when the building units are quite hard.}},

Abstract = {{A recent finite-element method (FEM)-based study from the present
   authors quantified the effect of elastic anisotropy of grains on stress
   intensification at potential intergranular stress corrosion cracking
   (IGSCC) initiation sites in austenitic stainless steels. In particular,
   it showed that the auxetic behavior of grains (negative Poisson's ratio)
   in some directions plays a very important role in IGSCC initiation,
   since it can induce local stress intensification factors of about 1.6. A
   similar effect is expected for other fcc alloys such as Ni-based alloys.
   The present article confirms those results and paves the way to the
   definition of an IGSCC susceptibility index by identifying grain
   configurations that are the most favorable for crack initiation. The
   index will rely on the probability to get those configurations on
   surface of specimens. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Examples of chiral materials include some auxetic materials, carbon
   nanotubes, bones, various honeycomb structures, as well as some
   composites. The chiral effects cannot be described by means of the
   classical theories of continua. In the context of the linear theory of
   Cosserat thermoelasticity we investigate the behaviour of a chiral rod
   subjected to a thermal field independent of the axial coordinate. The
   work is motivated by the recent interest in the using of the Cosserat
   solid as model for auxetic materials, carbon nanotubes, and bones. It is
   shown that the temperature field produces torsion, extension, bending,
   and a plane strain. The results are used to investigate the case of a
   circular cylinder subjected to a uniform temperature field. The salient
   feature of the solution is that a constant temperature field in an
   isotropic chiral circular rod produces a twist around its axis. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The bivariate negative binomial regression (BNBR) and the bivariate
   Poisson log-normal regression (BPLR) models have been used to describe
   count data that are over-dispersed. In this paper, a new bivariate
   generalized Poisson regression (BGPR) model is defined. An advantage of
   the new regression model over the BNBR and BPLR models is that the BGPR
   can be used to model bivariate count data with either over-dispersion or
   under-dispersion. In this paper, we carry out a simulation study to
   compare the three regression models when the true data-generating
   process exhibits over-dispersion. In the simulation experiment, we
   observe that the bivariate generalized Poisson regression model performs
   better than the bivariate negative binomial regression model and the

Title = {{The effect of protein dielectric coefficient on the ionic selectivity of
   a calcium channel}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{Calcium-selective ion channels are known to have carboxylate-rich
   selectivity filters, a common motif that is primarily responsible for
   their high Ca2+ affinity. Different Ca2+ affinities ranging from
   micromolar (the L-type Ca channel) to millimolar (the ryanodine receptor
   channel) are closely related to the different physiological functions of
   these channels. To understand the physical mechanism for this range of
   affinities given similar amino acids in their selectivity filters, we
   use grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations to assess the binding of
   monovalent and divalent ions in the selectivity filter of a model Ca
   channel. We use a reduced model where the electolyte is modeled by
   hard-sphere ions embedded in a continuum dielectric solvent, while the
   interior of protein surrounding the channel is allowed to have a
   dielectric coefficient different from that of the electrolyte. The
   induced charges that appear on the protein/lumen interface are
   calculated by the induced charge computation method {[}Boda , Phys. Rev.
   E 69, 046702 (2004)]. It is shown that decreasing the dielectric
   coefficient of the protein attracts more cations into the pore because
   the protein's carboxyl groups induce negative charges on the dielectric
   boundary. As the density of the hard-sphere ions increases in the
   filter, Ca2+ is absorbed into the filter with higher probability than
   Na+ because Ca2+ provides twice the charge to neutralize the negative
   charge of the pore (both structural carboxylate oxygens and induced
   charges) than Na+ while occupying about the same space (the charge/space
   competition mechanism). As a result, Ca2+ affinity is improved an order
   of magnitude by decreasing the protein dielectric coefficient from 80 to
   5. Our results indicate that adjusting the dielectric properties of the
   protein surrounding the permeation pathway is a possible way for
   evolution to regulate the Ca2+ affinity of the common four-carboxylate
   motif.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we establish the negative spontaneous magnetization in Mn
   and Zn substituted cobalt ferrite Co0.6Zn0.4Fe1.7Mn0.3O4 (CZFMO). It is
   suggested that the origin of negative spontaneous magnetization is due
   to the substitution of small sized Mn+4 ions (compared to Fe+3 ions) at
   the octahedral B site in compound Co0.6Zn0.4 Fe2O4. The low value of
   Poisson's ratio similar to 0.202 for this compound possibly contributes
   towards the easy distortion in the bond length and bond angle, causing
   increase in Fe-O bond distance/decrease in Fe-O-Fe bond angle with Mn
   substitution, leading to considerably weak Fe-O-Fe superexchange
   interaction at the octahedral B site. The neutron diffraction data
   clearly illustrated the significant reduction in ordered magnetic moment
   at the B site, with the resultant negative spontaneous magnetization (M
   = M-B - M-A) in this mixed spinel system. The spin disorder also gives
   rise to an interesting semi-spin glass behavior in CZFMO. (C) 2015 AIP

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a method to design the periodic microstructure of a
   material to obtain prescribed constitutive properties. The
   microstructure is modelled as a truss or thin frame structure in 2 and 3
   dimensions. The problem of finding the simplest possible microstructure
   with the prescribed elastic properties can be called an inverse
   homogenization problem, and is formulated as an optimization problem of
   finding a microstructure with the lowest possible weight which fulfils
   the specified behavioral requirements. A full ground structure known
   from topology optimization of trusses is used as starting guess for the
   optimization algorithm. This implies that the optimal microstructure of
   a base cell is found from a truss or frame structure with 120 possible
   members in the 2-dimensional case and 2016 possible members in the
   3-dimensional case. The material parameters are found by a numerical
   homogenization method, using Finite-Elements to model the representative
   base cell, and the optimization problem is solved by an optimality
   criteria method.
   Numerical examples in two and three dimensions show that it is possible
   to design materials with many different properties using base cells
   modelled as truss or frame works. Hereunder is shown that it is possible
   to tailor extreme materials, such as isotropic materials with Poisson's
   ratio close to - 1, 0 and 0.5, by the proposed method. Some of the
   proposed materials have been tested as macro models which demonstrate
   the expected behaviour.}},

Title = {{Improving the Blast Resistance of Large Steel Gates-Numerical Study}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Blast resistant gates/doors are essential for sensitive infrastructure,
   such as embassies, ministries, or parliaments. Lightweight gates
   equipped with `energy absorbing systems' have better operational
   performance than the traditional costly and bulky design. Graded auxetic
   structures have not yet been used as potential passive damping systems
   in the supporting frame of blast resistant gates. Consequently, this
   study tries to test if a uniaxial graded auxetic damper (UGAD) proposed
   by the authors in a recent article, namely the development of a new
   shock absorbing UGAD, could maintain a 3000 mm x 4500 mm steel gate
   operable after high blast peak reflected overpressure of 6.6 MPa, from
   100 kg TNT at 5 m stand-off distance. The blast-induced response of the
   gate was assessed, with and without the proposed UGAD, using
   Abaqus/Explicit solver. Results showed that the attachment of the
   proposed UGAD to the gate led to a dramatic decrease in permanent
   deformations (a critical factor for gate operability after a blast
   event). Hence, a lighter, more economical gate (with 50\% reduction in
   mass) was required to satisfy the operability condition. In addition,
   49\% of peak reaction forces were diminished, that have a direct impact
   on the supporting frame. Moreover, the results revealed that, in the
   numerical model, 56\% of the achieved plastic dissipation energy was
   from the UGADs, and 44\% from the gate. The outcomes of this research
   may have a positive impact on other sectors beyond academia, such as
   industry, economy, and public safety.}},

Title = {{Application of the Tweedie distribution to zero-catch data in CPUE
   analysis}},
Journal = {{FISHERIES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{154-162}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{We focus on the zero-catch problem of CPUE (catch per unit effort)
   standardization. Because the traditional CPUE model with a log-normal
   error structure cannot be applied in this case, three methods have often
   been utilized as follows:
   (1) Ad hoc method adds a small constant value to all response variables,
   (2) Catch model with a Poisson or negative-binomial (NB) error
   structure.
   (3) Delta-type two-step method such as the delta-normal model (after
   estimating the ratio of zero-catch using
   a logit or probit model, a model Such as CPUE log-normal or
   Catch-Poisson is applied to CPUE Without zero-data).
   However, there are some statistical problems with each of these methods.
   In this paper, we carried ou the CPUE standardization mainly using the
   Tweedie distribution model based on the actual by-catch data (silky
   shark, Carcharhimus falciformis, in the North Pacific Ocean caught by
   Japanese training vessels) including many observations with zero-catch
   (> 2/3rd) and tuna fishery data as a target (yellowfin tuna, Thunnus
   albacares, in the Indian Ocean caught by Japanese commercial vessels)
   where the ratio of zero-catch is not so high (< 1/3rd). The Tweedie
   model is an extension of compound Poisson model derived from the
   stochastic process where the weight of the counted objects (i.e., number
   of fish) has a gamma distribution and has an advantage of handling the
   zero-catch data in a unified way.
   We also compared four candidate models, the Catch-NB model, ad hoc
   method, Delta-lognormal model (delta-type two-step method) and Tweedie
   distribution, through CPUE analyses of actual fishery data in terms of
   the statistical performance. Square error and Pearson's correlation
   coefficient were calculated based oil the observed CPUE and the
   corresponding predicted CPUE using the n-fold cross-validation.
   As a result, the differences in the trend of CPUE between years and
   model performance between the ad hoc method and Tweedie model were found
   to be not so large in the example of yellowfin tuna (target species).
   However, the statistical performance of Tweedie distribution is rather
   better than Delta-lognormal model, the Catch-NB distribution and ad hoc
   method in the example of silky shark (by-catch species). Standardized
   CPUE year trend of ad hoc method was found to be quite different from
   that of the Tweedie distribution and other two models. Model performance
   of the Tweedie distribution is good judging from the 5-fold
   cross-validation using the fishery data if including many zero-catch
   data such as by-catch species. C 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Profiling analysis aims to evaluate health care providers, such as
   hospitals, nursing homes, or dialysis facilities, with respect to a
   patient outcome. Previous profiling methods have considered binary
   outcomes, such as 30-day hospital readmission or mortality. For the
   unique population of dialysis patients, regular blood works are required
   to evaluate effectiveness of treatment and avoid adverse events,
   including dialysis inadequacy, imbalance mineral levels, and anemia
   among others. For example, anemic events (when hemoglobin levels exceed
   normative range) are recurrent and common for patients on dialysis.
   Thus, we propose high-dimensional Poisson and negative binomial
   regression models for rate/count outcomes and introduce a standardized
   event ratio measure to compare the event rate at a specific facility
   relative to a chosen normative standard, typically defined as an
   ``average{''} national rate across all facilities. Our proposed
   estimation and inference procedures overcome the challenge of
   high-dimensional parameters for thousands of dialysis facilities. Also,
   we investigate how overdispersion affects inference in the context of
   profiling analysis. The proposed methods are illustrated with profiling
   dialysis facilities for recurrent anemia events.}},

Abstract = {{The Nastapoka Arc, on the east coast of Hudson Bay, is almost perfectly
   circular and closely follows the unconformable contact between Archean
   Superior province gneisses and shallowly seaward dipping early
   Proterozoic Nastapoka Group supracrustals.  Its form may be explained by
   flexing of the lithosphere due to loading by thrust sheets from the
   Trans-Hudson orogen to the west.  Such flexing produces a peripheral
   bulge east of the coast which should be reflected in a positive gravity
   anomaly there.  Gravity data averaged around the arc show such a
   positive anomaly, although its precise amplitude is uncertain because of
   local variation in the gravity field.  Lithospheric flexure of the arc
   due to loading can be modeled by superposition of disc-shaped loads
   centered on the arc.  For a lithospheric Young's modulus of 1.0 x 10(11)
   N m-2 and Poisson's ratio 0.25, the present geometry of the arc can be
   reproduced only by reducing the elastic thickness to 20 +/- 2 km.  The
   peripheral bulge predicted for the model yields a gravity anomaly very
   similar to that observed if it is fully imaged at the Moho.  The absence
   of a regional negative gravity anomaly over the arc, despite a great
   thickness of transported rocks present at its center, requires that the
   crust in the region was unusually thin before thrust emplacement.  The
   unusually low elastic thickness required for the model may reflect
   highly fractured crust.  Both features are consistent with the former
   presence of a rifted continental margin in the region, as predicted for
   many models of the Trans-Hudson orogen.}},

Title = {{Use of Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression to examine the effect
   of distance on Tuberculosis incidence: A case study in Nam Dinh, Vietnam}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   This study aimed to examine the potential of combining routine
   tuberculosis (TB) surveillance and demographic and socioeconomic
   variables into the Geographic Information System (GIS) to describe the
   geographical distribution of TB notified incidence in relation to
   distances to health services as well as local demographic and
   socioeconomic factors, including population density, urban/rural status,
   and household poverty rates in Nam Dinh, Vietnam. It also aimed to
   compare the conventional Generalized Linear Models (GLM) Poisson
   regression model and Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR)
   models in order to determine the best fitting model that can be used to
   investigate the relationship between TB notified incidence and distances
   and the social risk factors.
   Methods
   The data of new and relapse patients with all forms of TB aged >= 15
   years residing in Nam Dinh (Vietnam) from 2012 to 2015 were collected
   from the Administration of Medical Services' (Ministry of Health of
   Vietnam) TB surveillance database. Data on the population and household
   poverty rates from 2012 to 2015 were gathered from the Nam Dinh
   Statistical Office. Distances between communes and the nearest TB
   diagnostic facilities in districts were computed. The TB notified
   incidence per 100,000 population was denoted by indirect age and sex
   standardized incidence ratio. GLM Poisson regression and GWPR were
   performed to assess the relationship between distance and TB incidence.
   Results
   The average notified TB incidence level measured from 2012 to 2015 is 82
   per 100,000 population (range: 79-84/100,000). The distance to the
   nearest TB diagnosis presents a negative effect on TB notified
   incidence. By capturing spatial heterogeneity, the GWPR may be better at
   fitting data (corrected Aikake information criterion {[}AICc] = 245.71,
   residual deviance = 221.12) than the traditional GLM (AICc = 251.53,
   residual deviance = 241.21)
   Conclusions
   GIS technologies benefit TB surveillance system. Distances should be
   considered when planning methods of improving access for those who live
   far from TB diagnostic services, thereby improving TB detection.
   Additional studies must confirm the association between geographic
   distance and TB case detection and must explore other factors that may
   affect TB notified incidence.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) need a high mechanical stability to be
   robust for industrial applications, like gas storage and catalysis.
   Their adsorption properties also correlate with the structure
   flexibility, which leads to the so-called breathing phenomenon. Finding
   relations between geometrical and topological descriptors and mechanical
   properties is important for explaining and predicting mechanical
   behavior of both synthesized and hypothetical MOFs. To address this, we
   present the full tensor DFT analysis of the second-order elastic
   constants for 22 either rigid or flexible MOFs assembled from rod
   secondary building units (rod MOFs) and related to 7 topological types
   of underlying nets: 4/5/t1, bik, crb, dia, gis, cda, and mog. The
   calculated values of the Young's and shear moduli, linear
   compressibility, and Poisson's ratio have found a good agreement with
   experimental observations. We have shown that the
   geometrical-topological features of the coordination framework
   predetermine the general form of the elastic tensor, while variations in
   the MOF composition tune the mechanical properties in specific
   directions. We report for the first time a negative linear
   compressibility for the CAU-10-OCH3, NOTT-401, MIL-60, MIL-116, and
   MIL-118 frameworks. We have also revealed that the breathing behavior of
   six rod MOFs of the MIL-53, MIL-118, and CAU-10 families is caused by
   compliant geometrical-topological patterns and ligand-ligand
   interactions. The proposed classification of the geometrical-topological
   patterns into compliant and noncompliant can be used to search for and
   to design breathing MOFs.}},

Title = {{Pressure-induced hydrogen bond symmetrization of InOOH and its elastic
   properties}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Pressure-induced hydrogen bond symmetrization of InOOH as well as its
   effects on the elastic properties is investigated by first-principles
   simulation. The results indicate that the hydrogen bond in InOOH
   symmetrized at about 18 GPa, resulting in the pressure derivative of the
   b/c axial ratio changing from negative to positive. While the a/c axial
   ratio increases with the increasing pressure over a range of 0-40 GPa,
   its pressure derivative does not change significantly across the
   hydrogen bond symmetrization.
   In the text, `A-InOOH' denotes the asymmetric hydrogen bond phase and
   `S-InOOH' refers to the symmetric hydrogen bond phase. The compressional
   and off-diagonal elastic constants, bulk modulus B, Poisson's ratio
   upsilon, B/G (G represents shear modulus) and longitudinal wave velocity
   V P increase with the increasing pressure in both A-InOOH and S-InOOH.
   These properties of A-InOOH are significantly smaller than those of
   S-InOOH, and therefore they increase abnormally during the hydrogen bond
   symmetrization, such as a 20\%-40\% increase of the bulk modulus. Shear
   modulus G and Young's modulus E increase with the increasing pressure in
   A-InOOH, but decrease with the increasing pressure in S-InOOH, implying
   that hydrogen bond symmetrization would change their pressure evolution
   trends obviously. Shear elastic constant C-44 and shear wave velocity VS
   decrease with the increasing pressure in both A-InOOH and S-InOOH, and
   more quickly in the latter, indicating that the structure change of
   hydrogen bond would change their pressure evolution rates. The Young's
   moduli along the {[}100], {[}010] and {[}001] directions increase with
   the increasing pressure in A-InOOH, while decrease with the increasing
   pressure in S-InOOH, and those along the {[}110], {[}(1) over bar 10],
   {[}(1) over bar(1) over bar0] and {[}1 (1) over bar0] directions always
   increase with the increasing pressure over a range of 0-40 GPa. The
   anisotropy and toughness of InOOH increase with the increasing pressure
   in both A-InOOH and S-InOOH, and the hydrogen bond symmetrization
   results in abnormal increase. In the materials containing hydrogen
   bonds, the effects of hydrogen bond symmetrization on different
   compressional elastic constants depend on the hydrogen bond projection
   on corresponding axes: the bigger the projection, the more significant
   the effect is.
   InOOH has an obviously smaller bulk modulus than delta-AlOOH. The
   dominant reason is that the In 3+ radius (0.81 angstrom, 1 angstrom =
   0.1 nm) is larger than Al3+ radius (0.50 angstrom), resulting in the
   weaker interaction between Al3+ and O-2 than that between Al3 + and O-2.
   In addition, InOOH has more vacancies than delta-AlOOH. Combining with
   previous investigations on other rutile-distorted M OOH (M = Al, Ga, Fe,
   Cr), we can infer that the axial ratios, elastic properties and wave
   velocities of all M OOH materials have similar pressure evolutions to
   those of InOOH, and the hydrogen bond symmetrization has similar effects
   on the properties of MOOH.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the local determinants of destination choices of foreign
   immigrants to the Madrid metro area using data for 2005 and 2009 from
   the Spanish annual municipal-level registers of inhabitants. Taking
   advantage of the equivalence relation between conditional logit and
   Poisson, we estimate a location-choice model using the Poisson
   fixed-effects estimator. Origin-destination fixed effects are
   incorporated to account for the persistent spatial structure of the
   immigrants' settlement patterns and to control for potential violations
   of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption. The
   Poisson regression model is estimated for seven different groups of
   immigrants according to world regions or countries of origin. Our
   modelling strategy has important empirical implications, with magnitudes
   and/or signs of the estimated coefficients changing in the expected
   directions. It is found that newly arriving immigrants tend to settle in
   low-to-middle-income locations in the suburban reaches of the Madrid
   metro area. Moreover, the effects of the size of local communities of
   established immigrants are found to be insignificant and even negative
   in several instances, reflecting hetero-local settlement preferences
   and/or the saturation of local networks causing in-group job rivalry,
   respectively.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This study estimated the prevalence of negative self-perception of smile
   because of occlusion abnormalities and investigated their association
   according to standard clinical criteria. The sample consisted of 1290
   randomly selected Brazilian adolescent boys and girls aged 12-16 years.
   The outcome of interest was dissatisfaction with smile, and data were
   collected using a standardized questionnaire. Occlusion characteristics
   were assessed using the dental aesthetic index (DAI). The other study
   variables were gender, age, and use of dental services. A chi-square
   test and Poisson multiple regression were used for statistical analysis.
   Of the 1290 students interviewed and examined, 539 (41.8 per cent) were
   dissatisfied with their smile; of these, 373 (69.2 per cent) assigned
   their dissatisfaction to the presence of an occlusal abnormality, and
   166 (30.8 per cent) reported reasons other than occlusal abnormalities
   for their negative self-perception of their smile. In multivariate
   analysis, the following variables were associated with the outcome of
   interest: maxillary anterior irregularity {[}prevalence ratio (PR) =
   1.40; 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) = 1.29-1.80], incisal spacing
   (PR = 1.37; 95 per cent CI = 1.19-1.57), vertical open bite (PR = 1.34;
   95 per cent CI = 1.15-1.55), mandibular anterior irregularity (PR =
   1.29; 95 per cent CI = 1.14-1.46), permanent anterior teeth missing (PR
   = 1.21; 95 per cent CI = 1.05-1.39), and incisal diastema (PR = 1.14; 95
   per cent CI = 1.01-1.31). The negative self-perception of smile was
   statistically associated with severity of occlusal disorders according
   to the DAI scores, which suggests that self-perception should be used
   together with standard clinical criteria when decisions about
   orthodontic treatments are made in public health care systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We investigated whether the reported lower incidence of
   prostate cancer in HIV-positive men is a result of confounding factors
   or reduced screening.
   Methods: We conducted a cohort study of 17,424 HIV-positive and 182,799
   HIV-negative men enrolled in Kaiser Permanente (KP). Subjects were
   followed from the first KP enrollment after January 01, 1996 for KP
   Northern California (KPNC) and January 01, 2000 for KP Southern
   California until the earliest of prostate cancer diagnosis, loss to
   follow-up, or December 31, 2007. Poisson regression was used to compare
   cancer rates by HIV status adjusting for age, race, smoking,
   alcohol/drug abuse, overweight/obesity, and diabetes. For the KPNC
   subset, we analyzed additional available data by HIV status on
   testosterone deficiency, and on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests as
   a proxy for cancer screening.
   Results: The prostate cancer incidence rate was 102/100,000 person-years
   in HIV-positive men (n = 74 cases) and 131/100,000 person-years in
   HIV-negative men (n = 1195 cases), with an adjusted rate ratio of 0.73
   (95\% confidence interval: 0.57 to 0.92; P = 0.008). The reduced risk
   among HIV-positive men was greater for higher-stage cancers, which are
   less likely to be biased by screening differences than lower-stage
   cancers. In the KPNC subset, more HIV-positive (90.8\%) than
   HIV-negative men (86.2\%) received a PSA test by age 55 (P < 0.001).
   Decreased risk for HIV-positive men remained when examined only among
   those with a previous PSA test, and with adjustment for testosterone
   deficiency (rate ratio = 0.55; 95\% confidence interval: 0.39 to 0.80; P
   = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Prostate cancer incidence rates are lower in HIV-positive
   compared with HIV-negative men, which is not explained by screening
   differences or the risk factors evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we give a review of the state of the art in the study of
   mechanical metamaterials. The very attractive property of having a
   microstructure capable of determining exotic and specifically tailored
   macroscopic behaviour makes the study of metamaterials a field that is
   actually in expansion, from both a theoretical and a technological point
   of view. This work is divided into two sections, describing the
   phenomenological and theoretical aspects of metamaterials. We first give
   an overview of some existing metamaterials, such as pentamode materials,
   auxetic materials, materials with negative mechanical constitutive
   coefficients and materials with enhanced mechanical properties. We also
   focus on some emerging areas, such as origami. Then, we present some
   theoretical studies in the field of mechanical metamaterials, such as
   those related to first- and second-gradient theories.}},

Abstract = {{The first-principle calculations were performed to investigate the
   structural, mechanical, electronic and thermal properties of the binary
   ductile intermetallic compound CeAg with B2 (CsCl) structure. The
   calculated value of lattice constant a(0) for CeAg with generalized
   gradient approximation is 3.713 angstrom, which is in better agreement
   with experimental data than local spin density approximation. The
   negative energy of formation implies that CeAg with B2 structure is
   thermodynamically stable phase. The greater separation between the d
   bands of Ce and Ag results in weaker bond hybridization of Ce d-Ag d,
   which prevents formation of directional covalent bonding. The three
   independent elastic constants (C-11, C-12 and C-44) are derived and the
   bulk modulus, shear modulus, elastic modulus, anisotropy factor, and
   Poisson ratio are determined to be 57.6 GPa, 15.8 GPa, 43.4 GPa, 3.15
   and 0.374, respectively. The elastic constants meet all the mechanical
   stability criteria. The value of Pugh's criterion is 3.65. The ductility
   of CeAg is predicted if Pugh's criterion is greater than 1.75.
   Furthermore, the variations of volume, bulk modulus, heat capacity, and
   thermal expansion coefficient with temperature and/or pressure were
   calculated and discussed.}},

Title = {{Estimating treatment efficacy over time: a logistic regression model for

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a case study in longitudinal data analysis where the
   goal is to estimate the efficacy of a new drug for treatment of a severe
   chronic constipation. Data consist of long sequences of binary outcomes
   (relief/no relief) on each of a large number of patients randomized to
   treatment (low and high dose) or placebo. Data characteristics indicate:
   (1) the treatment effects vary non-linearly with time; (2) there is
   substantial heterogeneity across subjects in their responses to
   treatment; and (3) there is a high proportion of subjects who never
   experience any relief (the non-responders).
   To overcome these challenges, we develop a hierarchical model for binary
   longitudinal data with a mixture distribution on the probability of
   response to account for the high frequency of non-responders. While the
   model is specified conditionally on subject-specific latent variables,
   we also draw inferences on key population-average parameters for the
   assessment of the treatments' efficacy in a population. In addition we
   employ a model-checking method to compare the goodness-of-fit for our
   model against simpler modelling approaches for aggregated counts, such
   as the zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models.
   We estimate subject-specific and population-average rate ratios of
   relief for the treatment with respect to the placebo as functions of
   time (RRt), and compare them with the rate ratios estimated from the
   models for aggregated counts. We find that: (1) the treatment is
   effective with respect to the placebo with higher efficacy at the
   beginning of the study; (2) the estimated rate ratios from the models
   for aggregated counts appear to be similar to the average across time of
   the population-average rate ratios estimated under our model; and (3)
   model-checking suggests that the hierarchical and zero-inflated negative
   binomial model fit the data best.
   If we are mainly interested to establish the overall efficacy (or
   safety) of a new drug, it is appropriate to aggregate the longitudinal
   data over time and analyse the count data by use of standard statistical
   methods. However, the models for aggregated counts cannot capture time
   trend of treatment such as the initial treatment benefit or the
   development of tolerance during the early stage of the treatment which
   may be important information to physicians to predict the treatment
   effects for their patients. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Gas transport study in the confined microfractures of coal reservoirs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{68}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Microfractures are commonly observed in coal reservoirs. During the
   coalbed gas production process, stress sensitivity and coalbed gas
   viscosity changes are significant factors that affect gas transport. By
   using research methods based on desorption theory and elastic-plastic
   mechanics, a coal confined microfracture gas transport model that
   considers dynamic microfracture width variations and gas effective
   viscosity is established in this paper. This model comprehensively fuses
   the Knudsen diffusion model, the slip flow model, the surface diffusion
   model, and the cubic grid model. The reliability of this model is
   verified via molecular simulations, and the influence factors of gas
   transport capacity in confined microfractures of coal reservoirs are
   then discussed in detail. The results demonstrate the following
   findings. (1) The analyzed flows are well simulated in coal confined
   microfractures by the model established in this paper, which considers
   stress sensitivity and coalbed methane viscosity change. (2) Under low
   formation pressure (less than 5 MPa), the effective gas viscosity
   rapidly decreases with the decrease in formation pressure, and the
   negative contribution of gas viscosity change to the microfracture
   permeability of coal is large. The smaller the initial fracture width of
   coal, the more obvious this negative effect. (3) When the initial
   fracture width is fairly small (near 1 nm), Knudsen flow and surface
   diffusion greatly contribute to the microfracture permeability of coal.
   However, the larger the initial microfracture width, the smaller the
   contribution of the two flow regimes to the microfracture permeability,
   and the permeability is mainly provided by slip flow. (4) Under given
   conditions, the microfracture permeability of coal is positively related
   to rock mechanical parameters (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) and
   negatively related to fracture compressibility. Under low formation
   pressures (less than 15 MPa), the microfracture permeability of coal is
   positively related to gas desorption. When the formation pressure
   exceeds 15 MPa, the influence of gas desorption performance on
   permeability is nearly constant.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc squarate tetrahydrate (ZnC4O4 center dot 4H(2)O) and titanium
   oxalate trioxide dihydrate (Ti-2(C2O4)O-3 center dot 2H(2)O) are
   nanoporous metal-organic frameworks possessing empty channels in their
   crystal structures. The crystal structures and mechanical properties of
   these materials are studied using first principles solid-state methods
   based on Density Functional Theory. The results show that they exhibit
   the negative linear compressibility (NLC) and negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) phenomena. The absolute value of the negative compressibilities
   are significant and the range of pressure for which NLC effects are
   shown is very wide. The detailed study of the deformation of the crystal
   structures under pressure reveals that the NLC effect in these compounds
   can be rationalized using the empty channel structural mechanism. Under
   isotropic compression, the channels are elongated along the direction of
   minimum compressibiity, leading to NLC. Furthermore, under compression
   along the direction of minimum compressibity, the unit-cell volume
   increases leading to negative volumetric compressibilty. The effect of
   hydration on the NLC effect in titanium oxalate trioxide dihydrate is
   investigated by studying the parent compound titanium oxalate trioxide
   trihydrate (Ti-2(C2O4)O-3 center dot 3H(2)O). The NLC effect in this
   material is reduced due to the reinforcement of the walls of the

Title = {{Selecting a distributional assumption for modelling relative densities

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{185}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-12}},

Abstract = {{The selection of a distributional assumption suitable for modelling
   macroinvertebrate density data is typically challenging.
   Macroinvertebrate data often exhibit substantially larger variances than
   expected under a standard count assumption, that of the Poisson
   distribution. Such overdispersion may derive from multiple sources,
   including heterogeneity of habitat (historically and spatially),
   differing life histories for organisms collected within a single
   collection in space and time, and autocorrelation. Taken to extreme,
   heterogeneity of habitat may be argued to explain the frequent large
   proportions of zero observations in macroinvertebrate data. Sampling
   locations may consist of habitats defined qualitatively as either
   suitable or unsuitable. The former category may yield random or
   stochastic zeroes and the latter structural zeroes. Heterogeneity among
   counts may be accommodated by treating the count mean itself as a random
   variable, while extra zeroes may be accommodated using zero-modified
   count assumptions, including zero-inflated and two-stage (or hurdle)
   approaches. These and linear assumptions (following log- and square
   root-transformations) were evaluated using 9 years of mayfly density
   data from a 52km, ninth-order reach of the Upper Mississippi River
   (n=959). The data exhibited substantial overdispersion relative to that
   expected under a Poisson assumption (i.e. variance:mean ratio= 23 >> 1),
   and 43\% of the sampling locations yielded zero mayflies. Based on the
   Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), count models were improved most by
   treating the count mean as a random variable (via a Poisson-gamma
   distributional assumption) and secondarily by zero modification (i.e.
   improvements in AIC values = 9184 units and 47-48 units, respectively).
   Zeroes were underestimated by the Poisson, log-transform and square
   root-transform models, slightly by the standard negative binomial model
   but not by the zero-modified models (61\%, 24\%, 32\%, 7\%, and 0\%,
   respectively). However, the zero-modified Poisson models underestimated
   small counts (1 <= y <= 4) and overestimated intermediate counts (7 <= y
   <= 23). Counts greater than zero were estimated well by zero-modified
   negative binomial models, while counts greater than one were also
   estimated well by the standard negative binomial model. Based on AIC and
   percent zero estimation criteria, the two-stage and zero-inflated models
   performed similarly. The above inferences were largely confirmed when
   the models were used to predict values from a separate, evaluation data
   set (n = 110). An exception was that, using the evaluation data set, the
   standard negative binomial model appeared superior to its zero-modified
   counterparts using the AIC (but not percent zero criteria). This and
   other evidence suggest that a negative binomial distributional
   assumption should be routinely considered when modelling benthic
   macroinvertebrate data from low flow environments. Whether negative
   binomial models should themselves be routinely examined for extra zeroes
   requires, from a statistical perspective, more investigation. However,
   this question may best be answered by ecological arguments that may be
   specific to the sampled species and locations. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In global Earth models such as the preliminary reference Earth model
   (PREM), seismic attenuation is dominated by shear friction, which is
   expressed by the relation Q(K) >> Q(mu) between the bulk and shear Q
   factors. Weak bulk attenuation appears to be one of the most general
   observations for Earth materials, which is often used as an assumption
   for building attenuation models. Nevertheless, we consider three
   observations suggesting that Q(K) may generally be comparable to or
   below Q(mu). First, shear-dominated dissipation is a stringent limit
   requiring ``auxetic{''} behavior of materials in respect to internal
   friction, that is, analogous to elastic materials with extreme negative
   Poisson's ratios. Although possible, auxetic behavior is extremely rare
   in elasticity, and it is unlikely that it is common for internal
   friction. To avoid pervasive auxetic effects, the quality factors should
   generally satisfy Q(K) < 3: 6Q(mu). Second, the relation between Q(K)
   and Q(mu) may depend on the wave modes in which these quantities are
   measured. Knopoff (1964) observed that in mantle surface waves, Q(K) may
   be lower than Q(S) despite Q(K) >> Q(mu) in free oscillations. Third,
   many observations and micromechanics-based models of Q(K) exist,
   particularly for rock containing grains, fractures, pores, and fluids.
   Almost all of these models show Q(K) values comparable to or below Q(mu)
   within the seismic frequency band. Thus, seismic attenuation is broadly
   variable and likely not shear dominated. The relation Q(K) >> Q(mu)
   inverted for the whole Earth could be caused by the use of a constant-Q
   parameterization, whereas the Q(S) can be strongly frequency dependent
   for free oscillations. In addition, key mechanisms of anelasticity
   (nonlinear viscosity, grain-boundary sliding, effects of partial melts)
   are not of viscoelastic type and cannot be accurately described by Q
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection is the
   most common sexually transmitted infection. Penile and cervical cancer
   rates are highest in sub-Saharan Africa. However, little is known about
   the impact of HIV infection on HR-HPV acquisition and clearance among
   heterosexual men.
   Design: HR-HPV incidence and clearance were evaluated in 999 men (776
   HIV-negative and 223 HIV-positive) aged 15-49 years who participated in
   male circumcision trials in Rakai, Uganda.
   Methods: Penile swabs were tested for HR-HPV by Roche HPV Linear Array.
   A Poisson multivariable model was used to estimate adjusted incidence
   rate ratios (adjIRRs) and clearance risk ratios (adjRRs).
   Results: HR-HPV incidence was 66.5/100 person-years in HIV-positive men
   and 32.9/100 person-years among HIV-negative men {[}IRR = 2.02, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 1.67-2.44]. Incidence was higher in the
   unmarried men (adjIRR = 1.73, 95\% CI 1.19-2.52), and decreased with age
   (adjIRR for men >35 years = 0.64, 95\% CI 0.43-0.94) and male
   circumcision (adjIRR = 0.70, 95\% CI 0.55-0.89). HR-HPV clearance was
   114.7/100 person-years for HIV-positive men and 170.2/100 person-years
   for HIV-negative men (risk ratio = 0.67, 95\% CI 0.59-0.77). HR-HPV
   clearance in HIV-negative men increased with circumcision (adjRR = 1.48,
   95\% CI 1.26-1.74), HSV-2 infection (adjRR = 1.20, 95\% CI 1.01-1.44),
   and symptoms of urethral discharge (adjRR = 1.35, 95\% CI 1.06-1.73).
   Clearance of HR-HPV was significantly lower for unmarried men (adjRR
   0.76, 95\% CI 0.59-0.98).
   Conclusion: HR-HPV is common among heterosexual Ugandan men,
   particularly the HIV-infected. HIV infection increases HR-HPV
   acquisition and reduces HR-HPV clearance. Promotion of male circumcision
   and additional prevention measures, such as HPV vaccination, is critical
   in sub-Saharan Africa. (C) 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar

Abstract = {{We have proposed a mathematical method to investigate the matching
   conditions for an arterial graft in the femoral-popliteal region from a
   mechanical standpoint. Pulsatory blood flow, arterial wall motions, and
   conservation law are expressed by linear dynamical equations based on
   strict mechanical and constitutional considerations. To express the
   physiological blood flow in an actual arterial system, the tethering
   effects from the surrounding tissue and wall tensions were incorporated.
   The physiological parameters of arterial wall and tethering were
   utilized from reported experimental data. By complex analysis,
   mathematical expressions for the local impedance and reflection
   coefficient were obtained. They include not only blood properties such
   as viscosity and density, but also arterial properties including elastic
   modulus, radius, Poisson ratio, wall thickness, wall tension, frequency,
   and tethering effects from surrounding tissue. A matching condition was
   defined for minimizing the local impedance and reflection coefficient.
   The biophysical background was to reduce any mechanical mismatches, thus
   minimizing the disturbance of the now velocity profile and shear stress
   distribution within the artery. Impedance matching in turn diminishes
   the negative factors for graft substitution represented by intimal
   hyperplasia and thrombosis. The calculated impedance and reflection
   coefficient inversed parabolically to functions of the resistance of the
   host artery, and there was one host arterial resistance that minimized
   the impedance and reflection coefficient. The present analysis revealed
   that for matching host artery with an elevated resistance, the dynamic
   elastic modulus of the wall of the graft that minimizes the impedance
   and reflection coefficient was increased. This indicates that for a host
   artery with a high resistance, an impedance matched stiff wall graft is
   preferable. For a large radius and a compliant host artery on the other
   hand, a large compliant graft should be linked. The present theoretical
   matching conditions will prevent anastomotic hyperplasia and thrombosis
   in graft substitution.}},

Abstract = {{Background With more and more medical device databases being developed,
   there is an increasing interest in learning the geographical patterns of
   medical-device-related adverse events (AEs). For a specific medical
   device and an adverse event (AE) of interest, our aim is to detect a
   spatial-cluster signal that has a significantly higher AE rate than the
   AE rates for other regions, when the exposure information is available.
   Methods We develop a likelihood ratio test (LRT) method incorporating
   exposure information, by geographical region, for spatial-cluster signal
   detection when the underlying observed health outcome associated with
   the medical device of interest is a Poisson-modeled count data (e.g., an
   outcome of AE count). Results An extensive simulation study shows that
   this method has good power, sensitivity, specificity, positive
   predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). The
   application of the method is demonstrated by two hypothetical case
   studies regarding a medical device that is used for patients who have
   reached end-stage heart failure. Discussion A methodological framework
   for exploring geographic patterns in device safety surveillance is
   discussed, including safety data collection, statistical tools, and
   display of the analysis results. The proposed statistical method can be
   used for spatial-cluster signal detection for an AE of interest from
   medical device registries or other databases that have patient-level
   geographical information.}},

Pages = {{670-680}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We investigated through fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations,
   the mechanical behavior (compressive and tensile) and energy absorption
   properties of two families (primitive (P688 and P8bal) and gyroid (G688
   and G8bal)) of carbon-based schwarzites. Our results show that all
   schwarzites can be compressed (with almost total elastic recovery)
   without fracture to more than 50\%, one of them can be even remarkably
   compressed up to 80\%. One of the structures (G8bal) presents negative
   Poisson's ratio value (auxetic behavior). The crush force efficiency,
   the stroke efficiency and the specific energy absorption (SEA) values
   show that schwarzites can be effective energy absorber materials.
   Although the same level of deformation without fracture observed in the
   compressive case is not observed for the tensile case, it is still very
   high (30-40\%). The fracture dynamics show extensive structural
   reconstructions with the formation of linear atomic chains (LACs). (C)

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Poisson regression is important in the analysis of longitudinal count
   data. However, the variance of responses is often much greater than the
   sample mean in practice, contradicting the Poisson model. To solve this
   overdispersion problem, negative binomial regression model was
   introduced by earlier researchers by adding another error term to the
   Poisson model. By default, the parameter of the additional error term,
   called the overdispersion parameter, is constant during the study
   period, but we find that it may fail in the research of epilepsy. Thus a
   formal likelihood ratio test is proposed and the test conforms that a
   time-dependent overdispersion phenomenon does exist. Then a mixed effect
   negative binomial model is proposed to take into account the
   time-dependent overdispersion, producing significantly better regression
   results compared with most earlier models. The proposed test and
   regression approach can easily be done by SAS PROC NLMIXED. The
   extensive simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance
   of the methods proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{38}},

Pages = {{280-289}},
Abstract = {{The paper describes a combined analytical, numerical and experimental
   analysis on the compressive strength of hexagonal chiral honeycombs due
   to elastic buckling of the unit cells under flatwise compressive
   loading. Hexagonal chiral honeycombs are cellular structures composed
   noncentresymmetric unit cells, with an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) with a value of -1. Cylinders connected by tangent ligaments at 60
   degrees degrees compose the unit cells. Approximated analytical models
   are proposed for the purpose of initial design assuming the main
   contribution to the elastic collapse stress being given by the nodes,
   and considering also the superposition of the critical elastic loads of
   each component of the unit cell. The models are expressed in terms of
   nondimensional geometric unit cell parameters (ligament to cylinder
   radius aspect ratio and relative density), and core material properties.
   Finite element calculations using shell and brick elements are also
   performed on unit cell models with periodic boundary conditions using
   linear bifurcation buckling analysis. The analytical and numerical
   results are compared with the outcome of a series of experimental
   flatwise compressive tests carried out on chiral honeycomb samples
   manufactured using rapid prototyping technique in PA sintered powder and
   ABS plastics. The comparison shows good convergence between the sets of
   results, and highlights the specific deformation mechanisms of the
   hexagonal chiral honeycomb cell. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1111-1145}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article considers testing for independence in a time series of
   small counts within an Integer Autoregressive (INAR) model, taking a
   semiparametric approach that avoids any distributional assumption on the
   arrivals process of the model. The nature of the testing problem is
   shown to differ depending on whether or not the support of the arrivals
   distribution is the full set of natural numbers (as would be the case
   for Poisson or Negative Binomial distributions for example) or some
   strict subset of the natural numbers (such as for a Binomial or Uniform
   distribution). The theory for these two cases is studied separately.
   For the case where the arrivals have support on the natural numbers, a
   new asymptotically efficient semiparametric test, the effective score
   (Neyman-Rao) test, is derived. The semiparametric Likelihood-Ratio, Wald
   and score tests are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the
   effective score test, and hence also asymptotically efficient.
   Asymptotic relative efficiency calculations demonstrate that the
   semiparametric effective score test can provide substantial power
   advantages over the first order autocorrelation coefficient, which is
   most commonly applied in practice.
   For the case where the arrivals have support that is a strict subset of
   the natural numbers, the theory is considerably altered because the
   support of the observations becomes different under the null and
   alternative hypotheses. The semiparametric Likelihood-Ratio, Wald and
   score tests become asymptotically degenerate in this case, while the
   effective score test remains valid. Remarkably, in this case the
   effective score test is also found to have power against local
   alternatives that shrink to the null at the rate T-1. In rare cases
   where the arrival support is partly or totally known, additional tests
   exploiting this information are considered.
   Finite sample properties of the tests in these various cases demonstrate
   the semiparametric effective score test can provide substantial power
   advantages over the first order autocorrelation test implied by a
   parametric Poisson specification. The simulations also reveal situations
   in which the first order autocorrelation is preferable in finite
   samples, so a hybrid of the effective score and autocorrelation tests is
   proposed to capture most of the benefits of each test.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic chiral structures with negative Poisson ratio (NPR) can contract
   its width along the directions perpendicular to compression loading

   impact energy absorption abilities. To enhance the dynamic mechanical
   performances of periodic anti-chiral structures and hybrid-chiral

   introducing structural graded design, where the plateau stress and

Abstract = {{In this paper, an analytical multi-parameter model based on the

   laminates are investigated systematically for different cases. An
   observation of the negative in-plane Poisson's ratios for wavy laminated

Title = {{Detection of outliers in longitudinal count data via overdispersion}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS \& DATA ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{192-202}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Count data are usually modeled using the Poisson generalized linear
   model. The Poisson model requires that the variance be a deterministic
   function of the mean. This assumption may not be met for a particular
   data set, that is, the model may not adequately capture the variability
   in the data. The extra-variability in the data may be accommodated using
   overdispersion models, such as the negative binomial distribution. In
   addition to the overdispersion outliers may be present in the data as
   indicated by the model residuals or some functions of the model
   residuals. A variance shift outlier model (VSOM) for count data is
   introduced. The model is used to detect potential outliers in the data,
   and to down-weight them in the analysis if desired. In this model the
   overdispersion is modeled using an observation-specific random effect.
   The status of a given observation as an outlier is indicated by the size
   of the associated shift in variance for that observation. The model is
   then extended to longitudinal count data for the detection of outliers
   at the subject level. We illustrate the methodology using a real data
   set taken from the literature. Extensions of the VSOM for count data to
   other non-normal responses are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   CaXH3 compounds have been optimized in cubic crystal structure and the
   lattice constants of studied compounds have been obtained as 3.60, 3.50,
   and 3.48 angstrom for X: Mn, Fe, and Co compounds, respectively. The
   optimized structures have negative formation enthalpies pointing out
   that studied compounds are thermodynamically stable and could be
   synthesized experimentally. The gravimetric hydrogen storage densities
   of X: Mn, Fe, and Co compounds were found in as 3.09, 3.06, and 2.97
   wt\%, respectively. The revealed values for hydrogen storage densities
   indicate that CaXH3 compounds may be potential candidates for hydrogen
   storage applications. Moreover, various mechanical parameters of
   interest compounds like elastic constants, bulk modulus, and Poisson's
   ratio have been reported throughout the study. These compounds were
   found mechanically stable with satisfying Born stability criteria.
   Further analyses based on Cauchy pressure and Pugh criterion, showed
   that they have brittleness nature and relatively hard materials. In
   addition, the electronic characteristics, band structures, and
   associated partial density of states of CaXH3 hydrides have been
   revealed. The dynamic stability behavior of them was verified based on
   the phonon dispersion curves.}},

Abstract = {{A novel porous mechanical metamaterial with variable Poisson's ratio
   (VPR) is proposed for compression and impact applications. Constructed
   by stacking layers of varying void aspect ratio, VPR structures combine
   the collapsing penetration resistance of auxetic materials with the
   lateral expansion of positive Poisson's ratio (PPR) materials. The
   concept is analyzed via numerical simulation of both compression and
   impact loading of VPR structures composed of silicone rubber. In
   addition, compression testing is performed with deformation maps
   obtained through digital image correlation. Results indicate that VPR
   structures, compared with uniform porous PPR structures, are resistant
   to global buckling instabilities. Moreover, in low-energy impact events,
   VPR structures respond to the impulse with a comparable force spread
   over a longer time than uniform PPR structures of the same porosity. At
   impact energies above approximately 45 J, the considered silicone VPR
   structures transition to a regime of more sharply peaked force response.
   At all energies, VPR structures deform more smoothly than their porous
   PPR counterparts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Ultrasonic study of the temperature and pressure dependences of the
   elastic properties of beta-silicon nitride ceramic}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2557-2563}},
Abstract = {{Ultrasonic wave velocity measurements have been used to determine the
   elastic stiffness moduli and related elastic properties of high-purity,
   dense beta -Si3N4 ceramic samples as functions of temperature in the
   range 150-295 K and hydrostatic pressure up to 0.2 GPa at room
   temperature. Due to its covalently bonded, rigid structural framework
   beta -Si3N4 is an elastically stiff material; the elastic stiffness
   moduli of the ceramic at 295 K are: C-L = 396 GPa, mu = 119 GPa, B-S =
   238 GPa, E = 306 GPa, Poisson's ratio sigma = 0.285. The longitudinal
   elastic stiffness C-L increases with decreasing temperature and shows a
   knee at about 235 K; the decrease in slope below the knee indicates mode
   softening. The shear elastic stiffness mu shows mode softening which
   results in a plateau centred at about 235 K and an anomalous decrease
   with further reduction in temperature. The hydrostatic-pressure
   derivatives of elastic stiffnesses at 295 K are (partial
   derivativeC(L)/partial derivativeP)(P)=0 = 4.5 +/- 0.1, (partial
   derivativeB(S)/partial derivativeP)(P)=0 = 4.3 +/- 0.1 and (partial
   derivative mu/partial derivativeP)(P)=0 = 0.17 +/- 0.02 (pressure < 0.12
   GPa). An interesting feature of the nonlinear acoustic behaviour of this
   ceramic is that, in the pressure range above 0.12 GPa, the values
   obtained for (partial derivative mu/partial derivativeP)(P)=0 and the
   shear mode Gruneisen parameter (gamma (S)) are small and negative,
   indicating acoustic-mode softening under these higher pressures. Both
   the anomalous temperature and pressure dependences of the shear elastic
   stiffness indicate incipient lattice shear instability. The shear gamma
   (S)(=0.005) is much smaller than the longitudinal gamma (L)(=1.18)
   accounting for the thermal Gruneisen parameter gamma (t)h(=1.09): since
   the acoustic Debye temperature Theta (D)(=923 +/- 5 K) is so high, the
   shear modes play an important role in acoustic phonon population at room
   temperature. Hence knowledge of the elastic and nonlinear acoustic
   properties sheds light on the thermal properties of ceramic beta -Si3N4.

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{The thermodynamic, mechanical and dynamic properties of TcB3 and MoB3
   are systematically investigated at high-pressure by first-principles
   within density functional theory (DFT). The calculated formation
   enthalpies are negative for TcB3 with considered structures under the
   pressure range from 0 to 100 GPa. Triboride hP4-TcB3 (i.e., TcB3 in
   hP4-OsB3 type structure) has the lowest formation enthalpy of -1.44 eV
   under ambient condition. The largest shear modulus of 240 GPa and
   smallest Poisson's ratio of 0.20 for oP16-TcB3 are comparable to those
   of 267 GPa and 0.15 for ReB2. The calculated elastic constants show that
   MB3 (M=Tc and Mo) are mechanically stable at ambient conditions, except
   for mP8-MoB3. The estimated high hardness of 33.4 and 33.1 GPa for
   oP16-TcB3 and hP4-TcB3, respectively, are reported for the first time.
   The calculated lattice parameters for MoB3 are in good agreement with
   the previously theoretical and experimental studies. Below 13 GPa,
   hP16-MoB3 and hR24-MoB3 are thermodynamically more favorable than MoB3
   in other structures. A pressure-induced phase transition is predicted at
   13 GPa from hP16-MoB3 and hR24-MoB3 to hP4-MoB3. Above 13 GPa, hP4-MoB3
   becomes the thermodynamically most stable phase among MoB3 in considered
   structures. All compounds with considered structures are metallic, and
   the electronic structures of MB3 are governed by a strong hybridization
   between M-4d and B-2p states. The strong and directional covalent
   bonding between M-4d and B-2p as well as the strong interlayer
   interactions of boron layers are correlated to the high hardness of 38.0
   and 38.4 GPa for hP16-MoB3 and hR24-MoB3, respectively.}},

Title = {{Time series count data models: An empirical application to traffic

Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Count data are primarily categorised as cross-sectional, time series,
   and panel. Over the past decade, Poisson and Negative Binomial (NB)
   models have been used widely to analyse cross-sectional and time series
   count data, and random effect and fixed effect Poisson and NB models
   have been used to analyse panel count data. However, recent literature
   suggests that although the underlying distributional assumptions of
   these models are appropriate for cross-sectional count data, they are
   not capable of taking into account the effect of serial correlation
   often found in pure time series count data. Real-valued time series
   models, such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
   model, introduced by Box and Jenkins have been used in many applications
   over the last few decades. However, when modelling non-negative
   integer-valued data such as traffic accidents at a junction over time,
   Box and Jenkins models may be inappropriate. This is mainly due to the
   normality assumption of errors in the ARIMA model. Over the last few
   years, a new class of time series models known as integer-valued
   autoregressive (INAR) Poisson models, has been studied by many authors.
   This class of models is particularly applicable to the analysis of time
   series count data as these models hold the properties of Poisson
   regression and able to deal with serial correlation, and therefore
   offers an alternative to the real-valued time series models.
   The primary objective of this paper is to introduce the class of INAR
   models for the time series analysis of traffic accidents in Great
   Britain. Different types of time series count data are considered:
   aggregated time series data where both the spatial and temporal units of
   observation are relatively large (e.g., Great Britain and years) and
   disaggregated time series data where both the spatial and temporal units
   are relatively small (e.g., congestion charging zone and months). The
   performance of the INAR models is compared with the class of Box and
   Jenkins real-valued models. The results suggest that the performance of
   these two classes of models is quite similar in terms of coefficient
   estimates and goodness of fit for the case of aggregated time series
   traffic accident data. This is because the mean of the counts is high in
   which case the normal approximations and the ARIMA model may be
   satisfactory. However, the performance of INAR Poisson models is found
   to be much better than that of the ARIMA model for the case of the
   disaggregated time series traffic accident data where the counts is
   relatively low. The paper ends with a discussion on the limitations of
   INAR models to deal with the seasonality and unobserved heterogeneity.

Abstract = {{Mixing of lithographically processable materials with functional
   additives is one of the widely explored possibilities in the field of
   the laser material processing. In this work we investigate how gold
   nanoparticles (Au NP) influence the photosensitivity of S Z2080 and
   PEG-DA-700 - two materials commonly used in femtosecond 3D direct laser
   writing (DLW). Experimental study of achieved line widths as well as
   comparison of polymerization/optical damage threshold intensities
   allowed quantitatively define how Au NP change polymers' response to
   ultrafast laser pulses. Light-material and plasmonic interaction
   theories are applied to explain this phenomena. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate how nanoprecision achieved with DLW can be employed to
   create functional micromechanical structures, namely negative Poisson
   coefficient metamaterial and chain-mail like flexible structure. Later
   one is produced using combination of linear stages and galvanoscanners,
   demonstrating nearly unlimited working area (in range of similar to cm)
   and very high translation velocity (similar to mm/s) thus proving that
   DLW can be considered an industrial grade technology.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{We report first-principles calculations of electronic and mechanical
   properties of few-layer borophene with the inclusion of interlayer van
   der Waals (vdW) interaction. The anisotropic metallic behaviors are
   preserved from monolayer to few-layer structures. The energy splitting
   of bilayer borophene at Gamma point near the Fermi level is about 1.7
   eV, much larger than the values (0.5-1 eV) of other layered
   semiconductors, indicating much stronger vdW interactions in metallic
   layered borophene. In particular, the critical strains are enhanced by
   increasing the number of layers, leading to much more flexibility than
   that of monolayer structure. On the one hand, because of the buckled
   atomic structures, the out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratios are
   preserved as the layer number increases. On the other hand, we find that
   the in-plane negative Poisson's ratios disappear in layered borophene,
   which is very different from puckered black phosphorus. The negative
   Poisson's ratio will recover if we enlarge the interlayer distance to
   6.3 angstrom. The physical origin behind the change of Poisson's ratios
   is the strong interlayer vdW interaction in layered borophene.}},

Abstract = {{Examples of chiral materials include some auxetic materials, bones, some
   honeycomb structures, as well as composites with inclusions. The chiral
   effects cannot be described within classical elasticity. In the context
   of the linear theory of Cosserat elastic solids, we investigate the
   deformation of a chiral rod subjected to tractions on the lateral
   surface, to body loads, and to resultant forces and moments on the ends.
   The work is motivated by the recent interest in the using of the
   Cosserat elastic solid as model for auxetic composites, carbon nanotubes
   and bones. The three-dimensional problem is reduced to the study of some
   generalized plane strain problems. New chiral effects are presented. In
   the case of cylinders of arbitrary cross-section, the flexure produced
   by a transversal force, in contrast with the case of achiral materials,
   is accompanied by extension and bending by terminal couples. The body
   loads and the tractions on the lateral surface produce extension,
   flexure, torsion, bending by terminal couples and a plane strain. It is
   shown that a uniform pressure acting on the lateral surface of a chiral
   circular cylinder does not produce bending effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Replacement of native forests by forest plantations may change the
   composition and abundance of small mammals, thus influencing the
   foraging behavior of mesocarnivores in these human-created habitats. We
   assessed how differences in prey abundance between native forests and
   exotic plantations in southern Chile may explain the prey selection of
   four mesocarnivores, as analyzed from their scats. Using a spatial
   zero-inflated Poisson model, we determined that the abundance of most
   small mammals was lower in plantations than native forests, except for
   three common species, which had similar or larger abundances in exotic
   plantations. We assessed mesocarnivores' prey selection by assessing the
   coefficients and log-ratios of use and availability of a Bayesian
   Resource Selection Function. We determined that in native forest, the
   preferences of kodkod (Leopardus guigna) for arboreal prey was stronger,
   whereas chilla fox (Pseudalopex griseus) and Darwin's fox (Pseudalopex
   fuhdpes) exhibited a selective preference for ground prey. Darwin's fox
   also exhibited a habitat-dependent changes in their selection for
   Darwin's leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini), from a positive log ratio
   in native forest to a negative ratio in exotic plantations. Conversely,
   culpeo fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus) selected long-tailed colilargo
   (Oligoriaomys longicaudatus) and Chilean climbing mouse (Irenomys
   tarsalis) in plantations only, even though these prey were more abundant
   in native forests. Although mature commercial forest plantations may
   provide feeding grounds for mesocarnivores, depending on their
   species-specific ability to capture available prey, the decline of small
   mammal availability in plantations may modify the prey selection of
   mesocarnivores. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{24}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a total of five 3D re-entrant honeycomb (RH) specimens
   made of polyamide were fabricated with various configurations by using
   additive manufacturing (AM) technique. Uniaxial quasi-static compressive
   tests were conducted on the RH specimens. The damage modes, the
   stress-strain curves and Poisson's ratios were recorded and analysed.
   The five specimens exhibited negative Poisson's ratios between-0.105
   and-0.193. The effects of geometric parameters on the mechanical
   properties were analysed and discussed. In addition, 3D finite element
   (FE) models were established by using a commercial finite element
   software (ANSYS), and verified by comparing the predicted stress-strain
   curves and deformation patterns with the experimental results.
   Furthermore, an analytical model of 3D RH unit cell under uniaxial
   compression was proposed based on Timoshenko beam theory and large
   deflection beam theory. The proposed analytical model can well predict
   the mechanical properties of 3D RH unit under compression.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic tensor of any triangular (2D) lattice material is given with
   respect to the geometry and the mechanical properties of the links
   between the nodes. The links can bear central forces (tensional
   material, for example with hinged joints), momentums (flexural
   materials) or a combination of the two. The symmetry class of the

   Forte and Vianello. A distinction is made between the trivial cases
   where the elasticity symmetry group corresponds to the microstructure's
   symmetry group and the non-trivial cases in the opposite case.
   Interesting examples of isotropic auxetic materials (with negative
   Poisson's ratio) and non-trivial materials with isotropic elasticity but
   anisotropic fracturation (weak direction) are shown. The proposed set of

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{This study provides the reader with a methodology for directly deriving
   basic streamflow statistics (mean, variance, and correlation
   coefficient) from long-term recorded daily rainfall data. A daily
   streamflow sequence is considered as a filtered point process where the
   input is a storm time sequence that is assumed to be a marked point
   process. The mark is the storm magnitude that is constructed from a
   daily rainfall time series, and the correlation of the daily rainfall
   during the storm is considered. The number of storms is a counting
   process represented by either the binomial, the Poisson, or the negative
   binomial probability distribution, depending on its ratio of mean versus
   variance. As a pulse-response function for a filtered point process, the
   model of three serial tanks with a parallel tank is adopted to describe
   the physical process of rainfall-runoff. Thus the basic statistics
   (mean, variance, and covariance function) of J-day averaged streamflows
   can be estimated in terms of the constants expressing stochastic
   properties of a rainfall time series and the tank model's parameters
   representing the causal relationship between rainfall and runoff. The
   method is used to derive the streamflow statistics of an actual dam
   basin, the Sameura Dam basin, located in Shikoku island, Japan. The
   resulting computed means and variances of 5-day averaged streamflows
   show a good correspondence with observed ones.}},

   amorphous configurations, and electrical polarization interface layers
   are formed between silver nanoparticles and polyethylene matrix. The
   interface region shrinks and expends respectively with nanoparticle
   dimension and temperature increasing. Compared with polyethylene system,
   the polyethylene/silver-nanoparticle composite presents explicitly high
   polarizability which increases with temperature and nanoparticle size
   rising simultaneously. The silver nanopaticle dimension directly
   influences the intensity and frequency of interfacial dipole moment,
   resulting in corresponding variations of peak position and intensity in
   infrared spectrum. The polyethylene/silver-nanoparticle composite also
   shows higher isometric heat capacity and negative thermal pressure
   coefficient with better temperature stability, which decreases
   explicitly with temperature and nanoparticle size increasing
   respectively, than polyethylene system. The mechanical property of
   polyethylene/silver-nanoparticle composite shows isotropic elastic
   constant tensor with considerably higher Young modulus and Poisson ratio
   than the polyethylene system, both of which decrease with temperature
   and nanoparticle dimension increasing, which indicates the improvement
   on mechanical property with Ag nanoparticle filler.}},

   metamaterials}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Cutting various patterns in elastomeric sheets has emerged as a simple
   yet effective way to fabricate soft mechanical metamaterials with
   unusual or auxetic properties. Upon stretching, the cut ligaments of the
   metamaterial deform severely and much higher stress is induced around
   the notch due to stress concentration. This would limit the
   stretchability or even result in fracture of the cut-mediated
   metamaterials. Optimization of cut-mediated mechanical materials has
   been rarely, if at all, been explored, partially due to the difficulty
   of nonlinear optimization and analysis of materials with large
   deformation. We present an integrated strategy and a platform based on
   commercial software to optimize cut-mediated soft mechanical
   metamaterials. Optimization of the metamaterial is realized by modifying
   the boundary shape of cut ligaments, which would reduce stress
   concentration, generate larger negative Poisson's ratio, and allow
   enhanced stretchability. Our optimization scheme of metamaterials would
   aid design and fabrication of mechanical metamaterials and transforming
   structures.}},

Title = {{Mechanical Properties of Additively Manufactured Thick Honeycombs}},
Journal = {{Materials}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Honeycombs resemble the structure of a number of natural and biological
   materials such as cancellous bone, wood, and cork. Thick honeycomb could
   be also used for energy absorption applications. Moreover, studying the
   mechanical behavior of honeycombs under in-plane loading could help
   understanding the mechanical behavior of more complex 3D tessellated
   structures such as porous biomaterials. In this paper, we study the
   mechanical behavior of thick honeycombs made using additive
   manufacturing techniques that allow for fabrication of honeycombs with
   arbitrary and precisely controlled thickness. Thick honeycombs with
   different wall thicknesses were produced from polylactic acid (PLA)
   using fused deposition modelling, i.e., an additive manufacturing
   technique. The samples were mechanically tested in-plane under
   compression to determine their mechanical properties. We also obtained
   exact analytical solutions for the stiffness matrix of thick hexagonal
   honeycombs using both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories. The
   stiffness matrix was then used to derive analytical relationships that
   describe the elastic modulus, yield stress, and Poisson's ratio of thick
   honeycombs. Finite element models were also built for computational
   analysis of the mechanical behavior of thick honeycombs under
   compression. The mechanical properties obtained using our analytical
   relationships were compared with experimental observations and
   computational results as well as with analytical solutions available in
   the literature. It was found that the analytical solutions presented
   here are in good agreement with experimental and computational results
   even for very thick honeycombs, whereas the analytical solutions
   available in the literature show a large deviation from experimental
   observation, computational results, and our analytical solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The characterization of the mechanical properties of crystalline
   materials is nowadays considered a routine computational task in DFT
   calculations. However, its high computational cost still prevents it
   from being used in high-throughput screening methodologies, where a
   cheaper estimate of the elastic properties of a material is required. In
   this work, we have investigated the accuracy of force field calculations
   for the prediction of mechanical properties and, in particular, for the
   characterization of the directional Poisson's ratio. We analyze the
   behavior of about 600 000 hypothetical zeolitic structures at the
   classical level (a scale 3 orders of magnitude larger than previous
   studies), to highlight generic trends between mechanical properties and
   energetic stability. By comparing these results with DFT calculations on
   991 zeolitic frameworks, we highlight the limitations of force field
   predictions, in particular for predicting auxeticity. We then used this
   reference DFT data as a training set for a machine learning algorithm,
   showing that it offers a way to build fast and reliable predictive
   models for anisotropic properties. The accuracies obtained are, in
   particular, much better than the current ``cheap{''} approach for
   screening, which is the use of force fields. These results are a
   significant improvement over the previous work, due to the more
   difficult nature of the properties studied, namely, the anisotropic
   elastic response. It is also the first time such a large training data
   set is used for zeolitic materials.}},

Journal = {{INFECTIOUS AGENTS AND CANCER}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Little information on the prevalence of Kaposi's sarcoma
   associated herpesvirus (KSHV) among HIVnegative individuals is available
   from Asia.
   Methods: In the present study, we report findings from a new survey of
   KSHV in 983 HIV-negative male migrants from Shanghai and their
   combination with previous similar surveys of 600 female migrants, 600
   female sex-workers (FSW), 1336 sexually transmitted infection (STI)
   clinic male patients, 439 intravenous drug-users (IVDU), and 226 men
   having sex with men (MSM) from China. KSHV-specific antibodies against
   latent and lytic antigens were assessed using Sf9 and BC3 monoclonal
   immunofluorescence assay. Age-adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95\%
   confidence interval (95\% CI) for KSHV-positivity were estimated using
   Poisson regression.
   Results: In total, 4184 HIV-negative participants were included. KSHV
   prevalence ranged from 9.8\% (95\% CI: 7.9\%-11.7\%) in male migrants to
   32.3\% (95\% CI: 24.1\%-34.1\%) in MSM. IVDU show intermediate level
   (17.5\%, 95\% CI: 14.1\%-21.4\%). KSHV was associated with syphilis (PR
   = 2.03, 95\% CI: 1.38-2.98) in MSM but not in other groups. An
   association with human herpes virus 2 was also found among MSM (PR = 1.
   83, 95\%: 1.22-2.75) but not in migrant workers or FSW.
   Conclusions: KSHV prevalence in HIV-negative heterosexuals, FSW, and STI
   male patients from China is approximately 10\%, but 2-and 3-fold higher
   in IVDU and MSM, respectively. Associations of KSHV with STIs among MSM
   only suggest that sexual transmission of the virus is important in MSM
   but not in heterosexuals.}},

Abstract = {{Iron-gallium alloys can produce magnetostrictions of similar to400 ppm
   and might function as mechanically robust actuator/sensing materials.
   Single crystal specimens of Fe-17 at.\% Ga were tested in tension at
   room temperature. Specimens with a {[} 1 1 0 ] tensile axis orientation
   exhibited \{ 1 1 0\}< 1 1 1 > slip and an ultimate tensile strength of
   580 MPa through 1.6\% elongation. The Young's modulus was 160 GPa in the
   loading direction with a Poisson's ratio of -0.37 on the ( 1 0 0 ) major
   face. A specimen with a {[} 1 0 0 ] tensile axis orientation exhibited
   \{ 2 1 1 \} < 1 1 1 > slip and discontinuous yielding. A maximum tensile
   strength of 515 MPa was observed with fracture occurring after 2\%
   elongation. The Young's modulus was 65 GPa in the loading direction with
   a Poisson's ratio of 0.45 on the (0 0 1) major face. A sizeable elastic
   anisotropy of 19.9 was identified for Fe-27.2 at.\% Ga accompanied by a
   Poisson's ratio of -0.75 to produce a large in-plane auxetic behavior.

Abstract = {{MOST materials shrink laterally and become less dense when stretched.
   Materials that both expand laterally (that is, have negative Poisson's
   ratio) and densify when stretched are of interest both from the
   fundamental and the practical points of view1-5. A few monocrystalline
   phases with negative Poisson's ratio are known3,4, but these do not
   densify when stretched. Here we present molecular-mechanics calculations
   for some hypothetical phases of carbon which exhibit both kinds of
   behaviour. The properties derive from the presence of bonds that act as
   hinges in extended helical chains. Other unusual properties of these
   phases include negative thermal expansion, dopant-controlled porosity
   and low-temperature polymorphism. Such structures can be envisaged for
   polyacetylene, polydiacetylene, polyphenylene and (BN)x phases, as well
   as for variants of some known, structurally related inorganic phases.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the inverse problem of retrieving aerosol extinction
   coefficients from Raman lidar measurements. In this problem the unknown
   and the data are related through the exponential of a linear operator,
   the unknown is non-negative and the data follow the Poisson
   distribution. Standard methods work on the log-transformed data and
   solve the resulting linear inverse problem, but neglect to take into
   account the noise statistics. In this study we show that proper
   modelling of the noise distribution can improve substantially the
   quality of the reconstructed extinction profiles. To achieve this goal,
   we consider the non-linear inverse problem with non-negativity
   constraint, and propose two iterative algorithms derived using the
   Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. We validate the algorithms with synthetic
   and experimental data. As expected, the proposed algorithms out-perform
   standard methods in terms of sensitivity to noise and reliability of the
   estimated profile.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter is dedicated to the presentation of examples of application
   of the Virtual Fields Method to soft materials like foams and elastomers
   and biological materials such as wood and biological tissues. These have
   been grouped together because they share some common features such as
   high deformability (often implying the measurement of large strains) and
   high material variability (for wood or tissues). In terms of measurement
   techniques, the large strain issue means that digital image correlation
   will be the ideal technique for full-field measurements, whereas medical
   imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance elastography can be used
   for tissues (particularly for in vivo studies). As far as the VFM is
   concerned, large deformations will imply the use of the principle of
   virtual work within the framework of the mechanics of large deformation,
   using adequate tensors in either the reference or deformed
   configurations. Hyperelasticity can then be used to describe the large
   strain behavior of foams or elastomer, as well as some biological
   tissues. In this section, the following applications are described:
   hyperelastic law identification on elastomers, tangent Poisson's ratio
   identification of a low density polymeric auxetic (negative Poisson's
   ratio) foams, and the use of magnetic resonance based measurements for
   biological tissues and phantoms (synthetic materials mimicking the
   behavior of tissues). Finally, some examples on wood are also be
   presented that share many common features with the examples in Chap. 6
   on composites.}},

Abstract = {{The equivalent in-plane properties for hexagonal and re-entrant
   (auxetic) lattices are investigated through the analysis of partial
   differential equations associated with their homogenized continuum
   models. The adopted homogenization technique interprets the discrete
   lattice equations according to a finite differences formalism, and it is
   applied in conjunction with the finite element description of the
   lattice unit cell. It therefore allows handling of structures with
   different levels of complexity and internal geometry within a general
   and compact framework, which can be easily implemented. The estimation
   of the mechanical properties is carried out through a comparison between
   the derived differential equations and appropriate elasticity models.
   Equivalent Young's moduli, Poisson's ratios and relative density are
   estimated and compared with analytical formulae available in the
   literature. In-plane wave propagation characteristics of honeycombs are
   also investigated to evaluate phase velocity variation in terms of
   frequency and direction of propagation. Comparisons are performed with
   the values obtained through the application of Bloch theorem for
   two-dimensional periodic structures, to show the accuracy of the
   technique and highlight limitations introduced by the long wavelength
   approximation associated with the homogenization technique. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{The wave propagation in sandwich beams with cellular core is analyzed
   and controlled. The material properties of cellular cores are highly
   dependent on the geometry of the cell composing the honeycomb structure.
   Core materials of different geometry placed periodically along the beam
   length introduce the proper impedance mismatch necessary to impede the
   propagation of waves along the beam.
   A Spectral Finite Element model is developed to describe the wave
   propagation characteristics and the vibration of the sandwich beam. The
   model uses dynamic shape functions obtained from the solution of the
   corresponding distributed parameter model and thus allows for predicting
   the dynamic behavior of the structure with a significantly reduced
   number of elements as compared with the conventional FEM.
   The model is used to derive the transfer matrix of the sandwich beam,
   which identifies the location of the frequency bands where traveling
   waves are attenuated. The influence of core geometry and periodicity on
   the location and extension of these stop bands is assessed through a
   series of simulations. The effect of the periodicity of the structure is
   also evaluated by considering the vibration response of a clamped free
   beam excited by the harmonic motion of the base. The results demonstrate
   the simplicity and the effectiveness of the proposed treatment whereby
   the transmission of waves and the vibration over specified frequency
   bands can be significantly reduced without requiring additional passive
   or active control devices. The unique characteristics of cellular solids
   therefore can be used to design light-weight composite panels that
   behave as mechanical filters. The filtering capabilities of such passive
   composite panels may be easily changed and optimized to reduce their
   transmissibility over a desired frequency range without compromising the
   size and the weight of the structure.}},

Abstract = {{The architected mechanical metamaterials have garnered significant
   research attention for a variety of engineering application due to their
   remarkable mechanical properties and unique deformation behavior.
   Herein, the in-plane uniaxial compressive response and energy absorption
   capacity of a novel hybrid configuration, AuxHex structure, which
   consists of auxetic and hexagonal honeycomb cells, are systematically
   investigated through theoretical, finite element simulation and
   experimental methods. A series of AuxHex sandwich core panels have been
   fabricated with nylon material by using additive manufacturing route.
   The relationships for Young's modulus and plastic collapse stress along
   different loading directions are derived and validated through the
   comparative analysis. In addition, the deformation mechanism and failure
   modes of the AuxHex structure have also been discussed in detail. The
   AuxHex structures have exhibited superior Young's modulus, collapse
   strength and energy absorption than traditional honeycomb structures. In
   the x-direction, the energy absorption capacity was improved by 38\%,
   which can be attributed to the uniform and stable deformation mode of
   the unit cell. The theoretical prediction results of Young's modulus and
   plastic collapse stress are consistent with finite element simulation
   and experimental results. The AuxHex structures demonstrate a novel
   design strategy for the architected metamaterials through the
   combination of various cellular cells. The hybrid structures will play
   an important role in both the load-bearing and energy-absorbing
   applications, and it demonstrates a novel design strategy for the

Abstract = {{We investigate the effective stress-strain behavior of cellular

   means of full scale simulations under small deformations. First, we show
   that the elastic response behaves non trivially with the pore geometry.
   In particular, we show that auxetic and anistropic responses arise for a
   broad range of parameters, when the microstructure becomes sufficiently
   porous. Second, we show that, in the limit of large and near -circular
   holes, the stress-strain nonlinearities become very large. Third, we
   adopt an effective theoretical description where the filaments between
   the holes are modeled by slender beams to predict the linear response,
   and by bars and pivots to capture the leading order nonlinear
   corrections. This approach fully captures the asymptotic observations
   and open pathways for an effective-beams based homogenization and the
