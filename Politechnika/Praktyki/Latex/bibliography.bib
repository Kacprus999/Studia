    abstract = {Vibration and sound control is critical to many practical engineering systems in order to minimise the detrimental effects caused by unavoidable vibrations and noises. Metamaterials and origami-based structures, which have attracted increasing interests in interdisciplinary research fields, possess many peculiar physical properties, including negative Poisson’s ratios, bi- or multi-stable states, nonlinear and tuneable stiffness features, and thus offer promising applications for vibration and sound control. This paper presents a review of metamaterials and origami-based structures as well as their applications to vibration and sound control. Metamaterials are artificially engineered materials having extremal properties which are not found in conventional materials. Metamaterials with abnormal features are firstly discussed on the basis of the unusual values of their elastic constants. Recent advances of auxetic, band gap and pentamode metamaterials are reviewed together with their applications to vibration and sound mitigations. Origami, as the ancient Japanese art of paper folding, has emerged as a new design paradigm for different applications. Origami-based structures can be adopted for vibration isolation by using their multi-stable states and desirable stiffness characteristics. Different origami patterns are reviewed to show their configurations and base structures. Special features, such as bi- or multi-stable states, dynamic Poisson’s ratios, and nonlinear force–displacement relationships are discussed for their applications for vibration control. Finally, possible future research directions are elaborated for this emerging and promising interdisciplinary research field.}

	journal = {Nanotechnology},
	abstract = {A new two-dimensional carbon-based material consisting of pentagonal and hexagonal elements is identified by numerical experiments, which is called phgraphene and possesses not only a tunable semimetallic feature but also a direction-dependent even sign-changed Poisson’s ratio. The structural stability of such a new material is first checked systematically. It is found that phgraphene has a similar energy as the γ-graphyne, a thermally stable structure from the room temperature to 1500 K, and elastic constants satisfying the Born–Huang criterion. Both the band structure and density of states are further verified with different techniques, which demonstrate a Dirac semimetallic characteristic of phgraphene. A more interesting finding is that the band structure can be easily tuned by an external loading, resulting in the transition from semimetal to semiconductor or from type I to type III. As a new material that may be applied in the future, the mechanical property of phgraphene is further evaluated. It shows that phgraphene is a typically anisotropic material, which has not only direction-dependent Young’s moduli but also direction-dependent even sign-changed Poisson’s ratios. The microscopic mechanisms of both the electrical and mechanical properties are revealed. Such a versatile material with tunable band structure and auxetic effect should have promising applications in the advanced nano-electronic field in the future.}

    abstract = {This paper examines the in-plane negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) effect on the thermal postbuckling of graphene-reinforced metal matrix composite (GRMMC) laminated beams subjected to a uniform temperature rise and supported by an elastic foundation. GRMMC layers having different graphene volume fractions can facilitate the formation of functionally graded (FG) patterns of the beams. The temperature-dependent material properties of GRMMC layers can be estimated by a nonlinear function of temperature from the results of the molecular dynamics simulations. The governing equations for the beam thermal postbuckling problem can be derived based on a higher order shear deformation beam theory and solved by applying the two-step perturbation approach. The von Kármán geometric nonlinearity, the elastic foundation support and the thermal effect are considered in the modeling. Numerical investigations are carried out for (10/-10/10/-10/10)S and (10/-10/10)S GRMMC beams with in-plane NPR. The results show that the buckling temperature of (10/-10/10)S UD beam is slightly higher than that of (10/-10/10/-10/10)S UD beam. The thermal postbuckling capacity for the (10/-10/10)S FG-X beam becomes much higher than that of the (10/-10/10/-10/10)S FG-X beam, when the beam deflection is sufficiently large.}
